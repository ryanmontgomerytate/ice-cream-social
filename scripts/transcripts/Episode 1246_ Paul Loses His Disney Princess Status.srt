1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
 Oh, hello there! I didn't see you there, but I'm so glad you're here because I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,000
 Thank you so much, ice cream truck drivers. Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,800
 Well, these are the folks that deliver that ice cream straight to your ear holes.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,200
 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
 Yeah, I'd love to!

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
 Great! Let's go!

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
 Alright.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 How many guys do you need here? No problem, here we go!

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Good to see you here!

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,400
 Everything's fine!

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
 It's time for Matt Maddly's Ice Cream Social!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly!

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, and it's Paul Maddingly!

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,200
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy!

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
 We're PreachingFun!

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
 Yeah!

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,800
 You know, like, it is kind of like, for desk, ScoopFest tends to always be around some fiery times.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
 It sure does!

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 Well, the Scoopocalypse actually got cancelled because of the fucking thing!

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
 We cancelled the Scoopocalypse!

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,000
 Yeah, because of an apocalypse!

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,800
 And I remember having Penn on, you know, when Trump got elected and stuff.

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,200
 It was the very first time. It was crazy.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:09,600
 And I, you know, I actually only got a direct hateful email once for talking about politics on this show from a listener.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
 Okay!

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,800
 And it was when I said, "If you don't want to vote, if you want to sit out this election, vote for Joe Biden."

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,000
 And the reason why is because your life will simply be easier.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,200
 I said, "You simply elect a guy who doesn't demand to command the news cycle, morning, news, and night."

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
 Leading into Trump's second run for president, right?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
 When he was running against Biden, yeah.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
 Yeah, when he ended up losing to Biden, yeah.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,400
 And that was the only time I got a hateful email from one of our listeners who was a Trump supporter.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
 Oh, interesting!

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,200
 Yeah, I thought you were going to say you got a hateful email, not a hateful email,

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,000
 but an upset email from a listener saying that it was going to be more than just ease and convenience.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,200
 I thought it was going to go the other way, but it was from a Trump supporter.

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:13,400
 Yeah, and it is exhausting to have such a petty, vindictive egotist in an office.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,800
 And then to have a bunch of people who voted for Bayer ready to enact things, it's tough.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,200
 And so obviously, this is all coming to light in terms of Jimmy Kimmel being taken off the air.

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,800
 And also a week out from the Charlie Kirk assassination, which is a very big deal.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
 Yeah, of course.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,200
 And an awful event.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,800
 I think, though, it is nuts.

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,200
 I don't think anyone doubts where we lean politically on this show.

50
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
 It doesn't seem like it.

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,000
 Chaotic in chat is offering to send me more hateful emails.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
 Yeah, let's go for it.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
 Oh, no!

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:12,000
 And with ScoopFest on the horizon, I just want to say that we don't pride ourselves on any kind of current political stakes.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It's very easy to be divisive, to be galvanizing.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It's very easy to get people to hate something.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 It's very easy to point at something and say, hey, why aren't we hating this enough and getting more people to hate?

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,400
 And sometimes, and I know this privately off air, we are tempted to.

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
 Of course we are.

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,600
 We are tempted to try to use our platform for good, quote unquote.

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
 Yes, we have opinions and we're loud.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
 We're certainly tempted to share them.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:50,000
 And I just want to say that all of these people joining us on Twitch, all these people joining us on the Zoom, all the people who support us on Patreon,

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,800
 all the people who download us to their apps and listen to us week after week are doing that without us doing that.

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
 Right.

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:09,800
 And so I want to say that I'm so thrilled to be going to ScoopFest, to be spending time with Scoops at this time, because it's just that these people are here for us without us doing

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,400
 bullshit take tactics to maintain our status.

68
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:24,000
 Yeah, I think that's exactly it right now in this current everything community building is of the utmost importance.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,600
 And we have been extremely fortunate in that we have built a very lovely community in the online space where that is a difficult thing to do.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,400
 And that it has been realized in the 3D space is even more impressive and wonderful.

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 The fact that our ScoopFest events have been such highlights for all of us, I think the three of us especially just look forward to these things.

72
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,800
 You know, and again, like I was just saying before in the chat before we got started recording, I'm just so grateful to all of our listeners.

73
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,600
 You guys really fill my heart with a lot of hope, even in these dark times.

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,800
 Double O Groovy in the in the Twitch chat says MPBA make politics boring again. Yeah, for real.

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,000
 Yeah, you know, you know, we're talking, you know, we're looking around talking about like, no, no one speaks for the greater good.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
 No one speaks for the cooler heads prevailing.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:28,800
 You know who did? Joe Biden, you know, and he's unpopular and he is reviled and taken down by by his own party left and right.

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
 And if you look back on what the guy said all the time, he really was always trying to speak for the greater good.

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 And and I'm thinking about him a lot this past week.

80
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:48,000
 I just want to say something like, you know, all that was kind of a lead up for me to say something that I've been kind of biting my tongue on because I know, you know, but I want to say this just in a cool, calm way.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,200
 If you because we have listeners of the trans community in our community, of course.

82
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 And I feel very lucky that we that we do because we're three cisgender straight white dudes, you know.

83
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:16,600
 If you are in any kind of gathering and the word trans comes up and the next word out of someone's mouth is sports, you are failing as an ally.

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 Yeah, it's bad.

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:29,000
 It is an absolute fucking tactic like it matters in any way to anyone.

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,200
 Matt's getting broken up. So I'm going to talk for a second.

87
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:48,000
 But like it, it matters so little to everyone involved, usually except for the trans person that's being yelled at and victimized for living their life.

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 It is such nonsense.

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,400
 I grew up in an area where high school sports, high school athletics, especially high school football was huge, huge.

90
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 One of my classmates from high school is one of the current Thursday Night Football announcers on Amazon Prime.

91
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 And he was the second best player on our football team.

92
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
 We had a hugely successful football team.

93
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 The town was behind it.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
 The school was behind it.

95
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
 It was a big fucking deal.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Out of all of those people that played all those sports and did all those things, you know, a couple of the top guys went on to great success in professional sports.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:45,500
 And everyone else, everyone else, all the hundreds of other people who were involved in it just when I was in school, they went on to have perfectly normal lives that have nothing to do with high school athletics in any way at all or school athletics in any way at all.

98
00:08:45,500 --> 00:09:04,400
 And to make that into such a big talking point, fighting point for people who are trans, just making one more thing for people to have to deal with that no one really cares about in the first place is maddening.

99
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,900
 It's also it is so it is so it's insanity.

100
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,400
 It's unfortunately even dumber than that, Jacob, like in real life, like it is simply that.

101
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,300
 Yes.

102
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,800
 It is simply that that's the only aspect of trans support that polls right.

103
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,500
 Right.

104
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:35,700
 So when it comes to people being able to choose their own gender for their documents, when it comes to people choosing their own gender for protection in the workplace, when it comes to people to choose their own gender, when it comes to forming their own families, that polls left.

105
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,500
 And those are the things that actually affect real life.

106
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 And so the fact that any time I hear the word trans come up and the next thing out of someone's fucking mouth is sports is already a loss.

107
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,700
 It's already an L, like we're already just moving the argument to a place where we're not talking about humanity anymore.

108
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,200
 Right.

109
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,600
 And so, like, I'm just I just want to say this full throatedly, like, like, just be aware of it.

110
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:11,800
 Like, if trans rights comes up and next person brings up sports, you have to get it off the sports as fast as you can.

111
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,000
 You just have to get people to stop talking about sports.

112
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,700
 You just have to do it.

113
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,800
 That's a good call.

114
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,700
 That's a good call.

115
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:32,900
 I think I think, too, to your point, Matt, and for me, this all comes down to people who have not experienced the world.

116
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
 Right. Yeah.

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:45,900
 They have isolated themselves to a degree or at least tried to where they don't come in contact with different people from different backgrounds and different situations.

118
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,600
 Right. Right.

119
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:55,500
 And once you get to know people and you see people are people, that's it.

120
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,000
 Then you understand the frivolity and ludicrousness of these arguments.

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,200
 If there are there are people trying to categorize trans groups as terrorist organizations.

122
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:20,600
 Right. There's a rumor of one of the many shootings that took place this month, that one of the one of the perpetrators was a trans person.

123
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,700
 And there's immediately voices that said they want to introduce legislation to stop trans people from owning weapons.

124
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:40,800
 Huge, huge and to criminalize counselors talking to children who come to them to talk about, you know, possibly being trans and all like taking away.

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:53,900
 It was it was remarkable how fast everything moved as soon as there was a hint that a bad person or somebody a person who did a terrible thing might have been trans.

126
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:06,600
 It was it was it was honestly remarkable and surprising to me how fast everything moved to try to get legal ducks in a row to attack trans people instantly.

127
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:15,700
 I said, if you have been able to get all of these legal ducks in a row so quickly this whole time, why are we still having mass shootings?

128
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,800
 If it's this easy to do the legal process, what are we doing?

129
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,600
 Well, that's exactly it. That's that that that is the most infuriating thing about all this for me, too.

130
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:33,900
 Jacob is how quickly we're seeing so many of the supposed checks and balances just get farted.

131
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:49,400
 Oh, yeah. Right. And what what who's I mean, there's plenty of people that have said it, but it's like it's astounding how much of civility and government in this country exists on a handshake deal.

132
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:57,600
 Yeah, right. Yeah. And if you can't be trusted and if you don't have love in your heart.

133
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,000
 If you don't have love and human compassion and understanding for human beings.

134
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,200
 You know, I think you're going to propose crazy shit, and it's this fucking it's the it's it's this attack on these marginalized groups constantly.

135
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,300
 And I don't know how people can't see it, but they're coming for your ass, too.

136
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,200
 It's it's it's a matter of hours before you are on the wall.

137
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,000
 It is starting with the most marginalized groups out there.

138
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Yeah. And it is moving bigger.

139
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 That is that is we can all see it happening.

140
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,400
 Let's just look at it. They could come for our podcast network next and we would lose tens upon tens of dollars.

141
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,000
 You know, yes. Do you understand?

142
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,400
 Actually, hold on. ABC is actually on the phone.

143
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,700
 Oh, shit. We ABC has canceled us.

144
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
 Oh, my God. Guys, ABC.

145
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,000
 I didn't know we were on ABC. I don't know.

146
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,100
 Canceled on ABC. It's so fucked up.

147
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,400
 I mean, you can no longer find this podcast on ABC.

148
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
 Are you kidding me? Undeniable fact. Undeniable fact.

149
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,100
 Wait a minute. We are no longer on ABC.

150
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,900
 That means I have to give up my Disney princess status.

151
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,600
 You do. You do. You're no longer a Disney princess.

152
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
 God damn it. That was the highlight of my life.

153
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,100
 Look at all of their apps. We are not on there anywhere.

154
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
 We're not. We're not.

155
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
 No. Bunch of bullshit.

156
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,100
 Canceled by ABC.

157
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,600
 And I already had a complicated relationship with Disney.

158
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,700
 But I should say complicated.

159
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,600
 In case anyone's new to the podcast, my mom died in Disney World.

160
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,900
 OK, let's reframe it.

161
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:44,400
 She was a victim of cancel culture.

162
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,700
 She couldn't understand.

163
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,300
 She thought if there's a trans person playing women's basketball,

164
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,800
 she couldn't take it anymore.

165
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,100
 Oh, Lord.

166
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:00,000
 But, you know, yeah, by the way, I want to shout out a couple of people.

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
 One is Justin Robert Young.

168
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,700
 I think a lot of people did a really bad job reporting on this Kimmel thing.

169
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,400
 And Justin Robert Young did a fantastic job breaking down the steps

170
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,100
 and how it went down and when things happened with the chairman of the FCC.

171
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
 Your relationship with the affiliates to do that new guy.

172
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,500
 If you haven't seen any clips of that new guy, what a slimeball.

173
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,000
 He is a character.

174
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
 Yeah, I mean, like, that's the thing.

175
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,900
 If the chairman, I don't care any administration, right?

176
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,700
 I don't care left or right.

177
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,700
 If you have the chairman of the FCC taking like a football

178
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,900
 like victory laps on a media tour, it's crazy.

179
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,400
 Something bad is happening.

180
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,900
 Yeah, it's crazy.

181
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,800
 Yeah, you can look at his actual Twitter account.

182
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,500
 It's like, what the fuck is this guy on?

183
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,400
 Yeah, don't worry, though, because the head of the FBI is there to reel him in.

184
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
 Right, right, right.

185
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
 Checks and balances, everybody.

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
 Yeah, Matt Bellamy, no problem.

187
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,400
 Matt Bellamy from the town podcast also did a really great job

188
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,700
 of just breaking down the politics of what it means to provide programming

189
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,900
 to affiliates still in this modern era and the kind of conflicts you went into.

190
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,500
 And so basically, like it's interesting.

191
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,600
 And then I finally, I'm going to shout out my man Bill Simmons,

192
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
 who's the most popular podcaster.

193
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,500
 He was a popular sports podcaster.

194
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,400
 He famously was a Kimmel writer for a year and a half.

195
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
 Oh, really? In the early years of Kimmel.

196
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
 He left ESPN to write for Kimmel.

197
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,500
 I didn't realize that's like a 22-year ongoing thing.

198
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,800
 I didn't realize he'd been doing that so long.

199
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,700
 I didn't realize Kimmel was such a thing.

200
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,400
 Oh, I mean, he'd been...

201
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,600
 Kimmel's been on the air for a while.

202
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
 I knowed it. I knowed it now.

203
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
 He tried to retire once.

204
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,300
 I guess he did. And they just like talked him out of it.

205
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,700
 I guess you're right.

206
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,700
 But he really helped talk me off the ledge from the Kimmel standpoint,

207
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,100
 not from the government taking power standpoint.

208
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,600
 Thank you for clarifying.

209
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,100
 But basically he was like, hey, you know, when I got fired from ESPN,

210
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,900
 everyone thought I would do, you know,

211
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,300
 you can't make a living in sports without being attached to ESPN.

212
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,000
 And basically he was pointing out that like these affiliates

213
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,400
 in these red states who want advertising for the local news

214
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
 that Kimmel comes on after and carries, right?

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 These people are very happy to follow in line with the FCC chair

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,600
 and say, let's never air him, right?

217
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
 And Disney's only power to fight back and say, all right,

218
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,300
 well, if you don't want Kimmel, I bet you also don't want football

219
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,600
 and you don't want all these other things that we provide, right?

220
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,800
 And that's where the fight is going to be happening behind the scenes right now.

221
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,400
 Okay. And then if you take Kimmel off the air right now,

222
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,100
 you're going to have a bunch of people who live...

223
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,700
 Basically, blue state city people watch things on streaming

224
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,400
 and red state stick in the mud people watch things on TV still.

225
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,600
 And you're supposed to program for both of these people in the modern era

226
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 at a time where we're in the middle of, I mean, it's undeniable,

227
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,100
 a basic civil culture war in the United States.

228
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,200
 Well, and two, Matt, also there is, it's a huge conversation to have

229
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 and I don't even know how to scrape at it, but you said local broadcasters.

230
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,300
 I don't think there's been such a thing for the last 20 years,

231
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,800
 ever since the conglomeration of everything.

232
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,500
 You know, everything's been bought up.

233
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,000
 You've got maybe four blocks of "local broadcasters."

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,500
 Like, you can see tons and tons of clips of local broadcasters.

235
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
 You're talking about Sinclair Broadcasting specifically.

236
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,900
 Exactly. That's one of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,400
 And Nexstar, those are the two ones that are fighting against Kimmel.

238
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,500
 Those are the ones that are always been popularly leaning.

239
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,200
 These are the people that have on their local fields,

240
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,500
 they hand monologues to all of their anchors in every market

241
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 and they make them read conservative...

242
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,400
 So the exact same thing. There's no local news.

243
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,700
 It's just programmed.

244
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,900
 And that's it. And this Nexstar is up for a "merger," right?

245
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,600
 And where they have to break the rule of you can't have more than 39%

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
 of affiliates in North America.

247
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,900
 Which is already insane. Already insane.

248
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,200
 And the number they're trying to get to.

249
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
 Do you know the number, if this deal goes through,

250
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
 do you know how many affiliates they will control in the country?

251
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,800
 I don't.

252
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:22,700
 I have read 82%. 82% is the number that I keep reading.

253
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
 And this is the thing, it's because...

254
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,800
 Oh, shit. ABC just canceled us again.

255
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
 Ah, damn it.

256
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,800
 It's true. If you look on any Disney website,

257
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,600
 you will not find us on it.

258
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,800
 No, no, you won't.

259
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,100
 82% winner scoop.

260
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,600
 Oh, winner scoop in the chat is saying 82%, yeah.

261
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 Yeah. And the reason why this is happening, by the way,

262
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,200
 is because old media is dying.

263
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 Yeah. But while it's dying...

264
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,000
 Oh, yeah. This is the death throes.

265
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Older people are watching it still all the time.

266
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,300
 Older people who don't evolve with modern technology watch it even more, right?

267
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,500
 Right. And so, these people have seized on the opportunity

268
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,600
 to influence the oldest generation.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,200
 And I think that's just the most frustrating thing about all this stuff, right?

270
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,600
 MSNBC, CNN, Fox News,

271
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,700
 the average median age of these people are all upper 70s, right?

272
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,600
 Sure, of course. It's crazy.

273
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 And these are people who are supposed to be enjoying their life well worked, you know?

274
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,500
 They're supposed to be trusting of the next generation

275
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,100
 to carry the nation wherever it's going to go.

276
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,600
 And instead, they've been taught to hate and be paranoid

277
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,300
 and despise these younger people who have no idea what they're doing.

278
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,200
 These younger people who are in their 60s.

279
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,000
 Right, right. That's the crazy shit.

280
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
 These younger people who are also retired.

281
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,400
 Yeah, there are no younger people involved in any of this.

282
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
 I think AOC is the only younger person voice

283
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,200
 that I would even classify as younger person in the government.

284
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
 But that's what I said at the top of the show.

285
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,400
 There's just so much money, even in a giant industry.

286
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,700
 She's 35, by the way. She definitely classifies as younger.

287
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,800
 Yeah.

288
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,400
 There's so much money in pointing at something and saying be afraid of that and hate that.

289
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,600
 Hate that over there and be afraid of that over there.

290
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 Afraid is the word.

291
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,400
 Afraid is the fucking word that drives me crazy in that

292
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,600
 because I really don't think or I know it doesn't start at least as hatred and anger.

293
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,200
 It just starts as fear. All of it just starts as fear.

294
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,700
 Somebody is coming for you.

295
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,400
 Somebody is going to, you know, riot in your town.

296
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
 They're going to loot. They're going to steal things from your shop.

297
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,900
 They're going to destroy the town.

298
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,200
 They're going to burn down buildings. They're going to flip over cars.

299
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,600
 They're going to do all these things.

300
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,300
 You have to take action. You have to...

301
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,800
 It's all fear-based and there's not that much out there to be afraid of.

302
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
 No. Well, that's just it.

303
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,700
 I mean, we've won as far as when we were born.

304
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,300
 We were born into the best time in human history.

305
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,000
 If you look at all the statistics legitimately,

306
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,100
 everything is on the decline so far as crime and all that kind of stuff.

307
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,900
 Of course.

308
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,600
 But, you know, everything can be twisted and jacked up.

309
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,700
 It's fucking great.

310
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,100
 So Simmons basically was like, you know, the famous story of

311
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,400
 Lorne Michaels working on, I think, Laugh-In,

312
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,300
 when the Smothers brothers were taking on Nixon, right?

313
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,100
 Oh, yeah.

314
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,400
 And Lorne Michaels always said,

315
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,700
 "You can take it to the brink, but don't become a martyr."

316
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,200
 You become a martyr, it's short-sighted.

317
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,000
 You take it to the brink and then you fall back and you stay on the air.

318
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
 You do anything to stay on the air.

319
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,200
 Yes.

320
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,100
 And so Kimmel's in this place where obviously they're demanding he donates to

321
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,400
 Charlie Kirk's charities, On Air Apologies,

322
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,700
 all this laundry list of demands that ultimately they still wouldn't be happy with

323
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,000
 if he did anyway.

324
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,800
 Right.

325
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,100
 And that's what kind of created the suspension.

326
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,300
 And, you know, Simmons' point is, hey,

327
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,700
 that was true when TV mattered more than the personality.

328
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
 Yeah, that's true.

329
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,000
 And he pointed out Conan O'Brien.

330
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 He said, look at Conan O'Brien.

331
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,200
 Conan O'Brien did everything to stay on the air, to stay relevant.

332
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,900
 And then when he finally got rid of his TBS show,

333
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,500
 he reinvented himself in his own media format and became more relevant than when he was on TBS.

334
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
 And it just owes to the Oscars and everything else.

335
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
 And we still know who Conan O'Brien is and all that stuff.

336
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,100
 And so Simmons' point, which was really like, oh shit, was like, hey,

337
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,900
 all these late night people are extremely talented and still extremely famous

338
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,800
 and can do a lot of things with themselves as a platform.

339
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,400
 While, sure, late night television is dying,

340
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,700
 but Colbert and Kimmel and all these guys will go nowhere.

341
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,300
 Yeah, yeah.

342
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,900
 No, exactly.

343
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,200
 They're staying in the public eye.

344
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,900
 They're staying out there.

345
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,900
 The only thing that I fear, Matt, and I had this exact same thought today,

346
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,300
 even regarding our little platform, is that--

347
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,600
 Again, we cannot afford to lose the 50, sometimes $65 we make off of our network every month.

348
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,000
 But the thing is, the trouble is, it's who controls the pipes.

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,300
 That's what it comes down to.

350
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,700
 Yes.

351
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,300
 Who controls the pipes.

352
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:17,300
 And right now, Mario, right now, YouTube is kind of the thing, but that's Google.

353
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:24,200
 So what else has that-- I mean, nothing else has that large of an appeal.

354
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,500
 And YouTube's been weird the last couple of months.

355
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:35,900
 So I don't fucking-- what platform do they go to next where the pipes aren't already rigged?

356
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,400
 Is there something?

357
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,900
 Vinyl.

358
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,800
 You might be right, Jacob.

359
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,100
 You might be right.

360
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,900
 Just going to be shipping vinyl.

361
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,300
 Man, I mean, it could be mixed tapes.

362
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,400
 We might be sharing mixed tapes on the corner before this is all over.

363
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,900
 Physical media is exactly right.

364
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,400
 It's all coming back dramatically.

365
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
 Thirsty's right.

366
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
 That's why I got my stack of movies over here.

367
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400
 And I'm like, I'm so glad that I've got all the physical media.

368
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,000
 I'm so sad I got rid of my CDs.

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,800
 It's true.

370
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,700
 It's crazy.

371
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,500
 You know, the plot of every second Godzilla movie is like another monster,

372
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
 and they fight each other, right?

373
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,400
 So yeah, YouTube is a little cuckoo.

374
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,800
 And can you imagine the FCC trying to come for YouTube and what that would happen?

375
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,300
 No.

376
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,500
 I really-- here's the thing.

377
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,000
 If you want to talk about one of the failings--

378
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,200
 We probably won't have to imagine it for too long.

379
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,700
 Well, the thing is, if you want to look at the failings of--

380
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,900
 I really think that Joe Biden and Trump and who was president before that?

381
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,400
 Trump and then before that, Obama.

382
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,500
 Obama, yeah.

383
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,800
 None of these people, I think, really, truly fathomed the amount of money

384
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,900
 and world influence that these companies truly have.

385
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,400
 Yeah.

386
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,900
 No.

387
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,700
 I think they have.

388
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,500
 When Facebook started, when Amazon started, when these companies started up,

389
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,100
 and even before COVID.

390
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,400
 I mean, as recently as before COVID, I don't think anyone, including us,

391
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:08,600
 probably, had any real grasp on the extent of the influence that

392
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,200
 was going to be part of these platforms.

393
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
 Yeah.

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,100
 I mean, yeah.

395
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:20,100
 I'm just saying that, like, Apple invests $50 billion in a year

396
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:30,700
 in job training and facilitating every aspect of their company in China.

397
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,700
 And then they show up at the White House with a million-dollar bribe

398
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,100
 for the president, right?

399
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,600
 Right.

400
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,500
 And $50 billion to $1 million, it's not hard to figure out

401
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,600
 the scale of what's worth distracting the president with shiny things for.

402
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,900
 Yeah.

403
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,300
 I mean, so it'll be interesting.

404
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,800
 I don't think YouTube is like the--

405
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,500
 I don't think there's a great answer.

406
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,300
 I don't think it's a Shangri-La area for unfiltered speech.

407
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,600
 Because part of what annoys us is that part of total freedom

408
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,200
 is conspiracy theorists can say whatever they want.

409
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,700
 Right.

410
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,200
 Of course.

411
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,800
 And so part of the cesspool of where we're at is also part of the total freedom

412
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,100
 that we actually have.

413
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,400
 So it's really-- it's so complicated.

414
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,600
 I think you just have to be--

415
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,000
 I honestly think you have to spend more time with faces of actual people,

416
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
 I think is what actually has to happen.

417
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,200
 That's honestly what I'm trying to do by having these free classes

418
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,200
 and getting into teaching again is just to be face-to-face with human beings

419
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,000
 once more.

420
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,200
 It seems like that was the hugely obvious lesson that came from COVID.

421
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,300
 Yeah, and none of us learned it.

422
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,200
 No.

423
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,600
 It was like, hey, boy, did we all go fucking crazy when we had to be by ourselves

424
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,800
 and locked down in our houses.

425
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
 Boy, did we all go fucking nuts.

426
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
 And then we go, you know the answer to that?

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,800
 What if you talk to a computer instead of a person?

428
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
 And I was like, great, let's invest billions in that.

429
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,200
 I was like, didn't we--

430
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,800
 it's like, oh, you know, chat TBT is taking over therapy.

431
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,600
 Good?

432
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,400
 Like, wait, didn't we learn to talk to a human?

433
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,800
 Like, at all?

434
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 So I don't know.

435
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,200
 And again, this is the most kind of high horsey we get on this show.

436
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
 And I don't want to get to whatever.

437
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,400
 And I'll try to find some funny story to divert from in a moment here.

438
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,000
 Real quick--

439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
 It's a lot right now.

440
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,600
 Yeah.

441
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
 Yeah, it is a lot right now.

442
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,400
 Real quick--

443
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
 We're all going through a lot.

444
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,800
 And it is--

445
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,200
 Yeah, go ahead.

446
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,600
 Oh, sorry, Paul.

447
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,000
 Go ahead.

448
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,200
 Go ahead.

449
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,000
 No, finish--

450
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
 Oh, no, I was just going to piggyback on what Matt

451
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 said earlier.

452
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 It is-- it is frustrating for us.

453
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 It's frustrating for the three of us because we do have a platform.

454
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,600
 And we do have lots of opinions.

455
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
 But it's simply not what this show is.

456
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,600
 And it's not what we've built this show to be.

457
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 And it's not what the Scoops have built this show to be.

458
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
 Nor should it be.

459
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
 We still got to have some escapist entertainment.

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
 And that's what we're going to keep providing.

461
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,400
 But I do think it is important from time to time

462
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,600
 to let people know, hey, shit's weird.

463
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
 We love you.

464
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
 Hang tight.

465
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,200
 We've got your backs.

466
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
 You know what side of the fence we're on?

467
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
 Also, I really think--

468
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,800
 we do have a lot of listeners who aren't in our country.

469
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,400
 And I think they don't know how our television system works

470
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,600
 with a network--

471
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 Or doesn't, yeah.

472
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 --networks and affiliates and that kind of stuff.

473
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,800
 And so I think that's what makes this Kimmel situation so

474
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,600
 galvanizing and untenable.

475
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,400
 Oh, the Kimmel thing, I was actually getting to Absinthe.

476
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,600
 It broke on the New York Times that Kimmel--

477
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 all of it had happened--

478
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
 as I was parking at Caesar's Palace.

479
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,800
 So as I'm walking into Caesar's, all I was doing

480
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,200
 was searching YouTube for the monologue,

481
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,600
 for the offending monologue from Jimmy Kimmel.

482
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,100
 And I found it, and I watched it,

483
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
 and I thought I had found the wrong thing.

484
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,300
 Yep.

485
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,300
 Because there's not even that moment of like, ooh,

486
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,000
 in the audience when he says anything.

487
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,500
 No.

488
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,400
 Because he doesn't say anything.

489
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
 Because there's no ooh.

490
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,600
 No.

491
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 There's no there, there.

492
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,200
 Is there anything critical of Charlie Kirk in that monologue?

493
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,300
 Absolutely not.

494
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,600
 The most terrifying thing about all of this--

495
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
 and it goes back to what we were talking about,

496
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
 about trans rights--

497
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,800
 is that the attempt here is to label any modicum of dissent.

498
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,600
 Anything.

499
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,200
 Anything.

500
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
 Doesn't have to be dissent.

501
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,200
 Just to label anything as wrong.

502
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,700
 Right.

503
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,200
 And then you can just be-- and they're

504
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,000
 trying to push it to where you can just be blown up.

505
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,500
 Yeah.

506
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,200
 Oh, yeah, that doesn't look quite right.

507
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,700
 Kaboom.

508
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,300
 Yeah.

509
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,200
 I mean, that's what we're looking

510
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,600
 at some bills in current legislation right now that

511
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 are trying to ratify, like, given certain individuals,

512
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
 like, 007 license to kill shit.

513
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,500
 It's like, yeah, pump the fucking brakes here, guys.

514
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,200
 And also you have, like, government officials

515
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
 encouraging other government officials

516
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,000
 and their constituents to--

517
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,200
 you know, if you see someone post something negative

518
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 about Charlie Kirk, call their employer.

519
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
 Hey, work straight up.

520
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 You know, try to get them fired from their job that doesn't

521
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
 have anything to do with what we're talking about.

522
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,400
 In Nevada, in Las Vegas County, Clark County,

523
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,200
 teachers have been unassigned classrooms

524
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
 because of their social media posts.

525
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,200
 And we already have an extreme teacher shortage here.

526
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,000
 We have an extreme teacher shortage here,

527
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
 and we're kicking teachers out of classrooms

528
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
 because of social media posts now.

529
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,200
 And that, too, is part of the plan, I believe, Jacob.

530
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,000
 Oh, no.

531
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,200
 I think you're absolutely wrong.

532
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,800
 Which is grotesque in and of itself, too.

533
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,400
 It's like, any excuse--

534
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
 I don't think that's a quiet plan.

535
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,200
 I don't think that's a plan that anybody is being coy about.

536
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,500
 I think they're just saying it out loud.

537
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,000
 Yeah, like, well, we're going to get rid of all public education.

538
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,500
 You know me in the conspiracy theories.

539
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,800
 I criticize you on the conspiracy theories.

540
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,100
 It's not a theory when they're saying this is what we're doing.

541
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,700
 Exactly.

542
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,400
 No, things are getting--

543
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,200
 And Paul--

544
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,600
 Yeah?

545
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
 I know you hate your man Jimmy Fallon.

546
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 I know you hate him.

547
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,700
 He stepped up to the plate last night.

548
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,600
 He did.

549
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
 He stepped up to the plate last night.

550
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,900
 But, you know--

551
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,600
 I mean, he's got to figure that his days are numbered, right?

552
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,200
 Well, but--

553
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
 OK, so here's the--

554
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,400
 I'll never forgive him for that hair-tossle moment.

555
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,900
 No, no.

556
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,600
 I know, I know, I know.

557
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,400
 But, I mean, right now, Fallon has to figure that he's not

558
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,300
 going to be on the air for months.

559
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
 Who the fuck knows?

560
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,200
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

561
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,900
 This is what everyone needs to understand.

562
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,800
 This is what everyone--

563
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,100
 this is what I mean by, like, the shitty reporting, OK?

564
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,400
 Even when Colbert went on the Emmys

565
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,400
 and said, hey, I have 200 people in the back that could use

566
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
 some work if you're hiring, right?

567
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,600
 And that joke came out, OK?

568
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,400
 If he said that five years ago, the number would have been 300.

569
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,900
 OK?

570
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,400
 Yeah.

571
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
 That's how much-- that's the average--

572
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 that was the average workforce of a show like that.

573
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,200
 Network television is dying.

574
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,800
 Yeah.

575
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,300
 Yeah.

576
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,700
 And late night shows are expensive to produce, right?

577
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,400
 And so if you're the CEO of a company that

578
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,800
 is publicly traded, would you rather be left--

579
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,200
 be the one CEO actually holding the bag when it finally dies?

580
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,600
 Or would you like to say, oh, the president's an asshole,

581
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,900
 I guess we've got to go along with what he says?

582
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,400
 Yeah.

583
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,100
 Yeah.

584
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,500
 And so this is what's happening.

585
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,800
 These networks are ducking out on these shows.

586
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,700
 It is convenient for them to do so.

587
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,200
 Sure.

588
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
 It is nice for them to say, oh, sorry, what are you

589
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,400
 going to do, political pressure.

590
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,200
 Yeah, right.

591
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,600
 Because paying-- even these lawsuits, paying him $15 million

592
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,200
 is still cheaper than keeping these things going.

593
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,600
 So yes, as long as NBC wants to fight the fight,

594
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,300
 it'll be going along with it.

595
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,800
 But the Colbert report went off air

596
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,500
 because that show was going to get killed no matter what.

597
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,400
 That was behind the scenes that was going to die.

598
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,200
 And right around that time, according to the union rules,

599
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,400
 they have to negotiate with the producers.

600
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,900
 And they basically had to tell them

601
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,300
 what their new deal was going to be.

602
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,100
 And they were basically going like, oh, well,

603
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,400
 if we have to tell them we're not

604
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,100
 going to renegotiate a new deal, then we basically

605
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,940
 are telling them they're going to go off air.

606
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,500
 We might as well tell them they're going to go off the air.

607
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,800
 You're talking about the new Colbert late night show,

608
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,600
 not Colbert report.

609
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,100
 Yes.

610
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,500
 No, no, no.

611
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,000
 I'm sorry, Colbert late night show.

612
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
 Yeah, yeah, the most recent.

613
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,540
 But the news broke.

614
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,500
 And then people were going to take credit

615
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,400
 as if it was because he was criticizing Trump

616
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,800
 that that was happening.

617
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,000
 Right.

618
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,100
 And Paramount was still trying to get their merger approved.

619
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,900
 So they had no problem saying, oh, yep,

620
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,200
 the president did do that.

621
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,500
 Because it's going to help them get their merger approved.

622
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,900
 But they were eliminating that show as a cost cutting measure

623
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,700
 to get the merger finances to line up anyway.

624
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,200
 Right.

625
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
 That show was going away no matter what.

626
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,900
 Yeah, yeah.

627
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,600
 So--

628
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,400
 That's all weird.

629
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
 The stockholder thing stuff is just so weird.

630
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,500
 Basically, these are all--

631
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,800
 the reason why I feel like we're taking crazy pills

632
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,900
 is because the behemoths of media that we grew up with

633
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,700
 are dying.

634
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,400
 And so they don't have the fight to fight.

635
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,900
 They don't--

636
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,300
 Yeah, they don't have that clout anymore.

637
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,700
 They don't have-- there's nowhere--

638
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,400
 they don't have the standing to fight like they used to.

639
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,500
 And so this is all just political advantageism

640
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,200
 taking advantage of something that's dying.

641
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
 Basically, kicking something while it's dying.

642
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,400
 They're putting these odd nepo baby figureheads

643
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
 in charge of these megacorporations

644
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,040
 that have no experience in running the industry

645
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,660
 and no experience in the industry

646
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,800
 that they're now helming to just oversee the death of them.

647
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,400
 And they're doing the same thing that they did to Toys R' Us

648
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,200
 just on larger entertainment venues.

649
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,480
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

650
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,600
 NBC, ABC, CBS, the big three are Toys R' Us.

651
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,800
 Yeah.

652
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,300
 Yeah.

653
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,700
 And they're getting-- they're getting sold off for parts

654
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,900
 before we know it.

655
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,400
 Yeah.

656
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,040
 Yeah, it's a shame.

657
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,840
 I just want to say real quick.

658
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,200
 So all right, are we fairly done with that?

659
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,440
 I mean, for the most part, thank you, Scoops,

660
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,960
 for listening to us prattle on.

661
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,400
 But we felt it was important to say.

662
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,360
 But I do have a little thing on this.

663
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,860
 So--

664
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,680
 Bring us to a close, and then we'll do a sponsor.

665
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
 We'll do a sponsor spot.

666
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,640
 And scene.

667
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,400
 This is tangential.

668
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,360
 This is a different thing I wanted to talk about.

669
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
 Oh, yeah, great, great.

670
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,860
 Yeah.

671
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,640
 Yeah, do it.

672
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,980
 You want to do sponsor first?

673
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,120
 I thought you said sponsor.

674
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,760
 Great.

675
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,200
 Following sponsor.

676
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,960
 This is why we shouldn't stop making poop jokes.

677
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,640
 Our show falls apart.

678
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,680
 We're bad at not making poop jokes.

679
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
 It does.

680
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,800
 We don't know how to get out of it.

681
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,280
 By the way, Jeffrey was the name of the giraffe in Toys R' Us.

682
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,160
 Jeffrey Epstein, coincidence?

683
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,280
 No.

684
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,440
 Probably.

685
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,720
 Today's show is brought to you by Paul's Football Quarter,

686
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,260
 a new sports ball podcast.

687
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,720
 [HUMMING]

688
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:53,760
 Hey there, sports fans.

689
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
 Paul Mattingly here with the latest and greatest

690
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,200
 from not watching a goddamn thing that NFL's doing

691
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,240
 this whole goddamn season.

692
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,440
 I've heard that some football teams have actually

693
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,600
 played some games.

694
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,040
 And I did catch through my cursory browsing

695
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
 of social media that one Joe Burrow,

696
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,640
 hope and heart of the Cincinnati Bengals,

697
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,520
 has broken his toe, and he won't be

698
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,320
 able to play games for another three months.

699
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,960
 Just one more example of the idiocy and horrible violence

700
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,240
 contained within this shit game.

701
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,120
 That's right.

702
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,360
 A player whose designation as quarterback

703
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,420
 keeps him from the most hits and hurts

704
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,960
 has actually become so injured he can't play for three months

705
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,000
 just from somebody landing on his foot.

706
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,960
 That sounds pretty gross to me.

707
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,040
 Now, back to you, Dick.

708
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,440
 Enter Hayscoops to check out.

709
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
 There's no Dick, Paul.

710
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,760
 It's just your own podcast.

711
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,880
 I am Dick.

712
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,040
 I am also Dick.

713
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,080
 I just didn't get a chance to respond.

714
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,580
 Oh, sorry.

715
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,800
 Go ahead, Dick.

716
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,680
 Thanks.

717
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,480
 Thanks, Beer.

718
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,680
 Beer and Dick are the two hosts of my podcast on sports.

719
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,080
 Thank you, Beer.

720
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,980
 I'd like to also say, screw everything about the NFL.

721
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,400
 It's a violent horror show, and no one

722
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
 should be involved in it.

723
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,360
 Good night.

724
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,000
 Good night.

725
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,440
 Good night.

726
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,760
 Local politics say a Nevada state senator

727
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,440
 was arrested last night.

728
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,600
 He was found unconscious in his car at a stoplight

729
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,400
 in the driver's seat.

730
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,160
 The video is just a cop going up and knocking on his window

731
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,920
 and be like, put your car in park.

732
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,480
 Oh, my god.

733
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,520
 Put it in park.

734
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,000
 That's how it starts.

735
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,040
 Oh, my god.

736
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,240
 He says he was not inebriated in any way, to which I respond,

737
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,480
 then, sir, you have a medical condition.

738
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,560
 You need to go to the doctor.

739
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,480
 Alcohol is not the only thing that can impair your driving.

740
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,600
 Right.

741
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,760
 Whatever this is, it's an issue that you

742
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
 need to get it taken care of.

743
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,800
 I think you're just drunk, though.

744
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,680
 Holy simoleons.

745
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,080
 What were you going to say, Paul?

746
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,160
 All right, so the other day, Anne and I

747
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,320
 went chair shopping, right?

748
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,000
 All right.

749
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,080
 And she got her chair.

750
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,360
 It's delivered, and she loves it.

751
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,120
 This is her new reading chair.

752
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,480
 It is a transformative thing for her.

753
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,360
 It's wonderful.

754
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,160
 She takes naps in it now.

755
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,680
 It's got the massage and the heat,

756
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,560
 so she's really enjoying herself.

757
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,120
 It's great.

758
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,320
 So I'm so happy that the chair is a success,

759
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,200
 and it's in the house.

760
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,480
 But while we were heading for the chair,

761
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,880
 we were discussing my very soon flights out

762
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
 to Vegas and everything.

763
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:44,080
 And she's like, two of the last three times I've been to Vegas,

764
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,440
 I've come back with COVID.

765
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,080
 That's just facts.

766
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,760
 I should say two of the last five times, I guess.

767
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,440
 I think it tricks out pretty good.

768
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,320
 But she's a little concerned.

769
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,280
 And I am, too, because I don't want that shit anymore.

770
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,760
 So we're like, let's try and see if we can get a COVID shot.

771
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,600
 Because I don't know how it's been for you guys,

772
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,320
 but it's not easy out here.

773
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,840
 We went and got our flu shots at our local Walmart,

774
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,640
 which is our close spot we use for our pharmacy that's

775
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,880
 got our insurance.

776
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,760
 So we got our flu shots three weeks ago, four weeks ago,

777
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,320
 and they just didn't have the COVID shot yet.

778
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,600
 And they didn't know when they were going to get it.

779
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,440
 They were hoping October, but that would do me no good,

780
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,680
 because I was traveling before that.

781
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,360
 So we're sitting in the parking lot of this furniture spot,

782
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,160
 and my wife's like, well, let's try and get this going for you,

783
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,040
 at least, so that you have some level of protection

784
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,280
 when you're traveling.

785
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,640
 And I said, that's a good idea.

786
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,280
 I'm all for it.

787
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,520
 OK, I'll call my PCP, right?

788
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,920
 So I call my primary care physician,

789
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,320
 and I get a dude on the line.

790
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,160
 Oh, that's what you meant by PCP.

791
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,440
 I called my PCP, not my--

792
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,760
 But you were calling your dealer.

793
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,320
 Not my METH.

794
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
 You got my PCP?

795
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,280
 Yeah!

796
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,080
 So I called my METH, and I got a hold of my PCP instead.

797
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,760
 No, but the person on the other line says,

798
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,600
 I'm not sure what the status is for COVID shots.

799
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,080
 I'll put you in touch with our other nurse practitioners,

800
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,000
 whatever.

801
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,840
 I'm on hold for a good three or four minutes,

802
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,760
 and I'm just getting to a point where I'm like,

803
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,720
 well, this is just silly.

804
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,200
 And then somebody finally picks up, and they say hello.

805
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,080
 And I said, hi.

806
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,000
 I was just calling about the availability of COVID shots.

807
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,880
 And this lady says, we don't know when or if we're

808
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,840
 going to receive any.

809
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,400
 And this is the medical facility right down the street from me.

810
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,280
 It's midway between a hospital and a rehab center, whatever.

811
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,640
 But I've gone there for a lot of stuff.

812
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,080
 I go there for my general practitioner,

813
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,680
 all that kind of thing.

814
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,560
 And your PCP.

815
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
 And my PCP.

816
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,480
 So I'm like, OK, yikes.

817
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,760
 I don't know when or if.

818
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,440
 So I was just like, well, shit, that's not good at all.

819
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,360
 And that seems to be the case in a lot of places out here.

820
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,360
 And even Anne's sister, who works as a nurse,

821
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,520
 they're having emergency meetings

822
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,120
 to try and discuss what the plan is moving forward

823
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,320
 for the distribution of the shots.

824
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,840
 So we're getting pretty nervous.

825
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,560
 We're like, ah, but we're driving down the street.

826
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,160
 What, three days ago, four days ago?

827
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,440
 And Anne looks over and she sees at the CVS,

828
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,560
 it says flu shots, COVID shots.

829
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,960
 And--

830
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,200
 Pulls right in, drives over the--

831
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,160
 We did.

832
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,760
 We straight up turned around.

833
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,560
 We straight up turned around and went in.

834
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,040
 We're like, fuck it, they don't take our insurance normally.

835
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,680
 But let's give it a shot.

836
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,640
 Let's give it a shot.

837
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,960
 So we went in there and we go in and said,

838
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,360
 you guys got the COVID boosters.

839
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,280
 We'd like to get those.

840
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,040
 And they said, well, it's 65 and up,

841
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,880
 or you have to self-attest that you're in a risk thing.

842
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,840
 And I'm like, oh, I'll self-attest.

843
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,800
 Yeah, self-attest.

844
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,640
 Yeah, I self-attest.

845
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
 Let's go.

846
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,720
 And then another lady who was really nice, she's like,

847
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,440
 let me see your insurance cards.

848
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,080
 And so we gave her our insurance cards.

849
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,480
 And sure enough, she was able to do some finagling on there

850
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,960
 that we got these covered.

851
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,080
 And we both got our COVID shots.

852
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,720
 Eat shit, RFK Junior.

853
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,240
 I mean, well, seriously, it might kill that brain worm.

854
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,400
 Who the fuck knows when the next time is going to be available?

855
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,520
 But I'm grateful that I got that when I did.

856
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,640
 Now I can go into Scoop Fest feeling a little better

857
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,120
 protected, not just for Scoop Fest, just for being in Vegas.

858
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,960
 While I'm here, do you have any medical grade cocaine locked

859
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,720
 up back there?

860
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,640
 For real, right?

861
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,280
 I can attest to all kinds of stuff.

862
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,120
 I'm pretty sure--

863
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,760
 I will attest to so much.

864
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,680
 I'm pretty sure that that's recommended now

865
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,360
 by the FDC chair.

866
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,440
 They say that's pretty good for your mental health,

867
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,400
 is just a straight up cocaine crack and heroin.

868
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,040
 Yeah, it's fucking insanity times.

869
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,440
 But I thought it was kind of crazy.

870
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,360
 But I'm very grateful that Ann spotted that.

871
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,160
 And we swung around and went for it and actually got it.

872
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:33,840
 Poor thing hurt.

873
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,240
 She's got a reaction on her arm.

874
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,720
 And really going through it, feeling kind of lethargic.

875
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,640
 I had almost nothing happen this time.

876
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:49,760
 But I think she's only had COVID once, maybe.

877
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,880
 I've gone through it at least two times.

878
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,080
 And that second time, I couldn't smell or taste

879
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,840
 for a little bit.

880
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,120
 So I got it pretty bad that second time.

881
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,160
 Man, oh, man.

882
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,720
 Just grateful to have that done.

883
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,320
 Just crazy.

884
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,840
 But how weird that it's getting to got a fucking pinball around

885
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,040
 to try and find what should be readily available.

886
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,280
 I don't understand.

887
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,840
 Liz Warren hammered RFK Jr. in front of Congress about it.

888
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,520
 He purposely changed up all the programs.

889
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,680
 And the person they fired, she's testifying

890
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,440
 that he's making all these policies

891
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,560
 without any scientific basis and ignoring

892
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,280
 the scientific recommendations of qualified people.

893
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,840
 And he's also just crazy, crazy unqualified for his job

894
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,560
 that should never have been approved.

895
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,040
 He's just really in abomination that that fucking asshole--

896
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,200
 It's a travesty.

897
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,120
 He's oddly unqualified.

898
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,480
 Yeah.

899
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,600
 And all of these, quote unquote, middle of the road,

900
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,680
 on the fence, people voted him in.

901
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,360
 And it's just like, regardless of his hearing,

902
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,760
 he just simply wasn't--

903
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,840
 There's nothing on the resume that you put that person

904
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
 in that job.

905
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,560
 No.

906
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,080
 It's like hiring a three-year-old

907
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,960
 to be a garbage truck driver.

908
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,720
 It's like, what the fuck are you doing?

909
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,480
 No.

910
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,760
 It's not going to work.

911
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
 It is bizarre.

912
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,200
 It is bizarre.

913
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,800
 But I'm glad you did, Paul.

914
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,560
 I am about to--

915
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,960
 right after Scoot Fest, I've got to fly out to Canada,

916
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,160
 where I may never come back.

917
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,200
 The day after.

918
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,000
 Yeah, I'm going to be joining the Enchanted Princess.

919
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,920
 Ooh.

920
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,560
 That's right.

921
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,120
 I will go from the Enchanted Princess

922
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,440
 to the Brilliant Lady.

923
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,920
 Brilliant Lady!

924
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,280
 Oh, Brilliant Lady!

925
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,320
 All I do is show my age.

926
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,640
 Are these boats?

927
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,040
 Princess--

928
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,000
 These aren't boats, Paul.

929
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,680
 These are people.

930
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,600
 I am required to give oral sex to two different women

931
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,760
 in Canada.

932
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,680
 Fair.

933
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,000
 Yeah.

934
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,240
 It's a contractual thing.

935
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,600
 It's just the thing.

936
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,480
 Now, entertainment, what are you going to do?

937
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,080
 I'm with it.

938
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,840
 No.

939
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,320
 The Enchanted Princesses is--

940
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,440
 princess ships always have the name of the ship

941
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,760
 before the word "princess."

942
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,960
 So the Enchanted Princess is a princess ship.

943
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,520
 And then the very new ship, the Brilliant Lady,

944
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,320
 is the name of the new Virgin America ship.

945
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,480
 Not anymore.

946
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,520
 But what happens is they--

947
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,680
 my travel is booked by these large corporations that

948
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,560
 move 1,000 guest entertainers across hundreds of ships

949
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,960
 all over the world.

950
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,240
 And so I often have to get my travel sign

951
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,280
 and then try to hop on and get myself

952
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,520
 not the most uncomfortable seat in an airplane, right?

953
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,840
 And so--

954
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,280
 Because they booked you in the lavatory or something?

955
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,000
 They booked me where the seat will be assigned a gate.

956
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,520
 Yes.

957
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,400
 Right.

958
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,840
 And so I've not flown Air Canada before.

959
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,200
 Oh.

960
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,840
 And so these flights are on Air Canada.

961
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,880
 And so I had to basically get myself an Air Canada account,

962
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,920
 load up my passport, all this stuff.

963
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,680
 And then I go, great.

964
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,360
 To get the account, do you have to--

965
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,200
 instead of checking to see if you're a robot,

966
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,720
 do they check to make you describe

967
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,520
 the flavor of poutine or something?

968
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,480
 How do they do that?

969
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,960
 Yeah, they do a lot of poutine.

970
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,040
 It's a huge poutine questionnaire.

971
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,000
 Yeah, that's what I figured.

972
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,500
 OK.

973
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:26,120
 We get in, and then they say, pronounce S-O-R-R-Y.

974
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,400
 And then you have to--

975
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,680
 it's a really tricky--

976
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,240
 And then you're like, trick question.

977
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
 You should have been saying it this whole time.

978
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
 [LAUGHTER]

979
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,560
 If you haven't been apologizing this whole time,

980
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,400
 I'm sorry.

981
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,360
 See yourself out.

982
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,400
 Yeah.

983
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,360
 So I go to select an aisle seat on my two flights.

984
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,240
 And then I go to correct it.

985
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,080
 And it says, you cannot process.

986
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,240
 I'm going, oh, weird.

987
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,280
 Because metric, right?

988
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,680
 And then I look online, and it says,

989
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,640
 if you bought your flight through a third party service,

990
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
 you can't upgrade your seat on an Air Canada flight.

991
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,840
 You have to fly directly from Air Canada

992
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,880
 to upgrade your seats.

993
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,000
 And I go, that can't be right.

994
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,800
 And I have the app.

995
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,760
 And so I'm there at the app.

996
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,520
 And it's like, aisle seat for flight number 1, $40.

997
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,000
 Yeah.

998
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,960
 Aisle flight for flight number 2, another 20 bucks.

999
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,080
 And then I click Next Screen.

1000
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,120
 And it says, total cost, $8,945.

1001
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,120
 [WHISTLE]

1002
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,060
 [LAUGHTER]

1003
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,800
 What happened?

1004
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,880
 Jesus.

1005
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,280
 And it says, view price summary.

1006
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,840
 And I was like, you bet your ass

1007
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,040
 I want to view that price summary.

1008
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,960
 Hold on now.

1009
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,360
 Let me just pull up my own calculator here.

1010
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,920
 If we want to get the aisle seat here.

1011
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,040
 [WHISTLE]

1012
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,280
 $40, yep.

1013
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,280
 [WHISTLE]

1014
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
 $20.

1015
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,760
 [WHISTLE]

1016
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,800
 And then it adds up to $8,945.

1017
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,320
 Wow.

1018
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,800
 [WHISTLE]

1019
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
 Oh, yep, yep.

1020
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,360
 That checks out.

1021
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,200
 So I told my wife, I said, sorry I'm losing money this month

1022
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,520
 by going away for three weeks.

1023
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,880
 But I really need my foot room, you know?

1024
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,480
 [LAUGHTER]

1025
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,080
 Not just a little bit of money, either.

1026
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,160
 So then I realized--

1027
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,640
 It's a good thing these ships pay Matt $35,000 a week.

1028
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,880
 I'm trying on the laptop, I'm trying on my phone,

1029
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,840
 I'm trying on regular websites, I'm trying on the app.

1030
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,160
 I'm trying to figure out what the hell's going on.

1031
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,800
 I try to call--

1032
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,200
 Oh, CanadianScoopCrystal in the chat

1033
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,400
 wants to know if it's just the exchange rate.

1034
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1035
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,560
 $8,900.

1036
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,320
 Was it from $42 US, $8,000 Canadian?

1037
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,760
 Heavy loony-toony turnover there.

1038
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,440
 Things have gotten rough.

1039
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,360
 Yeah.

1040
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,880
 And so for whatever reason, I go back to the steps.

1041
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,560
 And I realize I go, oh, have you tried an e-upgrade

1042
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,560
 or something like that?

1043
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,560
 And I click on that.

1044
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,520
 And it allows you to bid on a higher seat.

1045
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,400
 I have seen this, yes.

1046
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,040
 So this is why they don't let you

1047
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,880
 pay for your seat or upgrade from a third-party site.

1048
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
 They're basically like, oh, did you

1049
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,600
 fuck yourself at a third-party site?

1050
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
 Come into the auction house.

1051
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1052
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,880
 Join your friends here.

1053
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:36,600
 And the minimum bid is between $40 and $8,000.

1054
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,080
 $7,900.

1055
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,520
 Who's buying an $8,000 plane ticket?

1056
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,400
 I think it's just a weird error.

1057
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,360
 I don't think that's actually meant for someone

1058
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,120
 to actually--

1059
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,600
 Like, even if I was making $35 grand for a gig,

1060
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,680
 $8,000 ticket, that takes a bite.

1061
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,320
 No, no, it's got to be like-- they just put it as that

1062
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,960
 so that you won't change it through that part of the site.

1063
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,360
 So you go to the auction, right?

1064
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,160
 That's it.

1065
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,640
 Yeah.

1066
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,640
 OK, yeah.

1067
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,320
 Weird.

1068
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,720
 They're like, if you want to pay $8,000,

1069
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,520
 we'll just let you pay $8,000.

1070
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,040
 But we'd really rather you just go to the auction site.

1071
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,160
 Andy Cheek, the escape to Canada rate

1072
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,920
 has increased lately for some reason.

1073
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1074
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,200
 I mean, honestly, if Air Canada just shot their rates up,

1075
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,400
 US to Canada flights--

1076
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,800
 Market demand.

1077
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,720
 Market demand.

1078
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,760
 That's what it is, baby.

1079
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,880
 That's capitalism at work.

1080
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,440
 What is it, dynamic pricing?

1081
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,320
 It's dynamic pricing.

1082
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,520
 Dynamic pricing.

1083
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,000
 Dynamic pricing.

1084
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,600
 God damn it.

1085
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,200
 I'll tell you who else uses a lot of dynamic pricing

1086
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,760
 for their international flights.

1087
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,640
 But that's the following sponsor.

1088
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,280
 Today's show is brought to you by--

1089
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,120
 it's the creepy guy who used to host pick-up artist seminars,

1090
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,840
 but definitely not safe or FDA-approved,

1091
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,000
 air quotes, "brain pills," as seen on the Joe Rogan

1092
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,200
 experience.

1093
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,160
 The creepy guy who used to host pick-up seminars,

1094
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,840
 definitely not safe, FDA-approved,

1095
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,000
 air quotes, "brain pills."

1096
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,640
 Hey, you guys looking to expand your mind a little bit?

1097
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,800
 Yeah?

1098
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,120
 OK, let's do it.

1099
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,760
 So you see my crazy hat, right?

1100
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,320
 I got a big crazy hat on, peacocking with my crazy hat.

1101
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,000
 Well, look right under this hat.

1102
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,960
 Look what you see.

1103
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,680
 You see a cranium full of ideas.

1104
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,680
 But all those ideas stay locked up in my brain.

1105
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,560
 Why?

1106
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,360
 Why?

1107
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,560
 Because I haven't been taking the right supplements, huh?

1108
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,480
 Supplements.

1109
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,360
 Just like you, baby, you're supple of mints.

1110
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,240
 You're smooth, and your breath is fresh.

1111
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,360
 Supple of mints.

1112
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,280
 I bet you say that to all the gals.

1113
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,320
 I do, in an attempt to get at least one of them to respond.

1114
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,520
 That's what it's all about.

1115
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,040
 It's a numbers game, pal.

1116
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,080
 You say it to every woman.

1117
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,520
 You say it to every single woman.

1118
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,760
 Thousands, in fact.

1119
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,680
 Yeah.

1120
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,880
 Supple of mints.

1121
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,600
 Supple of mints.

1122
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,240
 These supple of mints are perfect.

1123
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,680
 They got a drop of Retson, which is still OK so far.

1124
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,120
 No links to anything yet.

1125
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,000
 But these will open up your brain.

1126
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,560
 Oh, what's that you say?

1127
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,040
 You like my dolphin chain?

1128
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,320
 Yeah, check it out.

1129
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,680
 I'm wearing a dolphin on a chain.

1130
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,280
 You know why?

1131
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:27,800
 Dolphins utilize a certain evolutionary device

1132
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,600
 called echolocation.

1133
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,720
 They send out these little squeaks and squawks.

1134
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,600
 And whatever that hits comes back to them.

1135
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,120
 And they can recognize where in space they are.

1136
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,280
 It allows them for three-dimensional orientation,

1137
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,280
 even in a place like the ocean, where it's

1138
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,760
 pretty easy to get turned around.

1139
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,440
 Oh, man.

1140
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,080
 I don't follow.

1141
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,560
 But it's probably because I haven't taken brain pills.

1142
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,080
 That's right, sweet baby.

1143
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,800
 So go ahead and sip on some of this--

1144
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,240
 I bet you call all the gals sweet baby.

1145
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,920
 I call them all sweet baby.

1146
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,320
 Take some of this from my drink that you

1147
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,600
 haven't been watching closely for the last 10 minutes.

1148
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,840
 Oh, no.

1149
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,000
 Go ahead and have a drink.

1150
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,280
 Welcome to the red roofie inn, sweetheart.

1151
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,720
 Get our aid scoops and check out--

1152
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,800
 Get out and stay awhile.

1153
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,760
 These aren't brain pills.

1154
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,640
 They aren't?

1155
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,840
 That was from the gorilla dentist in that Bjork video

1156
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,560
 in 2024.

1157
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,200
 I love that name.

1158
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,720
 I fucking love that name.

1159
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,480
 But yeah, someone in chat talked about that they can

1160
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,600
 emigrate back to Newfoundland.

1161
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,920
 I'm actually going to St. John's, Newfoundland twice

1162
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,240
 on this three-week trip, once with the Enchanted Princess

1163
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,400
 and once with Virgin.

1164
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,640
 And I'm so excited.

1165
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,520
 I went there with Piff.

1166
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,600
 I loved Newfoundland so much.

1167
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,760
 It was so fun.

1168
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,120
 Newfoundland is where they have a lot of the puffins and stuff,

1169
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,760
 right?

1170
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,400
 Isn't that where people go to see puffins?

1171
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,080
 Yeah.

1172
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,520
 Are you able to consider yourself an honorary Newfie?

1173
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,520
 I don't think so.

1174
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,040
 Not yet?

1175
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,560
 I don't think so.

1176
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,040
 Got to have a couple more trips before you

1177
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,160
 can get Newfie standards.

1178
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,600
 I think you have to jump in naked into the water

1179
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,120
 and catch a fish with your mouth or something, right?

1180
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,080
 Ugh.

1181
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,920
 Here's the thing.

1182
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,160
 Which Matt's going to do this time.

1183
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,640
 I'm out.

1184
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,760
 Penn's ancestry comes from Newfoundland.

1185
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,600
 He loves the term Newfie.

1186
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,160
 And growing up, there was Newfie jokes, right?

1187
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,120
 Oh, really?

1188
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,120
 OK.

1189
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,160
 And so Paul, was this before you joined 50 Shades?

1190
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,640
 We had someone in the cast who was from Newfoundland.

1191
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,960
 Yeah, must have been before.

1192
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,600
 She was-- I won't name her, just to shout her up.

1193
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:42,600
 She was tall, thin soprano.

1194
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,080
 And it was always funny, because I love--

1195
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,920
 I thought 50 Shades was such a funny show.

1196
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,720
 And I loved that it ran in Vegas when it did.

1197
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,280
 And there's so many other shows that come here

1198
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,720
 that try to be funny that weren't,

1199
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,800
 that I was really happy about it.

1200
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,200
 It was a good show.

1201
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,760
 She was so ashamed to be in the show.

1202
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,360
 It was so obvious.

1203
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:00,800
 It was so funny.

1204
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,520
 Oh, my gosh.

1205
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,360
 It was so-- it was such a funny thing of--

1206
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,960
 Because of the content and whatnot?

1207
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,320
 Yes.

1208
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,800
 If she had any friends in the audience, or Pam, Pamela--

1209
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,640
 Oh, that's great.

1210
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,720
 Whatever.

1211
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,880
 She was so embarrassed that she was in the show.

1212
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,040
 That was really funny.

1213
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,200
 But I remember being like, you're from Newfoundland?

1214
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,400
 Yeah, I go, you're a Newfie?

1215
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,040
 And I watched her face kind of fall.

1216
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,600
 And then I--

1217
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,240
 Oh, no.

1218
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,000
 And then I still plowed ahead and said,

1219
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,400
 what's your favorite Newfie joke?

1220
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,880
 And she said, I don't have one.

1221
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,800
 And I was like, I've made a mistake.

1222
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,600
 Oh, boy.

1223
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,120
 I've made a mistake.

1224
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,960
 I've encountered the one unfunny Newfoundlander.

1225
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,480
 I have erred.

1226
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,520
 I thought we were going to--

1227
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,400
 I thought this was going one direction.

1228
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,440
 I was incorrect.

1229
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,240
 My brain said, I know I had it off with you.

1230
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,280
 And my brain was wrong, wrong, wrong.

1231
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,120
 Oh, boy.

1232
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,400
 It was the first time that Matt approached a woman

1233
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,040
 and said something that was wrong.

1234
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,200
 But not the last.

1235
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,080
 He's had a lot since then, though.

1236
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,520
 And then I called her supplements.

1237
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,880
 And then we called it a day.

1238
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,280
 It's a game of numbers, kids.

1239
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,480
 It's a game of numbers.

1240
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,360
 Game of numbers.

1241
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,960
 Speaking of games of numbers, you're about to lose this one.

1242
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
 It's Jock versus Nerd.

1243
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,120
 Oh, bring it, sucker.

1244
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:20,320
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1245
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,100
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1246
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:31,080
 Time for Jock versus Nerd.

1247
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:41,560
 It's explosion of Newfies.

1248
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,560
 We've got a Scoopity coming at us today from Keister Sunday.

1249
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,880
 It's all about movies.

1250
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,920
 We've got '80s comedies, '80s horror, '80s action,

1251
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,240
 and '80s sci-fi.

1252
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,600
 Paul, you're up first.

1253
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,080
 Oh, man.

1254
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,520
 I can't go wrong.

1255
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,060
 I'll go '80s sci-fi for 800.

1256
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,720
 I'm just going to shoot the moon, literally.

1257
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,000
 Whoa, look at him go.

1258
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,360
 And probably the best fantasy sci-fi adaptation of all time,

1259
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,760
 Dolph Lundgren and Billy Barty travel to Earth

1260
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,920
 to stop Frank Langella and Meg Foster from getting something

1261
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,400
 or destroying something or taking over something.

1262
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,920
 Also, Courtney Cox is in it.

1263
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,040
 Masters of the universe.

1264
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,200
 I even knew that one.

1265
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,720
 Masters of the universe.

1266
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,600
 So bad.

1267
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,560
 Oh, I love it.

1268
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,440
 It is fun-ish.

1269
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,360
 It's a fun one.

1270
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:24,860
 Oh, man.

1271
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,920
 Where can I go right?

1272
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,720
 Let's see here.

1273
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,280
 I'll do '80s action for 200.

1274
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,240
 And this violent satire, after being pumped full of more

1275
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,480
 rounds than your mother, the Megacorp OCP

1276
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,880
 crams what remains of Peter Weller back into a tin can

1277
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,520
 and pushes him back onto the streets to fight more crime

1278
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,040
 in the nightmare hellscape that is Detroit.

1279
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,460
 Casablanca.

1280
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,360
 Casablanca.

1281
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,440
 That is a remote--

1282
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,480
 You played it for her.

1283
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,760
 You can play it for me.

1284
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,580
 Creep.

1285
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:06,840
 Yes, it was Casablanca.

1286
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,800
 OK, good.

1287
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,280
 It's me.

1288
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,480
 I'll try '80s comedies.

1289
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,160
 200.

1290
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,960
 Of all the Jim Jones.

1291
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,280
 Known in the '80s mostly for playing streetwise cops

1292
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,000
 and detectives, this actor also played rags to riches,

1293
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,920
 orphan turned adopted son of a speakeasy proprietor,

1294
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,960
 and a rags to riches African prince.

1295
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,000
 Is this Eddie Murphy?

1296
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,560
 I think it is just Eddie Murphy, right?

1297
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,680
 I'm re-reading the question to make sure I read it right.

1298
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,600
 I think it's Eddie Murphy.

1299
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,400
 Eddie Murphy.

1300
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:33,900
 Yeah.

1301
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:38,720
 Charlie Murphy.

1302
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,840
 Full.

1303
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,640
 '80s sci-fi for 600, please.

1304
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,040
 It's going up the board.

1305
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,600
 In this 1981 Cronenberg classic, Michael Ironside

1306
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,320
 causes the greatest fucking head explosion

1307
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,560
 ever committed to celluloid.

1308
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,880
 Oh, that's scanners.

1309
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,480
 Scanners is correct.

1310
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,680
 At this point, that head explosion

1311
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,240
 is more famous than the movie.

1312
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:00,800
 Yeah, it is.

1313
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,600
 Definitely.

1314
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,200
 Oh, yeah.

1315
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,160
 I see that head explosion on so many clip shows and everything.

1316
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,200
 They never reference what it's from.

1317
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,440
 Yeah.

1318
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,360
 Matt.

1319
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,960
 Exploded like an Aldi hot dog says Latter-day Scoop.

1320
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,000
 Paul, did you get any physical Scoop Mail lately?

1321
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,360
 Not yet.

1322
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:18,920
 Oh, no.

1323
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,800
 OK.

1324
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,320
 It better come in the next three days.

1325
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,760
 I'm out of here for too long.

1326
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,360
 My wife's not going to know what to do with it.

1327
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,600
 If it's an Aldi hot dog, bleh.

1328
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,040
 I'm sure it's already been microwaved.

1329
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,480
 Matt, your turn.

1330
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,800
 '80s action 400, please.

1331
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,520
 In this prequel to Family Matters,

1332
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,960
 Carl Winslow assists that guy who

1333
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,280
 was shot by one of the new kids on the block

1334
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,320
 in stopping Snape from stealing Christmas or something.

1335
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,040
 I don't really remember much about that night.

1336
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,280
 Slurpee Kaye, motherfucker.

1337
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,360
 Slurpee Kaye, motherfucker.

1338
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,680
 Die hard.

1339
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,440
 Die hard.

1340
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,280
 Oh, man.

1341
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,640
 I'll try-- I don't know.

1342
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,320
 '80s action.

1343
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,440
 We're all staying away from '80s horror.

1344
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,400
 That's pretty funny.

1345
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,200
 Shit, Daily Double.

1346
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,200
 This prequel began the trend of including the main character's

1347
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,920
 name in the titles.

1348
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,040
 It's considered culturally insensitive

1349
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,240
 for its cameo portrayal of Dan Aykroyd

1350
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,480
 as not being an absurd lunatic.

1351
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,440
 Also, will someone please shut that woman up?

1352
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:33,880
 I know that line from something.

1353
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,920
 Will someone please shut that woman up?

1354
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,920
 I can't think of what it is, though.

1355
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,200
 No, I can't either.

1356
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,120
 Dan Aykroyd, '80s action.

1357
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,760
 A prequel?

1358
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,960
 Why, they're just calling everything a prequel.

1359
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,440
 They called Die Hard a prequel to Family Matters a minute ago.

1360
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,920
 Oh, OK.

1361
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,360
 Yeah, yeah.

1362
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:01,520
 The main character's name is in the title.

1363
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,120
 Uh-huh.

1364
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,400
 Shit, now I'm trying to think of a different movie title

1365
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,040
 with the name of the person in there to make a joke about it.

1366
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,240
 But now I can't even think of the movie title

1367
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,800
 that I want to make a joke about.

1368
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,720
 So now the show is really just ground to a halt.

1369
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,840
 It was the Dustin Hoffman movie where

1370
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,360
 he dresses up like a woman for most of the movie.

1371
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,080
 Tootsie, that's it.

1372
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,240
 That's the movie I was going to make a joke about.

1373
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,920
 So now we've gotten to that part.

1374
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,160
 So now, getting back to the original question,

1375
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,880
 I still don't know and I can't pass.

1376
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,160
 Shit.

1377
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,680
 Tootsie 2.

1378
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,760
 Ghostbusters.

1379
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,560
 Ghostbusters.

1380
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,720
 Tootsie 2.

1381
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,680
 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

1382
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,760
 Dan Aykroyd was in that?

1383
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,000
 Yes.

1384
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,560
 He's--

1385
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,800
 What does he do?

1386
01:03:53,800 --> 01:04:00,880
 He arranges the flight out of town for Indiana.

1387
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,040
 Yeah, he's in the airport scene.

1388
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,360
 Huh, all right.

1389
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,880
 All right.

1390
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,160
 Paul, you're up.

1391
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:13,960
 I'll do 80 sci-fi for 400.

1392
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,200
 Janet Davis still loved Jeff Goldblum

1393
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,800
 even after he turned into a giant slimy booger

1394
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,320
 and started vomiting on his food and climbing the walls.

1395
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,240
 So beautiful.

1396
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,080
 The fly.

1397
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:29,160
 The fly is, of course, correct.

1398
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,920
 Good stuff.

1399
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,200
 Also, I would have accepted Earth Girls Are Easy.

1400
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,720
 Oh, yes.

1401
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,960
 Earth Girls Are Easy.

1402
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,200
 Matt.

1403
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,440
 80s action, 800.

1404
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,120
 Remember when Dirty Dancing ripped out that guy's throat?

1405
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:41,880
 That was awesome.

1406
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,120
 Roadhouse.

1407
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,080
 Roadhouse, baby.

1408
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,520
 Roadhouse.

1409
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,000
 Driving me Swayze.

1410
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,120
 Driving me Swayze.

1411
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,960
 See, I'll take sci-fi from Paul.

1412
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,960
 200.

1413
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,200
 It's the other day.

1414
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,000
 It doesn't matter.

1415
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,680
 He was just going to get it right anyway.

1416
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,360
 Harrison Ford stands around a bunker while tiny forest bears

1417
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,120
 dismantle an intergalactic army.

1418
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,760
 Then the bears dance at a time traveling Hayden Christensen

1419
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,200
 ghost does a creepy smile right into the camera.

1420
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
 Does he ever.

1421
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,280
 That would be the first act, I think, of Empire, right?

1422
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,640
 And that's Empire Strikes Back?

1423
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,920
 Empire Strikes Back.

1424
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,520
 Pretty sure that's Empire Strikes Back.

1425
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,080
 It's Jedi.

1426
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,080
 It's Return of the Jedi.

1427
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,680
 I know what it is.

1428
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,960
 Star Wars 7 or 12 or something.

1429
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,240
 Exactly.

1430
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,920
 Exactly where I am with the whole franchise now.

1431
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,160
 Oh, that was something I was going

1432
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,400
 to say right at the top of the show that just

1433
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,960
 jarred it out of me.

1434
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,320
 I am extremely disappointed that Lucas couldn't make

1435
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,960
 the prequels more compelling.

1436
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,080
 Because in essence, the lesson there

1437
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,080
 is a valuable one that is terribly applicable to what's

1438
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,680
 going on right now.

1439
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,840
 It's just wrapped up in the worst

1440
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,000
 storytelling and filmmaking.

1441
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,680
 It's just so bad.

1442
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,480
 But it is very prescient and necessary lessons to be learned.

1443
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,880
 It's funny.

1444
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,080
 What's the name of the show that's on Disney+ right now

1445
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,240
 that got nominated for awards?

1446
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:12,760
 Andor.

1447
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,720
 Yeah, the guy who was out front protesting.

1448
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,000
 Yeah, protesting in front of Disney

1449
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,040
 because you really have a show on the air about this right now.

1450
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,320
 Did you even watch Andor?

1451
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,200
 Yeah, exactly.

1452
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,320
 Yep.

1453
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,560
 Yeah, it's pretty great.

1454
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,440
 Pretty crazy.

1455
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,040
 Well, I mean, that's the ultimate goal, right?

1456
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,240
 Repackage your descent and feed it

1457
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,840
 to you as a product.

1458
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,240
 All right.

1459
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,600
 Let's go with '80s horror for 200, please.

1460
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,840
 Yeah, let's do that.

1461
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,080
 Our mother took revenge on the staff of this camp in the 1950s

1462
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,960
 and again in the 1980s for the drowning of her son.

1463
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,320
 Oh, yeah, I think maybe later he might have killed

1464
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,800
 some people or something, too.

1465
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,840
 Friday the 13th.

1466
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,840
 Friday the 13th is--

1467
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,440
 Jason Forde's mom.

1468
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
 Oh, this camp.

1469
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
 Oh, no.

1470
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,720
 Oh, it's the camp.

1471
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,520
 Camp Crystal Lake.

1472
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,280
 Oh, we misread the question.

1473
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:57,640
 I missed it.

1474
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,280
 I missed it.

1475
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,840
 I did, too.

1476
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,800
 Camp Crystal Lake was the answer for those who missed.

1477
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,000
 Matt.

1478
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,240
 Now's my chance to seize the lead.

1479
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,680
 Are you close?

1480
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,480
 I will take '80s comedies for 400.

1481
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,080
 You guys are growing up so fast I hardly recognize you anymore.

1482
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:19,760
 Name any two actors to play either of the Griswold children

1483
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,240
 in any of the '80s first three vacation films.

1484
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,400
 Oh, jeez.

1485
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,240
 Anthony Michael Hall.

1486
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:26,920
 There's one.

1487
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,080
 Yeah.

1488
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,640
 Boy, that's it for me.

1489
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,680
 That's the one that I knew, too.

1490
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,360
 Pass it to me.

1491
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,560
 That's just-- all right, I'll pass.

1492
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,320
 It passes to me.

1493
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,080
 I'm going to say Anthony Michael Hall.

1494
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,280
 And I will pass to Paul.

1495
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,160
 Anthony Michael Hall, Jonathan Glawacki.

1496
01:07:53,160 --> 01:08:00,520
 What's her name from the fucking thing?

1497
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,720
 That's literally the question.

1498
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,200
 I know.

1499
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,520
 It's literally what the question is.

1500
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,000
 She's--

1501
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,240
 Juliette Lewis, they're thinking of.

1502
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:07,880
 Juliette Lewis.

1503
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,120
 Julia Louise Dreyfus.

1504
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,040
 No, just Juliette Lewis.

1505
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,200
 All right, there we go.

1506
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,040
 Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Baron, Jason Lively, Dana Hill,

1507
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,160
 Johnny Galecki, and Juliette Lewis.

1508
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,920
 I had such a crush on Dana Baron as a kid.

1509
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,280
 She did a bunch of like--

1510
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,560
 Which one was Dana Baron?

1511
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,560
 She's the--

1512
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,360
 Which one was she in?

1513
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,000
 Sister in the first one.

1514
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,960
 OK.

1515
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,480
 Yeah.

1516
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,440
 Let's see, it's me.

1517
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,960
 I'll try '80s comedy.

1518
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,480
 Who cares?

1519
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,000
 I'm losing.

1520
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,320
 600.

1521
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,040
 This legendary director has poked fun

1522
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,880
 at numerous blockbusters, genres,

1523
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,280
 and historical dictators.

1524
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,840
 At 99 years young, if he's still alive at all by the time

1525
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,440
 this is read, he's made 11 films over three decades,

1526
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,080
 but only two in the '80s.

1527
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,120
 Name him and one of those two films.

1528
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,960
 Ooh.

1529
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,240
 I-- what's the name of that movie?

1530
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,520
 Is it The Great Dictator?

1531
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,760
 I think it's Charlie Chaplin and The Great Dictator.

1532
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,200
 No, he's long dead, dude.

1533
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,040
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

1534
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,280
 You're down the wrong path there, buddy.

1535
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,640
 Yeah.

1536
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,360
 Wait, is this not--

1537
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,880
 OK.

1538
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,800
 This guy's still alive.

1539
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,120
 I thought this was saying-- oh.

1540
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,360
 Sorry, I misread that.

1541
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,040
 I thought this was saying he was 99 years old in the '80s.

1542
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,520
 And he's still alive right now.

1543
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,240
 No, no.

1544
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,960
 Ah, OK.

1545
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,480
 In that case, Charlie Chaplin.

1546
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1547
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,440
 Oh, what is-- oh, this has to be Mel Brooks.

1548
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:33,920
 Yeah.

1549
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,040
 There you go.

1550
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:40,120
 And then two films in the '80s.

1551
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,640
 Was Men in Tights in the '80s?

1552
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,200
 I don't think Men in Tights was in the '80s.

1553
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,560
 If it was in the '80s, it was like '89,

1554
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,480
 but I don't think so.

1555
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,360
 Yeah, I think Men in Tights was '90s.

1556
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,480
 Star Wars, Spaceballs.

1557
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,120
 There you go.

1558
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,600
 I think that's safe.

1559
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,760
 Yeah, Mel Brooks, History of the World, Part 1,

1560
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,400
 and Spaceballs.

1561
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,440
 There we go.

1562
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,680
 Paul.

1563
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,400
 '80s horror.

1564
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,000
 Man, I misread that question entirely.

1565
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1566
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,200
 But it starts with a lot of words.

1567
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,120
 Yeah.

1568
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,440
 400, '80s horror.

1569
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,920
 This '80s film franchise about spooky hauntings

1570
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,040
 was said to be cursed after cast and crew members of each one

1571
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,840
 died during or soon after making each film.

1572
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,920
 Sadly, this ended with the death of the main star of the series

1573
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,200
 at the young age of only 12.

1574
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:23,680
 Oh.

1575
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:29,880
 Oh, man.

1576
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,120
 Is it-- I think it's Twilight Zone.

1577
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,120
 But I've got to pass because I'm not sure it was Twilight Zone.

1578
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,880
 Matt.

1579
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,120
 I will also pass Jacob.

1580
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,440
 That passes to me.

1581
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,920
 I think it's the Omen.

1582
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,960
 No.

1583
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,520
 Well, I've already guessed.

1584
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,160
 I'm guessing the Omen.

1585
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,200
 Oh, it's Poltergeist.

1586
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,720
 Oh.

1587
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,680
 The Poltergeist films.

1588
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,000
 I had a coach in one of them.

1589
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,800
 It was that girl.

1590
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,440
 But that girl died in the Twilight Zone movie.

1591
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,200
 She didn't die in the Poltergeist movie.

1592
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,560
 Yeah, the little girl died from the Twilight Zone movie.

1593
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,080
 Guys, Drew Barrymore is still alive.

1594
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,120
 Ah, thank goodness.

1595
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,120
 What about Charlie Chaplin?

1596
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,680
 What's your source?

1597
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,840
 Matt.

1598
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,040
 '80s comedies, 800, please.

1599
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,760
 Despite starring in a combined plethora of beloved comedies,

1600
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,840
 often with numerous of their revered contemporaries,

1601
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,560
 these two '80s comedic actors have only shared a few minutes

1602
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,160
 together in a film musical adaptation

1603
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,800
 of a Richard Corman movie.

1604
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,600
 Roger Corman.

1605
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,800
 Oh, excuse me, Roger Corman.

1606
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,720
 Wait, hold on.

1607
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,880
 I'm trying to really dissect this question.

1608
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,400
 Yeah.

1609
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,560
 Despite being a combined plethora of beloved movies,

1610
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,280
 often with numerous of their revered contemporaries,

1611
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,080
 these two '80s comedic actors have only

1612
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,640
 shared a few minutes together.

1613
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,720
 There is a big hint in the question as well.

1614
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,560
 Well, plethora, right?

1615
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,280
 Yeah.

1616
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,160
 That's from the Three Amigos.

1617
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,480
 Uh-huh.

1618
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,840
 So there's Chevy Chase?

1619
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,360
 But they shared a movie together.

1620
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,880
 I'm so confused.

1621
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,080
 I have the Chevy Chase--

1622
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,440
 or I have the Three Amigos part.

1623
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,280
 Right.

1624
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,600
 Besides having movies off of one another,

1625
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,840
 these two '80s comedic actors have only shared a few minutes

1626
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,600
 together in a film.

1627
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,360
 I don't know.

1628
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,920
 I don't understand, because they were together in Three Amigos,

1629
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,280
 so I can't--

1630
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,800
 it's not them, right?

1631
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,880
 It's not--

1632
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,440
 It's not one of the other two Amigos, probably.

1633
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,400
 Right.

1634
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,240
 Oh, I know who it is.

1635
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,160
 OK.

1636
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,240
 I'm pretty sure.

1637
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,720
 I'm pretty sure.

1638
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,520
 OK.

1639
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,560
 Think of who else was in Three Amigos.

1640
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,640
 Yeah, no, it passes to me.

1641
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,280
 I think it's just Steve Martin and Martin Short.

1642
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,920
 No, I don't think so.

1643
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,840
 You don't think it is?

1644
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,480
 No, because they're in it for the long haul.

1645
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,680
 There was another cameo, another SNL cameo,

1646
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,040
 early in that movie.

1647
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,720
 Very brief.

1648
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,560
 Oh, the Coyote That Sings.

1649
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,560
 Nope.

1650
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,400
 No.

1651
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,360
 Gumby?

1652
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,320
 I pass, Paul.

1653
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,200
 How much is this one for?

1654
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,200
 I have no idea.

1655
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:25,040
 Come on, Paul.

1656
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,960
 I'm going to go for it.

1657
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,160
 I'm going to say--

1658
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,200
 oh, no, I don't know.

1659
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,880
 But I think the other one is Jon Lovitz.

1660
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,960
 But I don't know who the other one is.

1661
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,760
 Boy, I think we should maybe go back

1662
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,400
 and erase the A block of this episode.

1663
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,880
 Well, now I'm not sure--

1664
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,600
 Extend this for another half hour.

1665
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,120
 And I'm not sure who the other one was.

1666
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,440
 I'm just going to reorder it, Matt.

1667
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
 So this is first.

1668
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,000
 Paul, neither did I. That's why I passed.

1669
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,320
 I know, but I really don't know.

1670
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,520
 Neither did Matt.

1671
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:56,920
 All right.

1672
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,800
 I thought I knew it.

1673
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,160
 You talked me out of it.

1674
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,960
 All right, go ahead.

1675
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,560
 I don't know.

1676
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,760
 So you're passing after all that?

1677
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,440
 Yeah.

1678
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,600
 Holy shit.

1679
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,440
 Steve Martin and Bill Murray in Little Shop of Horrors.

1680
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,400
 Oh, OK.

1681
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,520
 Steve Martin and Bill Murray.

1682
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,000
 I really want to mark that as Paul got it wrong.

1683
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 After all that time, I really want to mark that

1684
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,720
 as Paul got it wrong.

1685
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,360
 I did get it wrong.

1686
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,800
 If I had guessed, I'd have been fucked.

1687
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,480
 That's me.

1688
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,720
 I'll try-- let's see.

1689
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,240
 Scores are, I have zero points.

1690
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,080
 Matt has 1,400.

1691
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,320
 Paul is winning with 2,000.

1692
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,960
 I'll just take the $600 question.

1693
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,880
 There's a $600 and $800 question left.

1694
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,400
 Gamesmanship.

1695
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,480
 Stephen King famously hated this film adaptation

1696
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,440
 of one of his books, calling it a maddening perverse

1697
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,040
 and disappointing film.

1698
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,800
 Then again, Stephen King did co-direct Maximum Overdrive

1699
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,800
 with presumably a giant bag of cocaine.

1700
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,680
 I think the bag of cocaine did most of the heavy lifting

1701
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,160
 on Maximum Overdrive.

1702
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,720
 I believe that is The Shining.

1703
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,720
 I think you're right.

1704
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,200
 It is The Shining.

1705
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,600
 Oh, funny.

1706
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,360
 He did not like that.

1707
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,680
 Paul, close it up the category and the game.

1708
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,680
 '80s horror for $800.

1709
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,280
 This is for the win, baby.

1710
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,960
 Brad Dureth plays a voodoo-wise serial killer

1711
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,720
 inhabiting a redhead doll named Chucky, who

1712
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,400
 befriends a young Chicago boy before trying

1713
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,640
 to kill Jack Skellington and the mom from Seventh Heaven.

1714
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,560
 What ironically named brand of doll is Chucky?

1715
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,400
 He's one of the good guys.

1716
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,800
 He's one of the good guys.

1717
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,320
 Absolutely.

1718
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,720
 And that is the game.

1719
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,560
 Paul wins on a question that Matt

1720
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,880
 knew the answer to as well.

1721
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,760
 He has 2,800 points.

1722
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,160
 Matt has 1,400.

1723
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,520
 I have 600.

1724
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,600
 And that's from Keyster Sunday.

1725
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,840
 Before you wrap up, Jacob, can we go back to that question

1726
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,400
 about Steve Martin a little more?

1727
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,200
 Good guy.

1728
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,000
 Yeah, but it wasn't about Steve Martin.

1729
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
 It was just a--

1730
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,840
 I don't know.

1731
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,680
 It was a tough one.

1732
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,560
 That was a tough question.

1733
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,040
 I'll be a dentist.

1734
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,480
 Honestly, the toughest question we've ever

1735
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,520
 gotten on this show, I think.

1736
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,880
 Definitely.

1737
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,680
 Just hard.

1738
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,560
 And honestly, the toughest topic that we

1739
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,680
 tackled on this episode.

1740
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,280
 You guys, you SOBs.

1741
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:18,960
 You asked for it, then thought for so long about it,

1742
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:19,920
 and then passed.

1743
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,760
 Well, you know what?

1744
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,520
 You guys told me it was about--

1745
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,640
 you had convinced me it was about Three Amigos.

1746
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,720
 And that's the question convinced you of that.

1747
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,560
 It wasn't about Three Amigos.

1748
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,960
 The clue--

1749
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,560
 It referenced Three Amigos, didn't it?

1750
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,640
 Steve Martin.

1751
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,160
 Yeah, it said plethora.

1752
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,440
 I can't believe we actually are going back

1753
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,680
 to talking about this question more.

1754
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,480
 How?

1755
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,840
 It said Three Amigos?

1756
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,960
 It said plethora as a hint to Steve Martin.

1757
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,040
 Oh, OK.

1758
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,000
 Yeah.

1759
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,760
 Jesus Christ.

1760
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,560
 OK.

1761
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,480
 I want to thank--

1762
01:16:51,480 --> 01:17:00,840
 I heard the episode where they got political is the one

1763
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,680
 where they broke up.

1764
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,800
 It's like, even true, if you listen to the episode,

1765
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,680
 it's not about political stuff.

1766
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,520
 They didn't break up for the politics.

1767
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,880
 It's not the part that you think.

1768
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,600
 They broke up over a Steve Martin question.

1769
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,080
 Last episode, everybody.

1770
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,360
 Enjoy it.

1771
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,840
 Slow walk into the final ep.

1772
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,000
 We have one more episode on Twitch,

1773
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
 and then we're doing the next two in person, right?

1774
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,920
 Paul, because you got here--

1775
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,280
 That's right.

1776
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,560
 --Wednesday?

1777
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,680
 Yeah, I'll be here Wednesday.

1778
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,480
 Wait, we have another episode on Twitch?

1779
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,360
 I'll be there--

1780
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,160
 I'll be in late--

1781
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,360
 Oh, today's Friday, right?

1782
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,360
 Today's Friday, yeah.

1783
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,040
 Oh, oh, it's Friday Night Live.

1784
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,880
 Late Tuesday, if we want to try and get another one.

1785
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,160
 I don't know.

1786
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,440
 You're coming in late Tuesday?

1787
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,640
 Yeah.

1788
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,560
 Oh, then yeah, I think we should definitely try

1789
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,600
 and do one on Tuesday, then.

1790
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,280
 Right?

1791
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,400
 Tuesday night?

1792
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,480
 Maybe we try and do a Tuesday night?

1793
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,640
 Yeah.

1794
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,720
 All right.

1795
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,560
 We'll figure it out.

1796
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,400
 Production meeting.

1797
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,360
 Let's tune on air.

1798
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,280
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1799
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,760
 --production meeting when we talk about how sausage gets baked.

1800
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,360
 So anyway, I think we should record a show on Thursday.

1801
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,240
 Professionals.

1802
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,880
 I want to thank Penn Jillette for creating this podcast.

1803
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,520
 Thanks, Penn.

1804
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,400
 And I can't--

1805
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,800
 I have very mixed emotions about whether it's disappointing

1806
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,760
 or actually quite a relief that Penn's been

1807
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,240
 in England for the last three weeks

1808
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,840
 and we haven't done Penn Sunday School about anything

1809
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,360
 contemporary.

1810
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,880
 Oh, congratulations, by the way, to the Magic Circle in the UK

1811
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,960
 for finally legitimizing themselves.

1812
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,880
 Yes.

1813
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,080
 Isn't that the fact?

1814
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,360
 That's exactly right.

1815
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,160
 The honor goes to them.

1816
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,680
 Good job, Magic Circle.

1817
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,600
 Penn and Teller have just honored them.

1818
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,240
 So the next episode of Penn Sunday School

1819
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,320
 is going to be recorded at Scoop Fest.

1820
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,080
 Oh, my god.

1821
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,280
 It's going to be insane.

1822
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,040
 And right after that, Piff is coming

1823
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,320
 in to do the fullest breakdown of his trip to Holger.

1824
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,800
 Is Penn going to stick around for that?

1825
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,160
 The idea is that Penn stick around.

1826
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,200
 And then-- also, then we can get Piff on Penn Sunday School,

1827
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,880
 because Piff really read Penn the Riot Act

1828
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,280
 when Penn was bitching about not being in the Magic Circle.

1829
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1830
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,720
 Piff famously was like, they have one rule, and you broke it.

1831
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,400
 I don't know why you're upset about it.

1832
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1833
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,640
 He's going to get rubbed in the face.

1834
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,600
 Oh, boy.

1835
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,400
 I'm looking in chat.

1836
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,320
 No, Hondo will not be coming to Scoop Fest this year.

1837
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,080
 That was the whole being in Spain thing.

1838
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1839
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,600
 Although, we are bringing in guests from another country

1840
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,640
 this year.

1841
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,640
 That's true, that's true.

1842
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,480
 That's a first.

1843
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,280
 It is.

1844
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,560
 International guests.

1845
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,720
 International pop.

1846
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,520
 Oh.

1847
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,320
 And we're not just talking about Texas, great night.

1848
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,560
 [LAUGHTER]

1849
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,360
 I want to thank the following people who also--

1850
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,240
 the video of their head exploding

1851
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,440
 is more famous than their movies.

1852
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,320
 That's John Holtson, John Jacob Scoopelheimer Schmitt,

1853
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,680
 Johnny Parker.

1854
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,040
 Why am I reading so weird?

1855
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,360
 No, no, Johnny Parker.

1856
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,880

1860
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,280
 Thank you so much.

1861
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,720
 Big thanks to these people who obviously

1862
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,920
 missed a little something watching Andor as well.

 And I want to thank the following people who also,

1870
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,480
 no matter where you look on ABC or Disney's websites,

1871
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,000
 you will not find these names.

 These individuals were in a plethora of movies

1878
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:30,080

1879

 >> And the following Scoops all fell asleep in their cars,

1883
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,920
 but don't worry about them, they were just drunk.

1884

1904
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,960
 We say it every episode, but we love each and every Scoop that

1905
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,040
 listens to us.

1906
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,240
 We love each and every one of you that has supported us

1907
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,120
 for all of these years.

1908
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,920
 And I hope that you all feel supported by us as well.

1909
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,640
 And I mean that sincerely.

1910
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,800
 We love all of you.

1911
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,720
 And your support absolutely has meant the world to us

1912
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,600
 for years.

1913
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,400
 A lot of people go over to--

1914
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,720

 I'll play those jingles and do all that kind of stuff.

1918
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,200
 But those people go over there.

1946
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,600
 >> That was just a jingle that doesn't mean anything.

1947
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,840
 >> The funny is that it's a wonderful gem.

1948

 >> It's one of my brother's favorite things.

1949

 He loves every time we play that.

01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,520
 >> And it cracks me up too.

1951
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,080
 >> I'm authentically failing at it.

1952
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:34,840
 I think that's why.

1953
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,600
 I'm not purposely being lame, I crash and burn.

1954
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,520
 And I think that's why, that's what fuels it, I think.

1955
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,040
 >> It's gold.

1956

1959
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,800
 A lot of people have shopped up.

1960
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,240
 We got our share from the site, and I was like, oh.

1961
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:51,760
 >> Yeah, yeah.

1962
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,760
 >> A lot of people boning up for Scoop Fest, I think.

 Thank you.

1967
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,040
 >> I just like that they're boning up.

1968
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,760
 >> Well, that coexist skull is doing numbers.

1969
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,660
 I'm betting.

1970
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,240
 >> It is, it is.

1971
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,600
 >> The coexist to punish your enemy skull shirt is pretty great.

1972
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,120
 It's the Punisher skull that you see everywhere on the backs of pickup trucks and

1973
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,560
 on t-shirts and everything.

1974
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,120
 But it's that with the, I never remember the name of the flag.

1975
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,640
 The full, not just the Pride flag anymore, but the full.

1976
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,040
 >> It's the Trans and Prides, it's the Trans and Prides, right?

1977
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,600
 >> Yeah, yeah, it's all of the extra stuff tagged on with the Pride flag and all.

1978
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,360
 It's great.

1979
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,560
 So it's all of that within the Punisher skull.

1980
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,080
 It says coexist, it's like the old coexist stickers with all the different

1981
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,040
 religious iconography on there.

1982
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,960
 It's pretty good.

1983
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,560
 It's pretty good.

1984
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,040
 >> All right. >> The porn themed hat did not disappear.

1985
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,080

1986
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,040
 you, you can select it to be printed on a hat.

 You can also select hats.

1988
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,720
 >> Okay.

1989
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,760
