 teenager thing to spell yeah it's time for Matt Mattingly's ice cream social city in
 Las Vegas it's Matt Mattingly sitting in Pittsburgh at Paul Mattingly city in Las

 that's right like he's he's just gonna smell like stinky teenager dunked in
 cologne are you worried that he's just gonna develop like a new expensive habit

 think he's just gonna be stinky well I mean it's crazy you go shopping for some
 of those those perfumes they're big money some of them I bet they are I bet
 how much is a like like a standard bottle of cologne now how much about a
 standard bottle of cologne 20 bucks well I spent I spent almost nine for my
 generic I'm ahead of you on this one what we have done is we have ordered
 ambergris in bulk and we're gonna do a DIY cologne kit in our backyard because
 it's cheaper to just order the whole whale eat the meat and get the ambergris
 out then to just buy the ambergris separately and plus that gives you oil
 for your your whale oil right if you like the home if you like the meat you
 might as well just buy the whole whale that's it why fuck the ambergris when I
 can fuck the whale for free wait is that how how does it go that's not an
 expression anywhere but yeah no I'm making in my new expression why smell
 the ambergris when I can fuck the whale for free there you go there you go yeah
 we're gonna put a bunch of vats in the backyard but like you know bourbon in
 one and then like you know some kind of weird floral arrangement and another
 we'll just see how it goes yeah this is this is smart this is this is that Matt

 Oh the cologne box is expensive guess how much that fucking box cost that
 Kristen Dior limited edition cologne box and you got all these I don't think you
 can kick this one in the dick nope higher $1,200 hundred no hundred dollars

 cologne bar a this is where you put your briefcase I just want you call it what
 you call it before your your fragrance wardrobe this is where you store your
 your scent wardrobe I don't understand spending that much on something like look

 you're traveling all the time you want something nice to keep your smells in
 Matt you're traveling all the time I didn't realize that client he's got fish
 to keep his smells in you are the target demographic if you if you see me three
 weeks on a cruise ship holding up that box with the title I work for free

 one that looks like a dude's torso that's 320 bucks so yeah some of these
 things are fucking oh my god Creed Royal English leather Jesus Christ from the
 band yeah I just heard I just from the band I just smelled as much as we can do
 this the whole pod but I think you can continually find things that are too
 expensive in the perfume world if you keep searching the internet I didn't
 search very hard and it already gave me a lot just that was the very first spray
 with arms wide open those are the instructions good one that's a good I'm
 so alone I sprayed too much cologne and now I'm all alone hey off-air we came up
 with the best solution for yesterday's or sorry last episodes rather excuse me
 last episode scoop mailer saying what do you tell people when they ask about your
 son's circumcision right and off-air I said oh you should check out this podcast
 I listen to called some other kids dick Chronicles I already know you love other
 kids dicks love this ML Kennedy is batting a thousand here the Creed cologne
 smells like a worse version of pearl jams use my atomizer Scott step let it
 spritz you clean and clear step spray me with that spritz use the atomizer off-air
 we're gonna do it yesterday which was I've had I've had a couple of clips go
 maybe viral is too strong of a word but my most popular clips clips have taken
 off I get stats right and so yeah these these one a couple of clips do well a
 couple comes do well and also I get stats that say you know 75% of people
 watching and commenting are not your followers right that's like a sign that's
 what you want right right external engagement and it's one where I'm
 handling a dickhead it's just two videos part one and part two I'm handling some
 dickhead at one of my shows this is the state of the world man all people want
 his crowd work and I and it's funny because when things go popular means I'm
 gonna get criticized right so there's a lot of like you're thin-skinned you're a
 terrible person that guys making reasonable requests to a show that I
 went to a show and then during the show opened his mouth and just had a
 conversation with the person on stage about what he wasn't doing these are the
 people who are on their phones the entire time that a movie is happening in
 this so we'll do some backstory I'm at Mystique dining and Folsom when with
 that clip right and they just have like a security camera and if you know
 basically for like liability purposes like is a magician loses it which I
 came close to so that's not my camera that's just the the don't get sued
 camera at Mystique dining so a couple things he's he's one in the first clip
 he's lecturing me about how he saw some other magician and he went to bed that
 night he figured out the card trick and he won't let me move on my show unless
 he tells me the story and Mystique dining is a parlor environment right so
 it's me at a table surrounded by 24 people in a room right and I perform at
 a stage where the front row is 30 feet away so when you when you tuber me the
 story yeah there was more to the story than I went to bed and figured it out in
 my sleep there is more to the story and that like okay so what happens is I
 start going I said the first joke is like and no one cares right and it gets
 this it gets this big laugh from the audience and the reason why it's cuz the
 way Mystique dining works is you you go there and you have this opulent
 beautiful meal with everybody in the room before the magician comes out the
 magician is the last 45 minutes of the of the of the experience right so this
 gentleman had been the mayor of dinner yes so when he told me that story it was
 probably the fourth time the audience was hearing that oh my god and I'm
 hanging out right I'm back I'm on the backstage area waiting for the things
 so I know this I've already been told this guy keeps telling the story about
 how he figured out a magic trick and he won't stop telling people told he told
 the one waiter told the other waiter he told Steve the the emcee and Booker Steve
 Branham who runs the room told him and then interrupted my show while I was
 trying to start a card trick to do it and so it just been blitzing people the
 story the whole time so when I start laying in them I it's getting these
 huge laughs because they freakin heard it they're done with it yeah they're done
 with it now it's weird to have this clip take off for me personally like I I mean
 he's an old guy right it's like I am picking on an old guy right like I do
 feel bad like he's not he's not being an egregious drunk heckler you know
 he's just make himself mayor of the room yeah right and then the second clip is
 when I start to get into my card trick he starts busting my balls for not
 having a sealed deck to start off the thing with okay and some other magicians
 have chimed in going like it's a reasonable request
 magician bullshit magician to magician abuse and you don't have to take it man
 man there's oh I feel you brother I feel you that is that is a nonsensical that
 is awful this business too long bullshit magician responses I've been performing
 for other magicians too long and also is the only people that that would be
 reasonable from is another magician at like a magic conference or something
 like that or in a fool us type setup where they're doing any of that bullshit
 because what you're doing isn't doing you're not teaching people how to do
 fucking card tricks you're doing a show but not even that it's one of those
 things that speaks to ignorance because any magician worth their salt knows that
 sealed or not it doesn't really matter yes you can gimmick a deck to be sealed
 yes sealed it's an ignorant comment it comes from a place of ignorance and
 trying to be ignorant it's trying to wind up it's trying to one at one up no
 I don't even mad at some I dealt with some similar shit at the guy who
 disrupted the show I'm really angrier at the magicians who are defending I don't
 see so much in a in a in an improv way recently and it got me it sent me to 11
 immediately I'm just like shut your teaching no no no no no discussing
 discussing intros of all things oh I was just like shut the fuck up you are you
 are just talking shit to talk shit now yes yeah it's just like the like devils
 advocating on the fly to make it seem like you're being smart apps of fucking
 yeah giving giving an example oh my god my dogs are going crazy yeah no I was
 just I was talking about it too they're angry no no I want to I want to hear
 your opinion on this Matt so I was just talking about introing and one of these
 simplify an intro because we had previously done an interview and the
 interview got really dark and so at the end I grabbed your line which the this
 is all intended to be comedic in nature yeah yeah to get us out of that death
 spiral yeah and we and we were fine but I said hey in light of the fact that I
 don't think anyone has any fun stories to tell right now about their day to day
 yeah why don't we just go with song titles or rather song lyrics for a get
 right yeah and and I was describing the thing and this is the way I put it I was
 like so we'll get a song you know we'll get a lyric and I want you guys to just
 think about a lyric that you're gonna call out don't you know really ponders
 think about something that actually means something to you don't just shout
 out who let the dogs out just give me a lyric and you know what as a matter of
 fact give me a couple give me like two or three and I'll pick my favorite one
 let's see what we do and I got oh you don't want to be fishing yeah wait yeah
 thank you is accusing you of trying to cherry-pick the most in that the
 description of how we could do how we could do it not in doing it just in the
 description of saying hey no you give me three I'll pick my favorite and was
 saying oh we don't want to be fishing I'm like you are so wrong on this you
 couldn't be more wrong oh and so I kind of laughed because I was mad to the point
 of explosion and I was like well you know there's burning kind of - we're
 burning the who let the dogs out yeah thing and that kind of thing and and you
 know I did I couldn't in the moment get my head back around but like like even
 Liz the great Liz Allen has articulated to me you can do that you can pick you
 know it's not like you're not I'm not you know first of all look most of the
 time the audience shouts out a bunch of different suggestions at the same time
 anyway usually exactly you've heard anyway so you end up you end up
 assessing the situation anyway the idea no but the idea is that you were you
 were disparaged that's what happened and it took precisely and it made you so
 angry in the moment you couldn't get your words back around on you and I get
 that completely yeah but the idea that someone would use you of like you're
 literally trying to like you he literally just like made you into some
 kind of cheap artists some sort of hack yeah yeah meanwhile you're actually like
 trying to spread a wide net yeah that would drive me crazy yeah I needed some
 validation it's also not a quiz it's not it's not a test it's not like let's see
 who the best Improver is by seeing who can take suggestions the fact is it not
 do this is a goddamn show no shit dude well that's that the ultimate the
 entertaining the that's the ultimate thing is like okay let's go around all
 this loop-de-loop and then the end of the day you're gonna you're gonna show
 me something on stage worth a fucking right reminds me of the time the
 emphasis brigade was on Conan O'Brien early days right so so they were on the
 core for including Amy or Amy Poehler were on the stage and they go like Conan
 Bronson cuz he you know we really love improv and I got hooked into this I was
 like oh they're gonna let them do improv on Conan like this is awesome and they
 go like oh can we just have like you know a setting or whatever they're like
 all the Swiss mountains they're like oh and then can we have like a character
 from fix you know history like Buddha and like oh and then we have like you
 know whatever something you might count as like it's like cakes or whatever and
 like okay we take you to a mountain where Buddha is having a birthday cake
 and they make like noise in the curtain raises up they have a perfect set of the
 perfect set just made exactly for that right exactly so the idea like so that's
 yeah is that you're like you're like oh wait let me see if I can get it close to
 my my right yeah yeah yeah I'm really hanging on to ain't no holla back girl
 soon as I get no holla back girl then I can strike because I've got a great I've
 got a great Gwen Stefani in the pocket like what the fuck I came here to do a
 Gwen Stefani impression and I'm not leaving until I do it it just made no
 fucking sense to me I'm just like you want to see what you're fishing what
 environment was this where were you I've already said okay okay okay it's a weird
 that's a weird one yeah so I should just say like more more on the the clip
 because I told everybody in the zoom there was more to it the clip goes on I
 do get it I do get a sealed back so like right part of part of the things that
 I'm like grappling with as I take on the dumb internet comments is I think I'm
 being funny the whole time I know I'm I know that I'm being upset but I think
 I'm being upset in an amusing way if I thought I was being upset in a way that
 wasn't amusing I would have I would stop and that's the hardest thing to convey
 right like like if you look at the who that goat episode that we did with the
 with the guys right if you go back and listen to that episode on our feed I am
 the butt of that episode and I tee myself up for it numerous times you you
 open that door over and over again yeah but it's what the show needed right so
 I'm all purpose and you served it yeah I do it right so a couple people came up
 to me and they're like hey man that was really tough up there I go what no that
 was exactly everything went exactly the way we wanted you know I remember Justin
 Robert young shooting people like no you don't know what's going to go away stop
 talking to him it's like no I did what was supposed to be done in the show
 right I'm very happy and so it's very hard to convey that like I am taking the
 piss out of the guy I think he knows it a little bit I know it and the audience
 is going with it and so I thought the odds would go with it on the internet as
 well and for the most part they have right I'm pointing out the the few dicks
 but I will say what my social media team edited out what's me finally opening up
 a sealed deck which probably took forever because that's another thing
 about the that's the other joke about like why are you using a sealed deck the
 primary reason is that it is a pain the ass open a fucking back of cards and I
 used to open sealed decks for my tricks and it would sometimes take forever and
 it's got to deal with the cellophane yeah you got to deal with cracking the
 box yeah then you got to dispose how many just that cellophane the two tops
 and the two bottoms here the two jokers on the bottom and the two cards on the
 top instruction cards yeah and then you got a shuffle them and else other stuff
 right and so I do I do I do oftentimes skip a go here's here's the deck I've
 been using from last night look they're all shuffled and I have the person look
 at them and I give them a quick shuffle or they can give him a quick shuffle and
 it's just for time it's just for time yeah it's just but also if you look and
 you see that it's a real deck and if you're handing it to other people that's
 it's 99% of the time that's gonna be just a deck you're not gonna hand a
 gimmick deck to a person right there are tricks I do where I don't have the deck
 sealed but if they if they're looking at the deck and they're able to shuffle
 that deck and hand it back to you that is better than a freshly unsealed deck
 yeah that is as much as clusterfucky as you can get mathematically right so it's
 so it's edited out as I finally get all the cards out and do whatever and I put
 the cellophane and the advertising cards and the stuff right in front of his face
 okay and I go here I'm gonna shuffle while you inspect this garbage is that's
 not in the clip that's great that's things like I I actually thought it was
 fun for the audience to actually be annoyed but then follow through on all
 of his demands right so like I did I did I actually did yes and him and do my
 card trick under test conditions but that's not good social media right so
 so that's the hard part is so I'm getting accused of like not playing fair
 with the guy and you're like no I actually if you saw the whole thing you
 did another guy goes I don't get it every every clip I see you and you're
 just some thin-skinned guy losing it and I was like that means you just saw two
 clips yes because my other clubs don't show that my other club don't have it at
 all so I was like alright this good Jesus it's called a brand so yeah I got
 it like I have a tick-tock page I don't even look at that my social media runs
 entirely goes that clip killed on tick-tock and I was like oh man this is
 not it's always the stuff you don't expect though right I know no I mean I
 put that up there thinking it was gonna be something I when I said the cuz like
 I said it's a security camp footage so I said right I said this is this is bad
 this bad quality but I think this will play and so I was actually right in that
 well good instincts yeah I'll tell you else only wants to see seal dicks and
 that's the following sponsor today's show Matt manly's ice cream social is
 brought to you by night as in nights of the roundtable nightmare the nightmare
 dedicated to wordplay that is hopefully still funny when I'm sober that's from
 goofs scoop in 2023 over it up that is nightmare the nightmare that's the
 product hello tis I nightmare the night mayor yes I'm the mayor of the night how
 about that I'm a man drunk and this is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my
 life I'm a mayor I'm also a mayor and a night and a mayor of the night and a
 nightmare this is the mayor of the night
 the mayor of the night do we have any old business the council will adjourn
 after we dedicate a tree oh tree oh yeah the mayor of the night yeah better
 haze groups check out I'd like to apologize to all of our listeners there
 the mayor of the night was really cherry-picking what business he wanted
 to attend I'm sorry it was in fact it was offended by it was in fact a
 cherry tree I was planting a cherry tree so that I could cherry pick the whole
 thing yeah yeah yeah so there's someone reporting their tin scoop part two of
 me with the sealed deck it's got 217,000 views tick-tock tick good and that'll be
 great as soon as tick-tock starts to monetize I would tell you also the
 weird thing about it is because I've had some of those clips do well but they've
 not gained me followers this one's gaining me a bunch of followers which is
 a weird which is a weird moment as well and I can't chase this right you can't
 go like after oh I should start really busting everyone's balls then you will
 just be a thin-skinned magician like we're gonna experiment with this company
 with our podcast right we're gonna give them a month run and see what they do it
 and they asked me they're like is your brand on ice cream social like like
 similar to your brand as a magician like do they compliment each other and I said
 oh not at all no I'm a relatively clean magician and I am absolutely filthy on
 this show so no it does not not exactly brand synergy no I started off as a
 magician I was filthy when I started there so originally it did it did
 compliment each other right right but I don't I was remembering that I used to
 ask for a borrowed iPhone by asking for a hand jobs machine right yes for the
 hands jobs machine I asked for the hand jobs machine I still haven't donated my
 Halloween candy I gotta look for a place to do that still I got 20 pounds of
 candy download just send it with a Sarah to work she'll bring it to work it'll be
 gone in 20 minutes European acrobats we'll eat the shit out of that candy we
 already got we already got snow up here oh no yeah yeah yeah we already got snow
 and it actually stuck to the ground so I'm very concerned about what's coming
 this winter yeah yeah yeah but I'm also pleased to say that my Christmas
 decorations went up at a very timely time because half the neighborhood is up
 and cooking now a week after I put my stuff up so it's it's all good you're a
 trendsetter buddy I was I was speaking of our regional news Jacob are you
 excited that the shuck era has begun down in New Orleans what's happening so
 is this a is this a ballplayer of some kind yes let me say some my kids are
 suddenly into football enough that they're curious about watching it when I
 watch it okay but part of it was we were sitting around two quarterbacks came up
 one was Michael Pennex from Atlanta my kids literally were like does that say
 Penix and they were hysterical that someone else playing football has a
 robot penis called called the Penix and we just made robot penis jokes if the
 Atlanta Falcons were smarter they would follow your lead oh yeah and then then
 it was the beginning of the Tyler shuck era in New Orleans and which my kids are
 really loving being part of the shuck era they don't give a shuck they're part
 of the mother shuckers they're ready to rock is it his name pronounced show is
 that true I don't think it I don't think you say the C at all in his name oh I
 have only listened to anyone pronounce it shuck is it pronounced is it
 mispronounced I I thought it was Tyler show I don't know okay I could just as
 easily be the person wrong here is it Patrick wah is that right yeah the old
 hockey player there's some new ones too there's a new Roz out there are there
 more was there are there's one who plays for Vegas now yeah but yeah no that's
 that's great and to answer the question you're really asking I can't get behind
 the New Orleans Saints this year at all they're just so bad I get I mean we're
 on we're on our own text message shades and everything so Matt sees that I get
 genuinely aggravated when New Orleans wins the game we want the draft pick
 stop it yeah what are your guys sincere feelings now that the FBI has come out
 and said that all of all of organized sports is a Psyop is there I guess you
 haven't really lost interest it hasn't changed my view on it in any way okay
 because there's not a single part of what they're saying that I'm surprised
 about right I don't know what you're talking about Paul oh that's a just you
 know the corruption of betting throughout all the coincides with the
 fact that like games are fixed and rigged and yeah fixed by the Mafia
 leaning in on on individual players so it's scarier than it being rigged like
 ha ha ha they wrote a book of football or something like oh it's scarier yeah
 but it's yeah but it's funny so what's crazy to me is specifically the
 pitchers indicted for throwing a first pitch ball on purpose right because
 that I know it sounds strange but the competitive balance of that is really
 funny to me because everyone's happy right so if you're betting the first
 pitch is gonna be a strike that's a really hard task for the pitcher right
 but the batter also wants the first pitch to be a ball right and and the
 other team wants the first pitch to be a ball so the idea that like I'm gonna
 throw a ball first the catcher is to just go like oh let me just stick my
 glove over here no problem like it's like the ease of everyone making money
 off of a first pitch ball is hysterical to me because it's like everyone's like
 great that's just easy and fun and for basketball and for basketball it's
 hysterical where people are betting unders mean that like I'm gonna go in
 and not rebound I'm not gonna grab a ball I'm like that to me is like
 hysterical and as you uncover the stories like these are people who are
 making a lot of money suddenly making money on like dumb bets that don't pay
 in the in the arena of the money that they're making right and so like one of
 the players it turns out like he just had never paid his taxes on his crazy
 NBA salary and had just a crazy ass tax lien that he was trying to get out of
 and so that's why he got into it people being roped into illegal poker games
 the poker game thing with like Chauncey Billups and all those yes that's that's
 bizarre and what this one Paul no so it's literally like sports celebrities
 luring just other motherfuckers into playing poker games with them and then
 not playing an honest poker game yeah so so illegal poker yes I did hear about
 that illegal poker rooms and states that don't have legalized gambling of the
 ice poker running illegal poker game so they're running these crazy rooms using
 celebrities basketball players to lure in people with money yeah and then using
 literally like microchipped cards and like I saw I saw technology I saw like
 right they had these glasses on and you could see every card like every card was
 clearly visible from the back like I knew what everybody had the whole time
 yeah it's wild and I was laughing at someone who's one of those sports
 podcast listeners a big card collector and stuff as he goes to card collecting
 conventions and he goes I mean I don't want to say nothing but I was wondering
 why Chauncey Billups was at every one of these events why is this active NBA
 coach and Hall of Fame basketball player finding time to go to every card event
 there is he's getting paid like 50 G's each time because coaches make the
 fucking doughnuts coaches make millions right so like the idea is no way these
 card things are paying and like that's actually worth the time but yes they are
 in a way they are in a way yeah right yeah it's just free money that's crazy
 what's crazier is the argument so like what happens is this is this is a thing
 where both sides think they're totally correct right we should stop all this
 legalized gaming gambling on sports it's gonna mess with people's lives right and
 then the fucking degenerates that are like no no no by having the best out
 there and we and we're catching these these spikes of weird bets we're
 exposing what could be happening behind the scenes or off off books and smaller
 books other places like you want to keep it out and play in sight you want to
 get some I feel like that's a really good point I think it's a good point
 with all of them except for first pitch ball that's the only one that I'm like
 you just can't everyone's favor to do it like it's just everyone will take it
 it's the worst thing what do you think about the always go into game seven
 thing or often going to game seven thing oh I don't we've tried to rig that I
 don't I don't think those stuffs can be that on that level I don't think things
 can be rigged on that level I just don't think that's tough I mean especially
 with this World Series which was crazy great the amount of ones I went to
 extra innings I mean you can't say let's have one game go to 18 innings when they
 have to play the next day at 5 o'clock like yeah no one's writing that right
 like no one's Reagan that but the fact that three of the games that went went
 to extra innings I think in the World Series including including one literally
 literally a bonus game they literally did 18 innings they accidentally played
 yeah they don't they played eight games so I think it's just I think it's it's
 just a testament to the competitiveness of you know these athletes are still
 athletes are they're still psychotic to be professional athlete you have to be a
 psycho like we have to remember right so I don't I think you'd only rig it so
 much football being the hardest one right like that's the one where like you
 you can't oh football is is just impossible to rig the full game without
 like truly cooperation well that yeah conspiracy theory level cooperation if
 you like leave these real dumb plays where you're like oh that was an
 intentional fuck up but the thing is the thing is it's so precious right so like
 if you drop a pass on purpose yeah to underperform to pay a bet you you might
 get yanked out of a game for good like like like you're right it's so the
 marketing that ego for those guys too yeah like the a team maybe scores four
 or five times you know an entire game you know they basically get like eight
 to ten chances at driving it's just not there's just not enough leeway for
 someone to purposefully underperform and then not suffer dramatic professional
 consequences for it yeah it's just not it's just not the this is the I mean I
 could be proven wrong I would be some of the stuff that's come out it's been
 baffling I reserved the right to be corrected but so far I mean look look at
 look at me like the Giants are trying the hardest and for three quarters
 they'll do well and then for the fourth quarter I guess you could probably
 that's your best argument it's that the Giants are paid by the mafia to stop
 trying in the fourth quarter there's really not a lot of evidence to support
 against that you take that's pride fucking with you that just seems like
 it might be true yeah I again I have made good on my promise not to watch any
 NFL this season and I haven't but I do see the memes keep coming up in my feed
 because I am in the Pittsburgh area and you can't avoid it and it's just every
 week I see them I see Steelers shame themselves like stuff like that like
 Steelers embarrassed and in primetime and I'm like of course you hired a
 schlocky freak to be your new QB they are a confusing team they're confusing
 team you ain't kidding why I'm glad I'm not watching this year because it's just
 dumb every time they're like these guys are dirt they come out and they score
 like a thousand points and they look like a juggernaut and then right you go
 like oh I guess they're good and then they're like oh we can't score at all
 no no no no ten scoop says the Giants are great it's the damn game that's too
 long yeah you're right we've got that fourth quarter out yeah three period
 game why don't we just if they just copied hockey to be undefeated three
 quarters in my in my family in my family in my family text read my oldest
 brother said it he doesn't trust anyone who dies their beard anyway and I said I
 feel attacked and then the goes right though and the coach got fired and I
 this week and I just thought up it's bad week for the beard die boys bad bad one
 my brothers and beard die beard die that that that that adds up quick man that
 ain't cheap yeah no it's not like cologne you know I actually you should
 see that I just bought a $7,000 case for my beard tie for my just for men right
 in yeah yeah yeah yes different beard dies for different events well some days
 you're going all gray some days you're going and instead of having like a one
 through ten for the for the for the for the case lock it's just different jewels
 right it's just diamond real jewels yeah yeah it's all hold your eight dollar
 just for men okay that's right that shit is such a mess to do too I've only done
 it like twice yeah I was in 50 shades I was using the brush and stuff and that
 was easier so III do I do both yeah now we're getting into yeah now we're
 getting into it I the the brush in one can feel like a little a little cakey on
 the yes it definitely does and so I find it like makeup yeah I find it hard to go
 to bed right like oh yeah you got to watch that shit off your face right but
 then you're trying to scrub it and when you do comb in beard die when is it
 washed like when is it done I don't like I don't have a base of all white you
 know what I mean so like right I just simply go from yeah it'd be easy for me
 there's there's my all white beard then I go to bed with like a big scratchy face
 but it looks so much better the the the comb and beard I look so much better
 than the just for men died it does look sharp right yeah someone pointing out
 just for men not the most woke name and the modern selling points right yeah
 just for men I mean that's just uh that's just on them they're just they're
 just losing money by still having it called just for men right yeah that's
 the whole that's the whole men problem thing that it's all just you heard that

 museum in Australia is being forced to allow men into art into an art exhibit
 originally conceived for women only after a tribunal ruled discriminatory following
 a complaint by a disgruntled man who was designed a denied entry right let's see
 so Tasmania's Museum of old and new art Mona has been ordered to stop refusing
 entry to persons who do not identify as ladies to its ladies lounge exhibit
 within 28 days after ruling was made blah blah blah does it say why she did
 it yeah it's hard you have to find out why she did it yeah experimental artwork
 by artist and museum curator Kershah K A E C H E L E is billed by the museum as a
 tremendously lavish space where women can indulge in decadent nibbles fancy
 tibbles and other ladylike pleasures hosted and entertained by the fabulous
 Butler some fella from New South Wales had paid the $35 Australian entry fee
 it's about $23 US and was barred from entering the exhibit on April 1st last
 year so was barred on April Fool's Day according to the documents he said that
 made an equal rights argument yeah there you go there's basically there's a
 priceless like Picasso was it like in the women's restroom was the her first
 argument for putting it as women's only okay but I thought it was done in
 response to something but I might be I might be just trying to find it here
 yeah Nick Newman you're in the chat unmute yourself if you can are you
 walking around where are you I'm here fellas what can I do for you I was
 realizing the other night why we came up with the turn barn and you can tell me
 if I'm wrong on this all right I'm learning this as you are yeah yeah
 because if you said horse house it gets really confusing I'm only gonna call it
 the horse house from now on please bring all that hay to the horse house please
 built the horse house oh we should call it something else people think sex
 workers in my backyard speaking that I just got my tickets to a great show for
 January 23rd jokers of magic oh awesome you're coming out oh this is
 Lexington you come you'll be back in town I'm back in town and that's my
 birthday oh wow we got to go out to your birthday yes do that yeah because you
 are now you're at your other horse job right now right you're at the West Coast
 where it doesn't rain it does not rain what's what's what's what's the horse
 news out there what's what's going on out there on the West Coast you know it is a
 whole different ballgame out here this ain't Kentucky kids now Kentucky I
 think Kentucky is like very like lavish horse farms a lot of like crazy money
 going into these like perfect conditions for horses and that kind of stuff it's
 right out there if you're on the West Coast and you have that kind of money
 you will buy a two-bedroom house right or groceries different different level
 of investment I want to grab like cuz here in Solana Beach it's a it's an
 upscale place mm-hmm and I want to grab people by the shoulders and go you know
 that very small house you live in you can buy an entire horse farm in Kentucky
 that's exactly what happened to Las Vegas post-pandemic before the pandemic
 is to say it all the time I was like wait till people from California realize
 they can sell one of their houses and buy two out here and then just commute as
 needed as soon as the work from home thing took off that's exactly what
 happened out here is we can't even get one house in Vegas but we could get one
 in Pennsylvania right yeah well it's close to Pennsylvania that West
 Virginia is one of the few states that have a uptick in in population because
 the one thing people left those these terrifying hell scapes and went to West
 Virginia and bought all the land you could have right now the big the big
 race out there's the Breeders Cup the Breeders Cup just wrapped up so that it
 just the first week in November it wrapped up so that's the world was what
 was the big news what was the big scuttlebutt from the Breeders Cup last
 minute scratches horses got all the way to the gate and they they were not
 allowed to participate because of due restrictions because we have federally
 oversight it now we have federal oversight gate it got all the way to the
 gate and they were like no not you there's like leading horses off the
 track yes and it's like oh okay and then like owners just embarrassing it's
 really embarrassing when your horse has to be led off the track by the pony
 without a saddle on the reasons the differing reasons but but veterinarians
 seeing signs of soreness or or not okay unsound horses but the track that they
 run it at the particular track had a problem for a couple of seasons of an
 unusual amount of horse deaths not that particular track the okay the track
 you're thinking of is Santa Anita which is in Los Angeles oh yes you're right
 the track here I have to say has one of the highest safety ratings in the world
 it's it's it's San Diego got it okay okay I'm mixing it I'm mixing my West
 Coast tracks this track was built how dare you this and I'm Paul if you want
 to warm up this track was built on in 1939 on a loan taking against taken
 against the life insurance policy of Bing Crosby that's true so somebody just
 bet against being living and won 100% they shorted being Crosby's life
 insurance to build this track how does that even work it was a friend his name
 Pat O'Brien so I'm fucking friend yeah very buddy boy I gotta let you know this
 cough isn't getting any better go ahead and take a shot
 hey that sounds well all right nobody I've said it for years nobody does a
 better Pat O'Brien impression the Nicholas that's it oh I like it let's
 have some more horses coming up and they're wearing makeup like a beat-up
 person just like just don't mind me I'd sure like to race today I just fell
 down the stairs fell in the paddock you know what I I should have cooked the
 dinner right I should have cooked the oats right oh you you don't know Bob
 Baffert like I do he can change I can change them everyone the other claim to
 fame of this of this track is that this is the place where Chris Jenner and
 Robert Kardashian first met oh so everybody brings it up like that's this
 boy is that what's going on I didn't hear you go ahead is is it an old cursed
 Indian burial ground as well is that what's going on with that fucking place
 kind of might as well be it was fucking Shawnee ghost popping up in the middle
 race during World War two this track was used as a as a plane wing assembly
 factory where was the where was the fancy wing assembly factory that is a
 really interesting Beverly Hills here in Del Mar that's a really interesting
 tidbit I wonder what they use Santa Anita for and then everybody immediately
 was like don't ask so then I looked it up and it's like oh what was it it was an
 internment camp yeah and I was like well that's not that's good not gonna be on
 the tour that they at least get to race the horses so what were the big horses
 that won and should we keep keep an eye on them for upcoming not for long
 episodes and then also what was the attendance like oh absolutely so the
 attendance was was was like a thousand down from land from last year okay a
 thousand fewer guests which is hardly noticeable in a place like that you're
 talking about sixty three thousand people over two days okay okay okay okay
 and then the so your current world champions are the Japanese are the
 current world champions of horse racing oh they the the current world champion is
 a horse named forever young from from Japan okay did Japanese horses usually
 do well in these races so I last year they sent 19 horses to this event and
 and they won none of the 14 races no that's a tough that's and I said they
 could have sent 19 hermit crabs and got the same result so this year guess who
 called Newman's bluff and sent 19 hermit crabs literally they can't they sent nine
 horses this year and just absolutely crushed oh wow okay all right well then
 that's exciting we'll have to look out for so they're figuring it out and then
 I I got to briefly talk to micropoly listen to not for long micropoly is a
 real character a real treasure so Mike on Twitter has named himself the
 commissioner of horse racing yes good good categorize himself as a real
 disruptor of the space as he walked by me we made knowing eye contact and I
 said hey good luck commish three paths on the back and a smile so that's there
 you go he got so Frankie to Tory had himself a nice weekend Frankie to Tory
 this is the best thing if you again not for long podcast that the shirt tries
 to make it crazy that Frankie's still racing at his age and then we find out
 that it's very common for racers to race at his age they say down those lock and
 he's just trying to clutch at any opportunity he gets and he ends up
 working with Bob Baffert one of the world's famous trainers and they give
 them a horse in the Breeders Cup so it's like really that's the it's the last the
 last that's that hard Scrabble Road we're following with him he's just
 falling on hard times but possibly due to his suspension and we will just say
 for legal purposes made up the fact that we also think he's a coke head and so we
 often make jokes about that as well total fabrication we're just a comedy
 show we're just a comedy show we're just wacky we're wacky guys we made Robin
 Lee to cut the maniac we just do these things and so we can't be held
 responsible for things that we make up Frankie to Tory's bread surrogate so
 Frankie he would never eat bread that guy get real that man hasn't seen a carb in
 30 years so Frank he did not he was not riding the Japanese horse I imagine he
 was not all right. Well, I'm still looking out for that tough luck kid. I
 feel like he's still going to find a place to shine. He's going to land on
 his feet somewhere all four of them.
 Well, thank you. Thank you Newman for I want. I wanted my Breeders Cup update. Oh
 wait. Also, how's the how's the horse you and my dad bought claims in as that
 horse still training well looking for that first start should be fine at that
 point your dad's gonna have a lot of fun with that it should be fun. What's the
 site you guys went to? Yeah my racehorse.com. My racehorse.com you can buy really small
 shares micro shares of racehorses so my dad owns like a hundred twenty dollars a
 hundred twenty dollars share of like a five hundred thousand dollar horse. Is your
 father the world's oldest brony at this point? My dad? Yeah. World's oldest like
 that's the world's oldest brony. He's basically a My Little Pony fanboy. Yes.
 He's basically living out of My Little Pony fantasy. This is amazing. Yes. Yeah.
 Does he have does he have a small statuette replica of the horse? That's
 how I should get him for Christmas. Actually get him a custom pony. Get him a
 little get him a My Little Pony with whatever share it is like one you know
 three thousand. Do they do some horse hair in an envelope? My Little Ponies
 like they do custom the the if only there was a way that you could figure
 that out. Oh my god. What's Briarfest? Okay so Briar horses are the the
 collectible horse action figures. What? They're made by the Briar company and
 they're not getting into that. I dodge that fucking bullet. I bet. And they have a
 full-blown like week-long festival for these plastic horses here in Lexington
 every year. Oh my gosh. And they are fanatical. To the point where we think
 about closing to tours during that time. Oh there's so many people come out for
 the for the for the horses for the toy horses. They will they'll buy two hotel
 rooms at the Clarion and they will get permission to remove the furniture from
 one of them and set up. And they just turn it into a store. A store for people who will do your your
 plastic horse's hair for you like a salon. Yes dude. On their website they've got like
 pictures of these of these this horse that they are I guess introducing the
 2026 Briarfest celebration horse Corgi Hill Flinka. And it's a real horse. Yeah yeah
 it's just a picture of a real horse and then right below it they've got like the
 plastic things that they've made of that horse. And they and the kids I give to
 their credit they did a good job. The adults will fist fight over that horse.
 Right. I can't picture someone getting their horse's doll's hair done to
 present it to another person like huh. Oh you can't. They have they have a
 legitimate show. Let me bring you into my world. Wait but do you show off the grooming of the hair of your
 figures? It's all about customization. Yep. So you get your base you get your base
 bucks yo like this is your standard buck and then it's all about people who can
 trick these things out. There's a guy I follow on YouTube. His channel is Mr.
 Home Arcade. This cat has got money and he gets four of everything basically. Yeah.
 And he also pays all these other awesome creators to send him customs. So the
 stuff that he has is one-offs, totally unique, but really cool, really well done.
 But a lot of it is you take the base figure and then just build on it from that.
 Yeah yeah yeah. So it's all about that base. True or false Newman? One of the
 biggest Briar collectibles is just a Catherine the Great with her legs wide
 open. Catherine the Great playset would sell like hotcakes. Talking about fist fights. That is the longest, saddest fist fight.
 There's gonna be two punches. Me hitting you and you hitting the band. Me hitting you and me hitting your surface.
 And yes Scoop Jesus with legs wide open. But they do like custom saddle readers. A person making tiny little
 saddles out of real leather. See that's where that's when it gets really yeah
 yeah yeah yeah. See with with the Masters of the Universe especially, that's my forte, it gets to
 like characters and people that were featured in the cartoons that have never
 been made into figures. Which that's getting that list is getting smaller and
 smaller and smaller. Of course. But there are still some and these
 people want these one-off figures. It's been their dream like oh I really want
 this figure from this episode and if it's never been made people will make it.
 But then the interesting thing is the fandom will respond and if it's a nice
 enough custom and enough people go oh well I really wish I had that figure too.
 Mattel follows those boards and they build out figures based on fan demand
 and that's how we get a lot of these really rare weird one appearance. I'm
 telling you right now the person making custom leather saddles for those Briar
 outfits doesn't know that there's a whole battle cat saddle universe out
 there. Oh yeah I don't know I thought they might be they might know they might
 know. Looking at some of those Mondos but but that's it that's the fact too is I
 would not be surprised if some of those what do you call that Newman the whole
 ensemble. I guess it's a lot of livery right? The tack. The livery the tack is
 that what it's called? It can be livery yeah. So that would encompass the what
 the Jockey rides, what the Jockey wears, the colors. Oh that's livery for sure yes. And then the
 saddling and all that kind of stuff would be tack. So I mean I'm gonna go out
 on a limb and say there's probably been an occasion where a model tack maker has
 inspired a real-life replicae. Oh sure oh yeah I'm sure I was worried we were
 gonna look at this like as a strictly parasitic relationship but no no no it's
 copacetic. What are you talking about? I agree symbiotic. Symbiotic yeah not copacetic. Yeah yeah yeah no these guys these guys
 absolutely inspire you know the the big boys to make the big toys. That's how it
 goes. Alright does have three battle cat saddles already you're right Rich Scoob. I
 have more than three. So past Breeders Cup how long is your season out there
 Newman? I'm getting right ahead home just for it to be cold in
 Kentucky. And then what's the next big race on the radar for possible
 Triple Crown people because the Breeders Cup starts at all right? The Breeders Cup
 starts at all the Breeders Cup Juvenile starts at all and then the next in March
 there there are some there are lots of there's the the Arkansas Derby there's
 the Rebel Stakes there's a Florida Derby but what everybody's really got their eye
 on because of the international horses that are making a bigger impact is that
 the Dubai World Cup the the United Arab Emirates Derby is probably gonna be the
 next. Oh that's that's early early March. Okay flying horses makes me scared. Mayor
 Force One. So cuz dude do Americans set up their best horses to Dubai or is it
 all cautious thing? Oh always. You said a horse flight's the most boring flight
 in the world right? I hate it so much. Well it's not that boring it's like a
 it's like fucking Russian roulette the way you described it. Yeah standing on
 there with with a knee with a put down and a dope up in both hands. It's almost always a very
 boring flight. It's the ride of your life. That that reminds me of how I used to
 describe being a fireman. Oh yeah. It was just long periods of just complete
 boredom and then every once in a while it goes freestyle crazy. So that's about
 what it is. Okay back to chili. I forgot about the
 put down juice Paul. How could you? You can murder a horse at 30,000 feet that's
 amazing. Numerous times someone has spent tens of thousands of dollars to ship a
 horse to somewhere and have it arrive dead. That's what has happened.
 The numbers not zero. And you know what else that makes me sad about that is just like my
 recent experience with the injected dye. I'll wager that if you put death juice
 in a horse you can't really go glue or meet with that bad boy either. That's
 pretty best. You're pretty much just throwing him on a fire pit or great
 question Paul. Nick how edible is a horse after you kill it? So it's okay. Yeah all
 right. The half life's pretty low. Well it's kind of like how much rat feces
 they'll let into a McDonald's hamburger. How much phenylbarbatol they'll
 allow into an average mix of puppy chow. I don't know what's going on. Skippy's
 just kind of logy today. He got his breakfast. I don't know. Ate a lot of horse meat. He had his
 purina. He had his kennel ration. I don't know. Thank you Newman. Thank you Newman. We're going to do a little Jack vs. Nerd.
 Buddy thank you guys. Go get them. Purino failure. Here we go.
 Jack vs. Nerd. Explosion. Of irradiated horses. Oh they didn't make it. Oh that's too bad. Man I paid a lot of money for this
 flight. Do I get any of that money back or anything? Oh no no no no. Oh I guess
 you did transport the horse. That is that is all I paid you to do.
 That seems only fair. By the way the ladies lounge is the name of the
 Tasmanian Museum Mona. It's the name of the art installation in Mona. It was
 ruled illegal by the the first judges who dealt with it. It has gone through to
 the Tasmanian Supreme Court who did uphold the legality of the exhibition's
 women-only policy. There are now ways that men can see it. There are a couple
 different ways that they've made it so that male visitors can go in and
 see the display. It features what you were saying Matt. It features
 expensive jewelry and art including Picasso canvases as a comment on sexism
 and historical exclusion. Though some pieces were later revealed to be fakes
 or replicas. I guess you're making the point. Yeah that was it. He
 inadvertently made the point of you know how dare you exclude me. Oh yeah. Meanwhile
 women have been excluded from male spaces forever and there are still so
 many of those things still on the books today. Yeah so it's almost like that guy
 didn't didn't get it. He didn't. He really didn't. We got a scooper coming to us today from
 Canadian Scoop Crystal. Canadian Scoop Crystal sent a whole email along with
 this. We will get to that email at a different show. I've got it set up in the
 queue. This is a scooperty all about Canada. It's provinces, Canadian singers,

 beaver. It's her mom's beaver. It's the beaver. Matt you're up. I will take actors. For 200. What
 actor is known for humor superhero movies and was the world's second highest
 paid actor in 2020? I was the second highest paid actor during COVID. Ryan
 Reynolds? That's probably my guess. Oh it is Ryan Reynolds. Good job. Paul. I'll go
 singers. For 200. What Canadian band wrote the theme for the song, the theme
 song for the Big Bang Theory? That would be Bare Naked Ladies. The Bare Naked
 Ladies. Look at us, three for three on Canada. We're so much better on Canada than

 heritage shaped by its long history of fishing, whaling, shipbuilding, and funny
 accents? Oh wait is this the is this the Newfies? Is this the Newfoundland?

 home improvement and is now acting on Broadway? Broadway? Broadway. Shoot there
 are so many there was three three different models but is Pam Anderson on
 Broadway right now? I think so. Is Pam Anderson on Broadway? Yeah Pam Anderson.
 Pam Anderson is correct. I don't know what she's doing on Broadway but I didn't
 know she was on home improvement. Yeah. Was the whole thing with her and Liam
 Neeson was that completely staged or was that partially real or does anybody know
 did it ever come out? As far as I know it's real. Are they still together? Oh see
 as far as I know it was staged. Well I we actually I thought about trying to even
 have him come on but I know one of the writers of the movie. Okay. I know who
 wrote Airplane and he says it's legit. Oh well there you go. But it's also in his
 interest to say it's legit. Sure. That's fair. Paul you're up. I'll go with
 Canadian singers again. For 400. This singer started her career at 16 and has
 won 10 Junos, a Canadian Music Award and nominated for eight Grammys. Now Canadian
 Scoop Crystal I recognized you felt like you had to tell us what a Juno was. You
 had to tell us that it was a Canadian Music Award and you were correct. You did need to tell us that.
 100%. Alanis Morissette. Alanis Morissette is incorrect. It's Avril Lavigne. Avril Lavigne. The other one.
 The other one. There's a bunch. I'll try Animals for 400. What urban animal plagues
 most cities especially here in Canada that we created a sidewalk memorial to
 one? Most cities especially here in Canada. Okay is this gonna be like a rat
 or is it gonna be like a moose? I think because it's Canada. I think it's a
 raccoon. Oh or a raccoon yeah. Raccoons are big in Canada. They had a cartoon called
 the Raccoons. It was mostly it was made by a Canadian animation house. All right
 well I'll pass cuz I have no idea. Okay. Matt. Matt passes to you. I don't know. I
 mean I want to guess pigeon but. Oh that's a good guess too. Oh yeah yeah. The
 chat wants me to say raccoon. I'll pass. Paul. I will go with raccoon. Raccoon is correct.
 Matt you're up. Provinces for 400. What province is home to the to the large
 nickel a wonder of the world and is surrounded by most of the world's fresh
 water? Pass. Passes to Paul.
 Nova Scotia. I'll pass. That passes to me. I is it Ontario? That was gonna be my guess.
 Ontario right? Yeah. I should have guessed it. I should have guessed it. I should have. I'm an
 idiot. I'm a weak weak person. Well we both passed on Raccoon. I wasn't passing
 on Ontario. There you go. That's true. Paul. I'll go Canadian actor. For 600. Daily double. Oh here it is. Now the real money.

 his diagnosis that he has a foundation for in finding a cure? That'd be Mr.
 Michael J. Fox. Michael J. Fox is correct. Yeah. I always forget that he's
 Canadian. Yeah he seems too aggressive. Agreed. Agreed. I'll try I don't know.
 Animal. 600. Other daily double. Whoa man now the scales are flipping. What
 Canadian animal was adopted by a vet and ended up in a zoo in London, England to
 inspire a writer to create a beloved character?
 What Canadian animal was adopted by a vet and ended up in a zoo in London,
 England to inspire a writer to create a beloved character? Okay this is a real
 this is a real long way to get Canadians credit for this famous English character.
 It's Bullwinkle. A moose. It's just a moose. The moose and squirrel. Let's see
 there's Bullwinkle. There is whether like beloved animals could come out
 of their London. Is this a bear? Is this a bear? Is this a bear? I don't think it's
 Oh it could be Paddington. Paddington bear is mine. I'll say a bear. I'll say it's a
 bear. It's Paddington bear. Oh Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. You should just stay with bear buddy.
 I should have just said bear. Why didn't I just say bear? I should have just answered the fucking question. Matt you're up. If I just answered the question I would have got the right. I don't
 know Winnie the Pooh is British. Christopher Robin that very American
 name. Yeah yeah apple pie Christopher Robin. Okay I think I'm gonna go with
 singers. For 600. What country artist once worked at McDonald's starting
 writing songs at age 10 and was forced to take a hiatus from music due to vocal
 issues caused by Lyme disease. We all know this famous Lyme disease McDonald's
 worker. You worked at McDonald's at age 10? No he started writing at age 10. I'm trying

 Canadian indie band known for neighborhood rebellion and black mirror fuck I don't know pass oh shit it passes to me oh I think I do know well what is it my only guess would be Our Lady Peace but I can't answer it in good
 conscience because I don't like them but I don't think they're indie they're pretty big I don't know I don't even know what makes an indie band indie anymore it seems like half the indie bands are
 signed to record labels and I don't understand how that works I'm passing to Matt this is obviously Brian Adams guys oh no no pass pass oh it's Arcade Fire oh they're an indie band they're indie and a Canadian I didn't know they were
 indie I'm Canadian for that matter it's all crazy to me it's me I'll try animals for 800 what animal medium sized wild cat character's eyes a character character's eyes by long dense fur triangular ears with black tufts at the tips and
 broad snowshoe like paws is that a Lynx that sounds good to me I'll go Lynx oh my goodness Jacob Tari's failed system let's do a score check Jacob score check Paul and I are tied in the lead with 800 a piece but Matt is right on our heels with 600 there aren't anymore
 daily doubles left but there are three questions left provinces for six and eight hundred and Canadian actors and actresses for 800 it's gonna be tough you're up hmm do I want to leave the two province questions for you two or not let me just remind you that I got Ontario I'll take
 Canadian actors please for 800 who had a career spanning 60 years he appeared in more than 100 films and 150 television programs portraying more than 220 actors and our characters and died in 2010 I have to remember a Canadian actor who died in 2010 that's that is precisely what the question is asking you to do yes I'm just okay where was I in
 2010 and let me try to picture when I was grieving that loss of Canadian actors let's see I had been really upset about 9/11 for nine years at this point I can't I pass I can't I can't Paul John Candy died before that right yeah yeah I think so
 yeah who else is kind of like John Candy lemurs screamer creamer says or name one of the 220 care oh man it's red green no I have to pass I don't know it passes to me I definitely know this but I'm passing anyway out of sportsmanship Leslie Nielsen
 oh that was who I was thinking of who hilarious but I was like no you just have airplane on the brain because the earlier questions oh it is Leslie Leslie Nielsen okay yeah that was thinking of that's so funny Wow there you go could have one to cost me the game guys cost me the game well Paul and I could both miss our questions Paul you're up gamesmanship I have to go for 800 800 going for the win what is the most recently added territory to Canada it was added in 1999

 and I owe it to just the fact that Jacob could just just passed fun to guess it is it is game but my my passivity is never you know weaseled me out more than this is this game scooper to eat such a weasel yeah I had two right answers in my head and didn't even guess them
