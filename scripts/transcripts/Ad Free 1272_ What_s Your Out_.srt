00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

 Hello there I am so happy you're here because this is the part of the show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,320
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. We don't have a new list yet

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,620
 We're recording this show in the past. There might be a new list by the time this show gets published

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,780
 Otherwise, you're just gonna hear me saying this this is what you'll hear if we don't add the list in

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,440
 I feel like that's right. Yeah, but let's go right here though. Yeah, this is where we would put it

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 It feels like we're if we had the list would put it right here

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,340
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I sure hope you do preaching fun commas ring

 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:10,840
 People in the chat about putting up pictures of their dogs. Oh, we've gone all the way down to just dog pictures on

 That's Paul Mattingly in Las Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,280
 Hey everybody, welcome gents, how we doing so many cute dogs

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,240
 As we are

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,040
 Airing this show we're airing from the past. I've had a birthday. I bet it went wonderfully

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,760
 I had a little vacation. I bet it went wonderfully Matt. You're on the road non-stop right now. What's going on with you?

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,520
 This I'm trying to think of what this is Aaron because I am doing this thing where I have to go to Chicago

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,120
 Yeah, do one show and then get up the next morning and fly out to

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,480
 St. Louis and then drive to a gig in Missouri two hours from the airport

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,580
 Do a corporate show that's supposed to be blood money. So this will certainly come up on the show again

23
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,280
 Yeah, because we a lot of drunk people go back to Chicago finish out of Chicago Magic Lounge where I'm gonna turn around

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,720
 And then go home

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,760
 For for the holidays and then after the holidays it go right back out. I got a corporate in South Bend, Indiana

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
 whoa

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,480
 And then I'll be heading to the jokers of magic after that, which I'm so excited about

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,240
 And while you're in South Bend, are you going to air your grievances with the Notre Dame football team and their new?

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,280
 Scheduling thing that they're gonna do with the college football playoff. That's a big part of your trip

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
 It's gonna be wearing Miami shorts and Alabama sweatshirt

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,900
 Just whistling, yeah

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm also gonna be doing a comedy club in Chicago, which I have to get more details on but I'm one of the office

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 We have like one random off night

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,180
 On the tour and Mike Mills arranged for us to give it give us a shot in a comedy club

35
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,240
 Which I'm so excited about it's gonna be Chicago right the comedy club in Chicago

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,260
 Which means it's for people out there who are near there. It's a little more affordable than the old

37
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,920
 Chicago Magic Lounge, so

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,480
 Hopefully you can come out and check out that this is part of the jokers of magic tour, right? Yes

39
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,060
 So it'll be it'll be if me myself Mike Mills Eric Dittleman Ruben Moreland who I'm so excited

40
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,520
 I don't think a lot of people know Ruben, but you will know and love him. I'm so excited to do the tour with him

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,080
 Oh, very cool. He's very funny like a ball. We'll get him on the pod as well

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,760
 Are all four of you gonna do the comedy club or is it? Yes, just know. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, also fun

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,160
 So you guys you guys get to kind of write up stuff for a smaller stage then yes

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,120
 Yeah, yeah, and I could do more crowd work and things like that that I'm excited about and

45
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,880
 Yeah

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,320
 My secret goal is to be comedy club worthy

47
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,080
 This is why I'm trying to I'm trying to cajole Brian brushwood and to into maybe thinking about doing his first shows since 2010

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,400
 He's done some shows here and there but he hasn't truly

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
 Tored like going on done shows since 2010, which is a crime, right?

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,440
 A crime a crime people who who like that guy and I think I think it's fine

51
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,720
 This is here's here's my options as a as a pro, right? The jokers of magic. Hopefully this becomes a thing

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,300
 It's a lot. It's a lot of heavy lifting right now to do any kind of live theater and any kind of live touring right now

53
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,680
 Just for the for the people living in the middle to lower class. We are in a recession for people in the upper class

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,840
 Hopefully they want to come see tours

55
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,360
 That's where we're at that's where all of entertainment is at right now that is that is

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,320
 Desperately true. Yeah, this is why concerts are crazy expensive is because there's enough rich people that that they can afford that

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,240
 The sphere just put out numbers yesterday for what they what they say. They've made on the Wizard of Oz. Oh

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,400
 And it's like two hundred million dollars. Yeah, and it's I mean it's it's still yes, and they're still in the red

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,720
 But you know

60
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 So

61
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,880
 You know when I try to think about like what I want to do

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,520
 It's like I can try to produce my own shows and try to do like hotel hotel the hotel model where you do like

63
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,880
 You team up with a fancy hotel you put like an awesome right together make it like a a wine and whatever and do that kind

64
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,960
 Of stuff, but that involves a production value, which means like hauling things in

65
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,720
 You know putting a pipe and drape and that kind of stuff and having a lighting package and an audio thing

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,720
 And I was like, no, no, no. No. I love performing comedy clubs. I

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,120
 think

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,160
 This is me. This is I'm just this is the real deal. That's what I'm talking to my friends privately. Is that yeah

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 I think magic is a bigger addition of a factor to a comedy club

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,200
 Then comedy is an addition as a factor to magicians in a theater. Does that make sense?

71
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,480
 I I think you're absolutely right when I used to work at the Laugh Factory

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,160
 every now and then a magician would come through and

73
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,440
 Honestly for better or worse sometimes it would change the dynamic of the room completely

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,880
 Yeah, and so when the magician came through and they were good. It was like, holy shit. This is great

75
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,040
 This is built for this. Yeah, and when they came through and it was bad

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,400
 They were like, oh this is this is supposed to be funny and it's terrible and that's it and that there is there's a there's a

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,140
 There's a lot of there are cheeseball magicians out there doing cheeseball comedy

78
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,960
 That puns and and I win you lose lines and that kind of stuff

79
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
 That I hate so it's but that's so that's the obstacle

80
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,880
 but I think like in terms of like where I think I can put my effort and prove to I can do something and

81
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,120
 Where I think the show would be additive and where it doesn't attack my weakness, which is adding crazy

82
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,440
 I'm not a good tech person. So adding crazy production values, not my strength. I

83
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,320
 Think Amy at comedy clubs would be great. And then should it work? Should it work at all?

84
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,200
 Then it's easy to add Paul. It's easy to add other acts to the lineups and stuff to make it an even crazier cooler

85
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,880
 varietal of a show

86
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,140
 But but this is this is in the meantime. I'm just bound to cruise ships. Well, they figure all this out

87
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:29,760
 Yeah, yeah, and it's also a matter of just like you said before the timing of everything and where the country is financially

88
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,880
 God bless Mike Mills. Mike Mills is trying to make sure the jokers of magic gives it a shot

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
 He's trying to find smart ways for us to tour

90
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,240
 It is an uphill battle for all tours right now and he runs a giant touring company

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,720
 So when he says that he's talking he's talking with evidence about you know, 25 properties that he tore

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,800
 Oh, yeah, you know like Mills entertainment, you know that with a John Candy documentary was touring with

93
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 with different guests high-end guests, you know like

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,200
 Talking about John Candy and people worked with him and Ryan Reynolds was hosting all that

95
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,040
 That was Mills entertainment, right? You might have even seen tik-toks and stuff with the stand by me cast

96
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,720
 The whole stand by me cast is reunited. Yes. They're starting that is that is that one of his

97
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
 Yeah

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,200
 So it's a brilliant idea by the way, that's it. So they're being very nice. He's locking into some good stuff there

99
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,920
 They've always been very innovative

100
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,000
 With their touring and they've and they've always been really cool stuff

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,880
 But he has data when he says it is a crazy slog right now to be trying to fill get both the seats in theaters

102
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,800
 He means it and so I am feeling very fortunate that he is putting me in the mix

103
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,360
 But that's our thing that should property and that's it

104
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,280
 I think that we are trying to make this viable, you know

105
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,280
 put some butts in seats and with the idea that we're playing a long game of

106
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,040
 Trying to make this a thing that happens semi regularly

107
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,800
 Until the economy kind of turns around for some people and we can go go go actually bring it to the people in a regular way

108
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 Yeah

109
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,600
 I mean, I remember 2008 that's what I had to do, you know boats boats kept me going for

110
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
 nine months

111
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,000
 right basically a year I had to be away for a year to

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,760
 Keep it cooking with the same kind of financial realities that were around for entertainment. It's crazy times

113
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,800
 So all had to sell boats. Let's get into whether or not Mike Mills is a fool for relying on me

114
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,120
 So I am was finishing up show. I have a guess

115
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,920
 I was finishing up shows in on the princess cruise ship and I the last day of the cruise

116
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,400
 Not disembarkation day, but the day before here our last day at sea as we were heading towards Florida

117
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,320
 Okay, I locked myself out of my room. I

118
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,200
 Told the story on Penn Sunday school, but you know Penn just kind of laughed at me and then you know

119
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,640
 I figured it can get more mileage here

120
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,240
 and it's also I told Penn we recorded the day that it happened and

121
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,160
 Now we're we're a week and change later and I'm still still processing so it's worth bringing up again because I'm still oh my

122
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
 so I

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,040
 Get online, but you okay to get back into my room and

124
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,880
 It's a long line. So we said like you don't want anything to go wrong in the last day of the cruises because that's the day

125
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,280
 We're everyone. There's so much stuff going on with people getting stuff approved. Oh like a customer service line

126
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,200
 Yes, yeah, you're waiting in a customer service line to get a key to get back into your room

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,400
 Yes, and that's the day I was wondering why there was a line in front of your room to get back in. Oh, sorry

128
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,480
 No, no, thank you for you probably clarifying for the service as well. Good job and

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:38,840
 You're at customer service everybody's at customer service because it's the end of the cruise and everybody is I'm sure very happy with all of the

130
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,600
 Accommodations and things that they have paid for on the cruise and they are there to tell customer service just how happy they are, correct

131
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,080
 Good, and so I'm it's I'm online. It's like I was like I blew it

132
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,880
 I had my headphones with me because I like myself because I'm gonna go to the gym and I and I like my headphones and not

133
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,560
 My key so I'm listening to podcasts for like 20 minutes

134
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,160
 And then I finally get to like on deck before I go to my little desk

135
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,280
 And there's a circle of desks waiting for people or about like, you know, six different customer service people

136
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,720
 Okay of these desks you kind of you got to answer like a lollipop you come up you're online

137
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,200
 I'm picturing a circular room. Yeah. Yeah, and then I

138
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,680
 Take off my headphones

139
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,000
 Cuz I'm on deck getting ready to rock. Okay, and about six feet to my right is a guy complaining about

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,960
 His bill on spellbound, which is the name of the Magic Castle experience that I'm a part of

141
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:39,840
 He was like I did not mean to tip the magician

142
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,080
 So much money I meant to tip the magician several hundred dollars

143
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,420
 But I tipped them too many hundreds of dollars so I need I need some of that money back from the magician so I can get

144
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,160
 Home that's that's what the whole problem was. Yeah. Look, it's a big experience and you know, you can

145
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,280
 It's it's a bunch of people like coming around and so like, you know

146
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,840
 Who knows which part of the experience he wasn't happy with, you know, okay drinks could have been the whatever

147
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,140
 And then he starts saying like yeah, the magician was just terrible

148
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,200
 Okay

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,080
 This guy has gone to a customer service representative on a cruise ship

150
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,800
 To talk about a show that this customer service representative

151
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,360
 Certainly hasn't seen he wants his drinks taken off of his bill

152
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,800
 He doesn't want to pay for the drinks. He doesn't want to pay for the drinks because the entertainment was not great. That's right

153
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
 Okay

154
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,440
 Huh? This is a schemer and I'm on the other end of that when I go see a show and the entertainment is not great

155
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,340
 I am more reliant on the drinks than I usually

156
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,960
 Those are the shows that I do not dare complain about the drinks. Yeah, and

157
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,480
 I am like, well, there's two magicians. Maybe he's complaining about the other magician

158
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,200
 Then of course he was

159
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,240
 Okay, I did

160
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,840
 26 shows on this last run on princess. Okay, 26 shows in one week

161
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
 Over seven days. Yeah

162
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,760
 Wow, okay. Sometimes that's it. That's multiple shows a day. Sometimes for 30 people sometimes for two

163
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,400
 Okay, that's the deal

164
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,560
 It was a shift recently right where normally it was always for 30 some odd people

165
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,080
 It was always a always a that they wouldn't give me a show unless they packed the theater

166
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,160
 But right they change the way the experience works and how who can sign up for it and when and so you kind of have to

167
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,000
 Take people as they come and you end up yeah, he goes for people. So it's really weird to give a theatrical

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,300
 Magic experience to eight people. Yes

169
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,280
 however

170
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,480
 One day goes he goes. Yeah, I mean, you know he started off with like, you know

171
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,700
 You can't someone take a card that he found the card like who can't do that. That's what he said to the person type

172
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
 Yeah, who can't do that?

173
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,620
 Wait, who can't do that? He did not start going through

174
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:15,320
 Individual aspects of your show. He sure did Jacob. He sure did to the customer service rep. Yes

175
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,080
 Who was not asking for any details whatsoever? She was typing. She was like, hey

176
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,480
 Okay, what do you need? Let's see if I can do it. Yes, and so there's she was not asking for details

177
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,960
 So it was clear that he had like for hers this in his head, right? Oh

178
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,640
 He was getting out like his speech, you know

179
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,800
 Yeah

180
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,120
 And so warming up by the way, so that my opening trick that I do in the smaller environments is I have someone look at

181
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,000
 An envelope I put in my pocket

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,120
 They take a card they sign it. I

183
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
 say I

184
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,000
 Haven't put in the back of the deck. I put a side in the back of the deck to shuffle it

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,480
 And I say where's the envelope and they go in your pocket and I reach my pocket all the cards are in my pocket

186
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,220
 Then they literally look back to my left hand which was previously holding all the cards and it's holding an envelope

187
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,800
 And it said the envelope is their card and it is signed by them. Okay, anybody can do that

188
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,520
 Anybody can do that anyone can do that. So I was offended at his description of my opening

189
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,280
 You should be

190
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,740
 You're right to be offended by that gave him a piece of my mind. Now. Look, you know, I'm a human

191
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,240
 I'm a self-conscious human, you know, I'm a thing. I'm a we've established on this podcast. I'm a thin-skinned human

192
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,520
 I do not don't be me to Matt. He'll be up. It'll upset it

193
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,380
 So at first I really think to like hide

194
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:44,920
 Like I literally go like oh my god, like how embarrassing like I literally almost pull my hat like over my head

195
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:54,600
 Are you you're still in line at this point or you're a different desk, okay, right so you're in line, but he is but he's being

196
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,860
 Serviced by the customer service people. That's right

197
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,960
 Okay, and if you were across the room, I wouldn't hurt it. And if I had not locked my key of my door

198
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
 I would never known about it

199
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:13,140
 Then I'm called I have something to say about the magic show quote-unquote that I watched

200
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,800
 And I am

201
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,120
 You know

202
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,820
 Did you put your headphones back in surreptitiously

203
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,800
 No, I really had a voice go off in my head. That was like as if like I was parenting myself

204
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,900
 I literally go like don't you dare don't you dare and I do not interact

205
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,360
 No, no, but I was like don't hide like I was like, okay

206
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,200
 I literally got self-conscious put my head over my head and the voice went on my head was like no

207
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,360
 Fuck him, right?

208
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,360
 And so I went full like I like total split personality went full aggro

209
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,120
 Then I put my head back and I started standing tall and I started staring at him. Oh

210
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,640
 Okay, but you haven't spoken to it I haven't spoken to him and then he complains about a second trick

211
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 Oh boy

212
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,640
 He's gonna go through the whole routine he's got notes I did 26 shows

213
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,560
 and

214
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,080
 25 of them every trick went amazing. Oh

215
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,040
 buddy and 26 shows I did six effects on his show

216
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,320
 One trick went wrong

217
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,520
 Okay, and it was my ring trick and it was like not to be too magic about it

218
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,360
 but I and I've performed this trick a lot and

219
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,800
 There was a design factor in this ring that I did not understand and therefore

220
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,560
 The magic effect did not work and I authentically lost their ring in a sea of rings

221
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,080
 Jar you have like a mason jar of rings, right?

222
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,960
 Yes, and I pull the ring out of a pile of rings and it's their ring on a string

223
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,520
 Yeah, and due to a certain design of the ring the ring did not come up with a string

224
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
 and

225
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,760
 Legitimately a pile of rings. Yep

226
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,500
 Good and as reminded of what Penn says about magic, which is when match tricks go wrong boys

227
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 it's just a waste of everyone's time and

228
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,640
 And now I feel

229
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,960
 Less emboldened as an ogre staring him down because now he's calling you out on an actual

230
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
 He has a point very rarely

231
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,560
 Our magicians held to account

232
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,440
 Strictly by the success of their tricks and yet here I am

233
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,400
 Costing this company money

234
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,660
 For failing to do my job. Are they refunding his money? They are

235
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:54,140
 That they are they are funding his drinks there. Let's make this loud man happy enough that he will go away

236
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,000
 They're we're funding it before he was giving any details

237
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,160
 They didn't care or want the details didn't even care why he didn't like spellbound

238
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,940
 They just be said I did not enjoy spell and I went off

239
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,980
 They said okay, and then while she was trying to work it out on her computer. He just started rallying it off

240
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,360
 Yeah, yeah, he slowed her down telling her the things that were wrong with him

241
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,080
 So then I get called to my customer service desk and it's the one right next to him

242
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
 I don't get called across the room. I get called

243
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,840
 This makes me so happy and that's that was Penn's response that's exactly that's all pended

244
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,680
 Penta's laughs and said this is great

245
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,960
 He's right he's right that's right

246
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:45,700
 And now I'm sitting next to him and I basically I'm like now I'm like like ready to give the sup chin to him

247
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,440
 Cuz like yes, it's me whatever

248
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,560
 Now I'm dressed to go to the gym. I'm basically dressed like the way I like to be

249
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,620
 The whale of the chat slowly I turned

250
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:07,080
 And so I'm in like, you know t-shirt or my my my flat cap I got headphones around my neck and I'm in

251
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
 you know, you know sweatpants and

252
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,640
 He just doesn't recognize me straight up just looks

253
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:21,680
 Just looks at me and goes no and I'm staring at him right like a little angrily staring at him. I'm making eyes with him

254
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,780
 He he doesn't realize this but he's already been having a conversation with you

255
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,640
 he interprets my staring eyes as

256
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,960
 Boy, doesn't it suck to be stuck in customer service right now

257
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,980
 So I give him a glare and he looks at me sees my glare and puts his hand on my shoulder and says

258
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,360
 We'll get through this

259
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
 Oh

260
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,360
 Multiple levels that we'll get through this is working on my brain. I

261
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,760
 Like scob smacked. I am speechless. I am spinning

262
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:16,480
 This is wild that's fucking wild this is the most magical thing that happened on that cruise

263
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,360
 Was like I am so like

264
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,920
 I want to tell no one right? Like this is so embarrassing. I don't know if I could tell my wife about this

265
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,320
 Right

266
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,900
 And then I'm like and then I literally have to go to the 19th deck and take a walk. That's what I do

267
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,600
 I literally go like I got a harpooners run stand by

268
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,360
 Man the harpoons this guy looks like a jumper

269
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,640
 I'm like all the woulda coulda shoulda's and everything else and then all sudden going like but you did fuck up your trick

270
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,760
 And I was really spinning and then I was like, oh, huh, I'm gonna tell Penn and Penn

271
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,520
 Tell pencil this goes. Yeah, I could tell nobody I can tell, you know 20,000 people and

272
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,640
 And then Penn just left his ass off and then I just been processing it but I just was like

273
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,360
 Really? I really ran myself with a ringer for like a good couple hours and I thought I was like I

274
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,500
 Was really like I'm quitting magic. I'm

275
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,040
 People people don't this is behind the curtain right here

276
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,320
 This is more behind the curtain than we usually go when Matt messes up like a patreon post or something. He beats himself up

277
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,520
 Matt does not like making mistakes on things especially ones that he could have avoided

278
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,440
 It's so the fact that this guy is being an asshole and you're like in your mind. You're like, oh this fucking jerk

279
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,320
 He's being a he's being a jerk and he's being a jerk about my thing and that sucks and man

280
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,600
 This guy's really being a jerk shit. He said something that's correct. I I did mess that up

281
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,760
 And he is just he is correct. I don't have a firm fuck that guy

282
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,800
 I'm great at telling someone else fuck that guy, right?

283
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,920
 You're like this guy did this to me. I'm great at like getting in my friends faces and be like hey fuck that guy

284
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,760
 You know and really getting the person to like really shed it, you know, yeah, it does not work on me. I cannot do it

285
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:30,520
 Can't do it. I'm the child of a public defender. I literally like, you know, it's like oh my god that murder my brain goes

286
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,380
 Well, it came from somewhere. What was his childhood? Like who did what he do? You know, like I this is what I grew up

287
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,360
 Seeing the three-dimensionality of life's horrors through the New Jersey criminal justice system

288
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,840
 I always try to give someone credit even if they're being full dickheads to me, right?

289
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,180
 Oh, if I can take a part of it as blame, I will shovel that blame onto my own shoulders

290
00:23:52,180 --> 00:24:00,200
 Speaking of taking blame. I don't think we discussed how did the rest of the ring trick go after the mechanism didn't work?

291
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,520
 Great question

292
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,980
 What is the solution there I literally have to go in front of the audience and peel through all the rings to

293
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,440
 And find it and return it to them

294
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,720
 oh

295
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,280
 So you don't just like take the table off stage and hand it to a stage hand like with the couple and be like

296
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:27,060
 Help these people find their ring. I now yeah, I have no stage hands on spellbound on my regular

297
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,560
 If I was on the main stage of her cruise ship I could do exactly what you just said

298
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,320
 But yeah, it's spelled like here's the couple whose ring I just lost please find the ring for them and send them back to their

299
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,100
 See, man, I really only have one question Matt. Yes. I really have one question

300
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,760
 After you have to scatter the rings out and go through them bit by bit

301
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,480
 Yeah

302
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,200
 And slowly but surely disseminate the junk rings and find the one when you do finally find it

303
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,160
 Do you at least give a tada?

304
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,960
 Did you do a flourish when you found?

305
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 Don't do that Paul I don't do that

306
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,400
 I'm gonna say missed opportunity missed opportunity. I

307
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,780
 It's funny. I I think it's cuz I you know came up through Penn and Teller Penn and Teller don't have

308
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:24,200
 Women we're relaunching the show and we were working with Jeff McBride and Jeff McBride was you know is a famous magician his own

309
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,800
 Right a huge huge magician runs a magic school here in Las Vegas the most famous one of the most famous magic schools in the world

310
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
 Jacob no Paul rather

311
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,640
 This I don't think I could be more accurate this metaphor even though this will go over most of the audience's head

312
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,120
 He is the Sharna Halpern of magic

313
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:50,840
 Yeah, yeah, Jeff is yes Jeff McBride is yeah one-on-one ratio Sharna Halpern ran Improv Olympic and all the things that okay bitch

314
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,940
 About Sharna about people bitch about Jeff about and all the power that trying to had Jeff has

315
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,520
 great

316
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,520
 but he he they he was hired as a consultant to help relaunch the show post-pandemic and I was in the room with him and

317
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,440
 At one point they were doing it going over a trick and

318
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,540
 Jeff McBride goes well, what's your out on that and this is an out is like magicians basically like what's your thing?

319
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,520
 If you miss it you go back and you get it later. Uh-huh. What's up that fucks up? What's your what you're out?

320
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,380
 Yeah, and they both turned to Jeff and go like we don't have outs

321
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:27,000
 And he goes what do you mean you don't you don't have it out for this he goes no we don't have outs we don't use outs

322
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,440
 Because you live outside any tricks and they go no

323
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,540
 It works or it doesn't they go. What do you think? Oh, we just move along

324
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,320
 Right and this made Jeff laughs like so hard

325
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,960
 He's like, what do you think you don't have outs and I was laughing I go, you know, it's funny Jeff

326
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
 I haven't worked with them there for years. They don't

327
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,320
 And a teller don't yeah use outs

328
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,680
 They just go like that didn't work and they go what that's next next and so

329
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,880
 I

330
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,440
 Comedically point out how much authentic sweat was piling up on my forehead as I

331
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,080
 Went through the rings in a jar until I found their ring and then said I could try to do something magical

332
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 Here to try to make this an out and make this not a mistake

333
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,160
 But I think just funny to let you guys know that I made a mistake and we're moving on and I got a big laugh

334
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,840
 And then I finished the show strong with two more effects. And so I thought I had recovered the show as a whole

335
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,400
 Beautifully well, and I think was proved 95% of your audience did think that oh

336
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,960
 That's because you have not heard about the people that were in line behind that the rest of the crowd was in line behind Matt

337
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,640
 You can they also didn't recognize him, but they had things to say. No, you can't make all everybody happy

338
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,280
 It's just what it is. Oh man. No time. It was on the same ship

339
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,200
 We were doing I did end up doing a show for two people and it was so awkward

340
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,760
 So the next group that came oh my show for two people. I said listen, you're doing shows at the you're doing tricks at the bar

341
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,760
 I go let me just switch off with you at the bar. We'll just do all of our tricks. Oh, yeah

342
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,360
 They go great

343
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
 And so we he and I

344
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,920
 entertained two people and two people left over at the bar going back and forth doing tricks and end up getting real kind of energy in

345
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,920
 There's really fun. And I love all sudden. I was like man. I love doing magic behind the bar. This is really fun

346
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,400
 Yeah, those people complained they didn't get the theatrical experience and got money for fuckers

347
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,200
 They got the intimate special one-of-a-kind thing and they're like I didn't like that

348
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:28,880
 It's just cuz they can this cruise ships. I'm gonna say this is cruise ship. This is this is that is that is these are the people

349
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,040
 That are on the cruise ship already that I like that's the thing is you you are just this is gonna sound like I'm being mean

350
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,320
 To you, but I'm not

351
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,000
 This is the thing where you are just in their mind one of the things that's like a box that they can tick

352
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,680
 They're like, yep. I think I get my money back on that one. I'm pretty sure I can get my money back on this like

353
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,960
 Oh, I got I ate at this restaurant. It's a little more than eating the buffet, but you know, the steak was overcooked

354
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,540
 So I'm gonna go ahead and get my money back on that man

355
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,360
 I never had to go through hearing or seeing any kind of critique on my

356
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,840
 Stuff it shows when we were doing well

357
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,600
 Again so again because I'm part of this boutique experience right through the Magic Castle. It's not a regular thing

358
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,440
 So on a regular ship, I am ushered on through the entertainment, you know, I'm greeted by the you know, the the the entertainment director

359
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,240
 I'm handled with my you know tech and all the run-throughs and all this other stuff and I will never hear anything on those ships

360
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,000
 So the regular ships that I do this is a premium

361
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,360
 Experience. Yes. It's the only thing people can pay for an additional cost. Yes, and therefore they cop people who that makes a fucking difference

362
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,400
 They you know that kind of stuff. Oh sure. Yeah, and so you deal with all kinds of and oh

363
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,200
 I didn't even think about you still get casino comps on the ocean. Yes, you can't get away from get the casino comps and

364
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,440
 Once my first day once I'm ushered onto the ship

365
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,500
 that's the last time I see an entertainment director until the end of the ship from then on I am under the

366
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,280
 jurisdiction of the restaurant manager and catering Oh

367
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:05,160
 Yes, and those people are not an entertainment and so they know they tell you things very plainly the way no entertainment director ever would

368
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,720
 So that's how I found out about the theater experience thing

369
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,440
 No

370
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,360
 And I like an entertainment director an agent nobody else nobody in the entertainment world is telling you about that at all

371
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,720
 No, and even what time I end up not not without a lot of sugar

372
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
 I did know not doing one of my five shows when I supposed to because I was told

373
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,160
 By someone else that it was not gonna be for like another half hour

374
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
 So I went okay

375
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,560
 I went I left the theater and I got yelled at yell that like I was

376
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,040
 Like a like a bartender like like working for them

377
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,720
 Yeah, and it was like looking at them like what I'm like, I why are you you cannot?

378
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
 Like why are you yelling at me? And right I?

379
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,800
 Was like I said I said I said just as you know, I wait till it calm down. I gave it a beat

380
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,320
 I did my show I went back to them and I said just so you know, I never leave

381
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,040
 The room unless it's set for a show. So the moment you want to show you can have it

382
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,440
 I said all I've done this entire week is say yes

383
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,560
 I've never said no to a single thing. So you tell me the shows are I'm doing six shows tonight

384
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,720
 I'm doing four shows tonight. I'm doing two shows. I'm doing a show for two people

385
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,360
 I'm doing a show for 30 people all I have said the entire time was yes

386
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:23,560
 So please don't treat me like I'm some guy sneaking off to like slack and right

387
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,480
 Yeah, that's not what I'm doing

388
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,920
 I said so you can just shoot me a text saying need you now and you will have a show that starts in a minute

389
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,360
 And I was like, that's all you need to know

390
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,420
 And it's just like you can't

391
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,920
 Basically what I couldn't say was like you can't yell at a performer and expect them to be very good at this

392
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,480
 right

393
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,680
 You're lucky you're talking to someone who has an experienced bartender and experienced catering waiter and experienced mater day

394
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,960
 Yeah, you've been in that you've been in that world long enough to know what it is. But boy, that's what I was

395
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,020
 By the way, it's somebody who's gone through enough therapy to not like scream back at her

396
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,720
 She's yelling at you in the first place. Yeah

397
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Lindsay Bashir is right. I said I was a waiter and I cried

398
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:15,300
 Tears from the eyes, but I was like and this is all you know, and this is it's it's just a strange thing

399
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,000
 It's a strange gig that I looked into it's a weird bit

400
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,140
 and the strange bit is is it pays slightly better than the

401
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,560
 Than if I was a main stage performer performing for all thousand people at the same time in the theater, right doing two shows in a cruise

402
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,920
 What I'm doing because I'm working seven nights a week and doing three or four sets a night actually pays better

403
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,880
 So even though this is shittier and it's less glorious and I don't feel like an entertainer as much as I feel like a high-end

404
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,000
 bartender waiter

405
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,520
 Okay, it's still worth it to do it for my family to do to do the experience. Yeah, man

406
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:56,200
 I mean at least you feel like a high-end bartender. It's true. I'm gonna talk to you could could be a low-end bartender

407
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,400
 I'll tell you who loves a good low-end bartender and by that I mean bartending on their ends and that's the following sponsor

408
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,100
 Today's show is brought to you by

 Sorry, I brought the jokers of magic dates and then where did it go? Oh, here we go

411
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,300
 That's right. Today's show is brought to you by Brian brushwood and Justin Robert Young's greatest hits album volume two

412
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,660
 Hey everybody, it's Brian. Hey, I'm here with the

413
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,200
 scams cool

414
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,520
 Look, I know I know what you want. I know what you want to trick your friends. You want to trick your neighbors?

415
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,320
 You want to trick your kids? Well, you can't

416
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,720
 I'm about to show you a secret. This is a deep dark secret

417
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,120
 Picture it

418
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,720
 1958 a

419
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,940
 Young American sailor just got done with a tour of near Cambodia

420
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:03,240
 He decides that he's gonna go for a swim. Yeah

421
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,560
 so he puts on some fins a

422
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,360
 snorkel mask and dives

423
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:16,440
 He dives just outside of one of the Cambodian islands as deep as he can go with a single breath

424
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,900
 While he's down there in the ocean depths. He comes upon

425
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,880
 a mollusk

426
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,080
 inside this mollusk he later discovers a pearl a

427
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,680
 Perfect pearl or what he assumes to be a perfect pearl

428
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,980
 So he takes that pearl out of the mollusk and

429
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:46,880
 Thinks on it. He's looking at this beautiful gem that was created inside the gut of this squiggly little animal that lives

430
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,040
 inside of a collapsed shell

431
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,720
 He thinks to himself. I bet if I made a bunch of these I

432
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,960
 Could really make a business

433
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,800
 Sure enough

434
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,380
 He looks into the deed for that area of beach and it just happens to be for sale

435
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,760
 And the price of that beach happens to be almost exactly

436
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,200
 His four months furlough salary that he was receiving from a GI bill

437
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,600
 So he decides to take a risk he buys that small piece of beach off of Cambodia

438
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,920
 and he starts seeding all of these

439
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,120
 mollusks all around this seabed and

440
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,000
 creating pearls and

441
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,640
 He turns this into a business

442
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,520
 It takes a couple of months for the pearls to be created

443
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,920
 He brings them up

444
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,560
 takes the pearl

445
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,780
 Puts many of them right back into the water. They keep breeding

446
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:57,680
 He's making conditions down there that are very affable to how they live. He feeds these mollusks

447
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,440
 He's got a real farm going

448
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,080
 It's incredible

449
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,440
 By 1963 he has an empire built on this small island

450
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,800
 He's the king. He's ruling this place with his trade in pearls

451
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,940
 He can't believe his luck. How lucky can you get the pearl magnate of?

452
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,200
 South Cambodia this guy he's got everything he needs

453
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,520
 But then he finds one of these mollusks

454
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:41,960
 Has left its normal shell and gone into a very fancy spiral one

455
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,400
 He crafts this spiral shell

456
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,520
 and he looks inside and

457
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,140
 He pulls out the mollusks that he's seeded and sure enough

458
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,480
 There's a pearl in there more perfect than any other pearl

459
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,240
 He keeps this shell and he keeps reseeding it over and over again

460
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,600
 and

461
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
 that shell

462
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,940
 Becomes the new holy grail for his enterprise

463
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,380
 he can't get better pearls than what he finds in this shell and

464
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,840
 that's because

465
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,440
 this man

466
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,500
 after six years of farming pearls has found

467
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,320
 the world's

468
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,440
 greatest conk

469
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:42,640
 I am so mad for so many reasons

470
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
 I

471
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:53,400
 Don't care what you do

472
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:02,680
 Nick in the chat says I'm mad at myself for invested. I wasn't this I honestly didn't even know where it was going for a

473
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,480
 Long time. Oh you really I thought I was gonna make a pearl necklace joke for a minute and then I finally went

474
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,200
 Oh, yeah world's greatest. No world's greatest conk. Yeah

475
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,520
 That's funny Matt and I both knew you're going there before you did yeah

476
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,720
 That was a true cliff-diver

477
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,900
 Thank You Leon

478
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,580
 Constant fools because we're stupid cunks fools because we're human

479
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:34,660
 By the way, they just did a banger of a new episode on the Ponzi scheme. Oh

480
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,520
 Yeah, I've got to listen. Oh and world's greatest. I'm saving it. Yeah. Oh good. Yeah, he's only got the first episode up, right?

481
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,280
 I mean, I think it's a one. I believe it's just a one-off. Oh, it's just a one-off. Okay, gotcha

482
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,300
 Yeah. Yeah. Oh good. I've got a I've got plane flights this week

483
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,800
 I need some good shows

484
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,140
 But yeah

485
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:02,720
 I'm sorry Paul has distracted us from everything that we might have been thinking about

486
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,240
 Being a suffering cruise ship

487
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,920
 But now all I can think about is world's greatest cock when I speak with such glowing enthusiasm for my upcoming jokers of magic gigs you now

488
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
 You really understand why?

489
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,640
 Really just I'm so excited to do real shows for real people and real environment away from that that structure. Yeah, that's a hard structure

490
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,920
 cruise ships are

491
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
 They can be a nightmare. It's

492
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,520
 Their own this is their own world. There's just a strange that's there on the world. Yeah, I don't I don't begrudge it

493
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,440
 I don't I think I think it keeps a lot of people employed in a lot of levels

494
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,520
 A lot of brother I did for me. Yeah, I know I had a conversation this week with an old friend of mine

495
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,560
 who works for Royal Caribbean and and that's what he was saying he was because he's kind of the

496
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,760
 When new cast members and new entertainers are coming in

497
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,400
 he's the one that's dealing with a lot of these these new people and

498
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,240
 He's like yeah

499
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:01,400
 The first two three weeks is just me telling them to trust me that it's all gonna work out this way

500
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,960
 It's all a dumb system that they don't understand yet, but eventually they'll understand the dumb system and it'll be fine

501
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and yeah, it's just like it's this whole different thing. That's not like anything else in especially not an entertainment

502
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,160
 Yeah, it's it's you know

503
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,740
 and so actually when I'm talking about with with Penn is that like

504
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:28,240
 For other things it makes a lot of sense, but in in entertainment you already already you already speak a currency of immediate gratification, right?

505
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,120
 You showed up in the theater you laugh you applaud you leave with a smile on your face or

506
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,400
 Or those things don't happen and you very much understand that those things didn't happen and you need to make adjustment, right?

507
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,680
 You need to figure things out

508
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,120
 So you don't need this additional

509
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,760
 Threat of a future feedback loop that's going to hurt your reputation down the line

510
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,400
 As you talk from one person to another I don't know

511
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,240
 I mean you thought the rest of the show went really well is what you said

512
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,480
 I mean, it sounds like you might have needed this extra feedback. I don't know

513
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,600
 Maybe he just didn't think you look you looked ashamed of yourself enough

514
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,200
 By the end of the show

515
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,040
 Jessica Jane Peterson has been doing the the Lord's work. She's trying to get me on booked on Disney cruises, right?

516
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,560
 that's that's her goal is to get me booked on Disney and

517
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,600
 By we have the same agent and

518
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,780
 So an opportunity came up at at Disney

519
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:31,800
 He knew that there was a goal and he fired off my stuff to Disney and he fired off my usual stuff

520
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:39,760
 Just sent them what he sends everyone. Yeah is not what you want to do to sell stuff to Disney Disney now

521
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,920
 and so

522
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,840
 And so I got

523
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,120
 Rejected I got I got no he does not seem like he is he is gonna be a good fit on the ship

524
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,680
 What's that opening monologue you do about all of your experiences at Disney parks that I think really might have turned him off?

525
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,160
 That one experience, oh you guys like Disney do you

526
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:20,880
 This is this is way before Splash Mountain this is more like Trash Mountain

527
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,640
 And so

528
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,240
 You know like I I was like they said the feedback and I was like, oh well if you set them my usual tape

529
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,740
 Then yeah, I agree with I agree

530
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:40,400
 You had a you had a different thing ready to go I don't know I did a cleaner show

531
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,000
 With children in the theater

532
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,120
 At Dickens in Delaware that I had an hour-long tape of that. It wasn't 45, but it was certainly more now

533
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,620
 I still did my straightest jacket escape, which is which is one of their notes of like you could not cannot do that

534
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,920
 I'm right. Okay. Well then fuck them

535
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,680
 You don't want to work for them. Anyway

536
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,280
 But if you did

537
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,740
 My suggestion going forward Matt would that would be that you adopt a fursona. Ah

538
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,820
 I would say I heard fursona and the answer is yes

539
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,720
 Sona I see Jessica Jane, you know, and she's able to very quickly just

540
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,240
 slide into

541
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,000
 Disney Princess mode

542
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,880
 You need to go full sully and you need a full furry outfit

543
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,880
 Head to toe listening go on and and that needs to be the character that you create for these various

544
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:52,440
 Particular child-friendly Disney s gigs. You need a persona magic routine. Why would Matt dressing up as a commercial airline pilot?

545
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,080
 Excite these children

546
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:02,240
 No, why would they care about that at all monsters already sullys that I landed a plane at a river

547
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,600
 Yeah, yeah. I know but a love to do magic as sully. I would love to do it

548
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,120
 I would do that so fast as sully that the be really funny to do it as the airline pilot

549
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,440
 Yeah, it would be the hero of the Hudson. Yeah

550
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,800
 The magic of sully sullenberger. I go to do a levitation and a bird strike hits

551
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:33,520
 This child will be in the Hudson and I was gonna land this I'm gonna land this

552
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,120
 Routine in the Hudson, but yeah, I think you could do you could do a full

553
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,880
 You know and you could talk with you could talk with Harry the Gorilla Gition because he's got experience with that

554
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,560
 He's basically taking on a fauna for magic. So, you know, I

555
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,040
 Didn't watch a recent

556
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,200
 Paul I don't know if you've been keeping up with fool us

557
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:00,860
 But I watched a recent fool us episode and there was a fella on there that I laughed really hard at his routine

558
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,120
 Before I realized what was happening

559
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,800
 He does like like film work and stuff and he came out and did a very interesting avant-garde

560
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,040
 Magical routine was this the body had a man? Yes. Yes boy that routine

561
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,640
 I was sitting there looking at it going like how the fuck does this guy travel a buffalo head and then I realized that he

562
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,640
 Just doesn't this was a one-off thing

563
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,600
 That was the strangest thing we had ever done unfool us. Yep, and

564
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,400
 When it was over, we had no better explanation

565
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,560
 Penn and teller didn't know like how to even bust what they were watching, right?

566
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
 But I don't think you fooled us

567
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,520
 Also, I don't know what you just did

568
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:50,960
 Cool. There's some interactive like film to life elements, which I guess qualify as illusion

569
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,520
 there was there was this whole thing where part of it relied on Brooke going in and out of

570
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,640
 The film. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She was a character

571
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,920
 Yes, and they didn't have anything the outfit that she needed to go in and out to make it really believable and

572
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,920
 Seamless or at least a little more seamless

573
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,760
 It was close, but I we ended up doing a ball was there

574
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,320
 We end up doing like heavy lifting by we I mean the production team the production team did a lot of work to get that

575
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
 Thing to get to get that to where it was

576
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:32,800
 They ran through it at least for at least three times so there's a lot and and then the ending I like four times

577
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,300
 There's everyone in the audience feel like they're just tripping balls. Yeah. No, that was just it. Everybody was like what the fuck is going on

578
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,560
 I mean, I just watched it on TV and I was still tripping but nobody hated it

579
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,120
 It was it was interesting enough that everybody was still polite and chill with it

580
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,520
 So, you know, that's what the guy after Matt and line said to his customer service representative about Matt show. Mm-hmm

581
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,760
 I hated it. Hey, everybody's polite enough

582
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,080
 Head was interesting. I wish I was wearing a big buffalo head while I was sitting in customer service

583
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,280
 This is what I'm telling you Matt you get you need a second fursona

584
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,320
 So that when things go south on the ship, you can just put on a mask and fuck all these fools

585
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,980
 Yeah, I don't know. I'm just sully I

586
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,280
 Had to come up with a unique character

587
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,200
 Sully Sullenberger the

588
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,080
 Magic performing airplane pilot is pretty good character kind of ridiculous actually

589
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,300
 Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, so I'll try to try the Sullenberger thing

590
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,040
 I did I did think of what we talked about moving the baseball cards to Marvel characters, which I think that would work

591
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
 all right, right and

592
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,300
 You know

593
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,380
 JJ, of course, you're still like no we can figure it out

594
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,080
 We just have to you know, whatever and I'm just like I don't know if this is worth chasing

595
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:56,240
 Well, did you just hear yesterday's big announcement from them know how they're doubling down with AI

596
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,480
 Who I don't even know what them you're talking about Disney, okay, it's really it's fucking weird

597
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,280
 Because they had a lawsuit pending

598
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,140
 Against a lot of these AI companies

599
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:20,200
 Where they were they were winning in court a lot of times about misuse of their and misappropriation of their characters

600
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:28,040
 And they have turned on a fucking dime and not only have they decided to allow these companies full access to their characters

601
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,560
 But they are making investments in the millions and billions of dollars into said companies

602
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,400
 So yeah, I mean this somebody got in somebody's bossy bossy just put one up in the chat here

603
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,120
 It says Disney's got about a one billion dollar investment with a B with open AI

604
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,920
 It's bring hundreds of Disney characters to its generative AI platforms, right?

605
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:57,020
 So that is a that is a shift that is a policy shift over a huge shift a huge shift and it's not it doesn't bode

606
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,920
 Well, but it's also just one more thing where we're just propping up this bullshit that doesn't do anything

607
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,560
 Except let Sully fuck Mike Wazowski in the ass

608
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,280
 You know like oh great

609
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,440
 Yeah

610
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,720
 Yeah, how how fun I get to watch Cinderella and essentially like Pixar has always had like a

611
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,600
 Not even a hand in relationship with Disney, you know

612
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,640
 Yeah, and Pixar just announced or do they decide to go the other way and they went back to doing a hand-drawn animation

613
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,920
 The next the next the next movie coming out Sandra on and I think they're right to do it

614
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,760
 like I

615
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,920
 Here's here's the thing. Is that like?

616
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:45,520
 In terms of like not trying to be doom and goomba AI, but also not liking some of the things I'm seeing I came up with

617
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,680
 a metaphor

618
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,160
 For myself were like I consider it like cooking

619
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:56,560
 Okay, like okay figured out how to cook everything by machine and then our lives we see things that are by

620
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,080
 Cooked by machine and we don't pay a lot for it and we don't care that much about it, right?

621
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,440
 So we get fast food burgers from from you know

622
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,840
 There's places and then it has not stopped us from craving better burgers

623
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,520
 And then we've only turned around and respected people who are doing things more bespoke to make food taste good

624
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:22,080
 So we we regularly pay people to do the expert things that at a level that we just simply don't want for machines

625
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:29,120
 Right and bespoke nachos are the superior nachos way to kick with torpedo my point Jacob

626
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:37,840
 No, no, but I mean this is like I think like yes great all these people are gonna be allowed to make all of their own

627
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,680
 Disney movies and all that's gonna make us do is not give a shit or want to pay for those things

628
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,200
 I'm not pay good money for those things

629
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,040
 We might still consume it like we do all consume fast food

630
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:56,600
 But we won't sit around raving about how we need to pay good money for this shit. It's clearly going to become

631
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:05,640
 overall a devaluation of all of it, but I don't they're not I don't think they see that yet and I don't know I

632
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,600
 Don't know that matters. So there's also a part of me and this is real

633
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,280
 There's a part of me that's thinking like maybe it needs to be devalued a little bit

634
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:21,640
 Absolutely. Well, the whole thing is just strange. Anyway, it has gotten away from itself, but

635
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,040
 Yeah, the descendant of Walt Disney is always speaking up at shareholders meetings

636
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,800
 Talking about how they'd be more generous and how they're portraying all these other things. It's it's a weird time

637
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,680
 Yeah

638
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,480
 Because all these things only in only in regards to Disney though. Everything else is going smoothly

639
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,160
 But for Disney, it's an odd time in history right now, but that was a very freaky turnabout

640
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,960
 from a huge creative company and I think you're okay for not

641
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,140
 Being accepted by a company whose standards are clearly in limbo right now

642
00:51:54,140 --> 00:52:01,120
 Yeah, I mean look I have you know over the years where I almost got a job at ESPN and ESPN was bought by Disney or I?

643
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,840
 my you know, my kids go to Disneyland for free because my

644
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,520
 Mother-in-law's a retired employee

645
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:15,320
 You know, don't get me wrong. I do a lot of back-and-forth at this about my relationship to the Disney as a company and investment

646
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,320
 I mean I have we all do

647
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,120
 My Toy Story stuff down there and you know, yeah

648
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:28,280
 Yeah, I mean I loved Aladdin and Little Mermaid and Lion King. Although that was very formative stuff

649
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:34,800
 Oh, we used to go to Disneyland Park, but we'd go there like 10 11 12 times a year easily

650
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,440
 We'd just pop over there and just do a day and it's incredible

651
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,560
 Yeah, you know like that that experience in those parks is incredible, right? It's expensive and incredible

652
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,280
 That's the thing is now it's now it's fucking expensive

653
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:55,440
 Expensive now. It's like holy shit. What are you guys doing prohibitive? Yeah, we go, you know for for free and it's expensive

654
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,360
 Yeah, like like just just they make you add on all the stuff that pay for all the extra extra stuff

655
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,320
 You don't just want like dinner. Yeah, it's like get a good dinner

656
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,680
 Yeah

657
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:14,320
 But I'm saying like this is this this is what this is what's gonna happen with AI is it's just gonna make it's just gonna make

658
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:22,920
 The the waters muddier and it's gonna make real creators stand out and because it's gonna be a relief

659
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,040
 More than just it's difficult

660
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,760
 I'm sure you guys are doing the same thing like like scrolling on YouTube or on any social media thing on Instagram or whatever

661
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:37,800
 Oh, it's so crazy just in this last couple of weeks there every every videos like it seems like the majority of the videos that

662
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,120
 Are coming through now are AI something. Yeah, and and if we weren't

663
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,080
 media savvy

664
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:51,120
 We won't even be questioning it. Well, like I saw one the other day that was you know, some some left-leaning

665
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:57,460
 Political organization put out a photo of Trump with the with the wind blowing his hair in a certain way

666
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,000
 That made it look like he was completely bald and had a big comb over now

667
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,960
 Donald Trump has famously has hair that looks like cotton candy made of piss

668
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,000
 I'm not defending Donald Trump's hair, but I looked at this picture for about half a second was like this is photoshopped

669
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,120
 Somebody is somebody's photoshopped this picture to make him to make him look worse than he does

670
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:22,620
 Also, why waste your fucking time making Donald Trump look worse than he actually looks you don't need to it's but like

671
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,440
 What are you doing? And I see that I go instantly we go like well, that's fake

672
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,480
 moving on but not everything the scary thing is like you've got like videos of

673
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,960
 People falling over and dropping shit and then you go. Oh, okay

674
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,600
 They've got an extra arm or or oh that that little piece came out of nowhere

675
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,480
 I but it won't be long before you can't discern

676
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,140
 No, and that's the dangerous thing is that they're gonna use it as a propaganda tool

677
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:55,100
 That's why they're pushing it so hard is to try and get it to better itself to the point where you can't discern

678
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,200
 truth from fiction and then and then

679
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,400
 like

680
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,800
 I've seen I've seen good damn bands on this. So people are selling online

681
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:12,620
 You can do the print model of a ring that you put it on your hand and it's an extra finger, right? Oh

682
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:20,160
 It's great. You make sure you wear that if you're going to protest or if you're gonna be in any kind of compromising situation

683
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,720
 Or just wear it day to day and any photos taken of you

684
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,640
 You can then point to that and go like it's clear. It's clearly AI

685
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,720
 There's an extra business right digit. Oh

686
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,560
 I love using analog technology to defeat the the AI technology

687
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,960
 But that's also like if you're a murderer, you're gonna start wearing extra fingers

688
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:48,240
 Listen murderers have been ahead of technologies curve for many years. I guess you're right, but jeez, it's scary

689
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,660
 Who else has been ahead of murderers for a long time, maybe not long enough. We'll see that's the following sponsor

690
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,600
 Today's show is brought to you by become your inner champion

691
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,560
 guided meditations by macho man Randy Savage become your inner champion

692
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,940
 Hey, how's it going everybody? I'm so glad you joined me

693
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:19,120
 Let's go ahead and pour ourselves a small glass of chamomile and bring it down to zero

694
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,720
 Yeah, all the way down to zero. That's what I'm talking about. Calm

695
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,120
 Relax yourselves. Okay. Let the tension flow out of your body

696
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,160
 All the way down your toes. Oh, yeah

697
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:41,280
 And then let it slip out through your shoes and into the carpet where it goes away and dissipates completely

698
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,720
 I want you to clear your mind clear your mind

699
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:51,960
 Think about all the little stars in the sky and all the little twinkling lights

700
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,340
 Imagine that you're in a you're in a field and you're laying in the grass

701
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:04,760
 Look good up at the sky and you're seeing nothing but stars. Oh, yeah, just stars everywhere you can look

702
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,400
 There's no stars are twinkling you focus on one

703
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,080
 Star one star

704
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,320
 That you can see

705
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:21,400
 It starts to get bigger and it's bigger and it's glowing and you are getting closer to that star

706
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:27,760
 Closer to that star and it's getting bigger and it's slowly absorbing you

707
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,640
 Becoming one with that star you are that star now

708
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:39,560
 Yeah, you and the star the same thing no difference. We're all made of star stuff

709
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,320
 Even miss Elizabeth made a star stuff. We're all the same. There's no separation. There's no me. There's no you there's just us

710
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,720
 We're all connected in this big crazy world

711
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:57,520
 And we're all here just for a cup of coffee on the planet earth and then poop we zip out of existence

712
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:05,260
 Real fast, huh? Oh, yeah. What happened? What we do? Who do we help? That's all that matters

713
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,760
 Who did we love? I loved miss Elizabeth and cocaine that was all

714
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,260
 For the benefit of you you the people I tell you who I didn't love

715
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,380
 Horkhogan fuck that guy

716
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:30,440
 Those are specifically a great meditation very peaceful

717
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,520
 Okay. Yeah, take it to zero. Okay

718
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,040
 Let's do a little junk versus nerd where Paul score is gonna be zero

719
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:15,200
 Today from winter scoop. I'm sorry not a scooperty a handmade jock versus nerd scoop categories

720
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,840
 Scoopagories is the name of this game Jacob is the game master

721
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:26,500
 There will be six rounds the master will read one word or phrase at a time the player who buzzes in first gets to guess

722
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,080
 What the category? Oh what category all the words connect to it?

723
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:38,380
 so I'm gonna give you a word or a phrase read some words phrases one one word at a time and

724
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,120
 You're gonna tell me what the category is if they get it wrong

725
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:47,320
 The other player gets a free guess before the next one is read it gets easier the more that are read if nobody guesses it

726
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,720
 Correctly Jacob gets to make fun of you for as long as he sees fit Wow

727
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,440
 And as always Jacob wins with a tie. Okay example

728
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,380
 What are we uh example Oh example category

729
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:07,960
 So I would say human touch so you buzz in when you know the category human touch

730
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,080
 magic

731
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,040

 being born yes springsteen

734
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:26,600
 Springsteen album names. Yes, springsteen album names. Yeah, I think I think Paul would have gotten that the next one was born to run

735
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,520
 And the last one was Nebraska

736
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,520
 Okay, all right

737
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:36,480
 Alright, I get it. I get it. Okay. Alright, so that's the game. So here we go. Here's the here's the first real one

738
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,480
 You buzz in when you know it

739
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,840
 Arizona

740
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,320

01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,480
 Utah

743
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,960
 California ding ding Paul Southwest States incorrect Matt you get a free guess

744
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,800
 West of the Mississippi

745
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,080
 Now I'm afraid that's not it either

746
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,920
 Also, that was all the words. So there aren't any more hints to give

747
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,600
 It's uh states that border, Nevada

748
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,320
 States that border Nevada. It's that let's see nobody

749
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,760
 Correctly, Jacob gets to make fun of you for long or as long as he sees fit you guys suck at naming states that border, Nevada

750
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,420
 Okay, that's it. That's enough. This is true. Next one offer

 Improv terminology. Absolutely. That's a point for Matt Donnelly. What's gagging?

 Gagging is like a go for jokes. Yeah go for joking. Yeah. Okay. Yeah
