00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:01,080
 that jacob sent me a link for uh last time we brought up making burgers i was uh can't smashing

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,400
 can't smashing some burgers for my kids and my youngest likes himself a pretzel bun so i get like

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,140
 a fancy i get like nice pretzel buns from the uh from from a supermarket and then youngest has

25
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,260
 excellent taste so then i get like a nice like kind of like a brioche style bun for my other

26
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,440
 kid who doesn't like pretzel buns he normally just takes a regular hamburger regular just

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
 usually gets a regular hamburger and then he gets a regular hamburger and then he gets a regular hamburger

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 bun but he's the only one eating it so i'll buy like a roll you know and um and he's eating it and

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:41,120
 i said uh you don't you don't like the fancy bun do you and he goes dad i'm an american

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,640
 there it is i want no fucking brioche bun

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:49,960

 my i demand that my bread have a clown on it

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:09,840
 wonder has to be in the title it has to be just the most bleached i need it yeah i need to be

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,940
 so preserved yes like mold cannot grow on it no i want my hamburger bun to have been made in 1987

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,280
 ah i wanted to have been sitting that's when they were still good oh they were good preserved

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,200
 under salt

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,600
 they were so good then it's like those mcdonald's buns with that exact same weird white spot on the

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:40,140
 bottom of all of them oh classic classic consistency out are you out get out of my

40
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,440
 house i don't know how many decades it's been since i had a mcdonald's hamburger clearly it's

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:52,960
 been a minute yeah uh and uh jacob i know you you've long not been a fan of the southwest general

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
 seating procedure

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,100
 we've documented no i i have not been and it seems like i might be finally getting my way

44
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,020
 you might be but in the meantime you know as someone i don't mind it i i don't i like it i

45
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,320
 i love it a lot even though they started even though they started charging for bags it's still

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,840
 cheaper to check bags on southwest than any other airline and so i still yep fly southwest because

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,580
 it's still like 35 bucks and i just had a long conversation uh last week about uh airlines

48
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,200
 because we were talking about like airline uh credit cards

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,120
 and for her band and for for all of her gigs and everything and all the travel that she does

50
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,740
 yeah and and we we ended up uh because we've been using southwest and we were like let's look at

51
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,320
 these other airlines let's look at the other cards and everything and nope southwest that's

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,860
 just where we that's where we stayed man i'm telling you you've got the major hub there in

53
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:53,260
 vegas and that was what i got weaned on having to go out to jersey i had to not fly southwest from

54
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,520
 here

55
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,580
 there was no southwest from here to jersey no there's not it was out very disturbing

56
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,760
 baltimore i think i went on united i went united both ways and i was just like oh i don't like this

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:15,400
 i do not care for this i do not care for this united stuff at all i am uh getting online in

58
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,260
 chicago to fly back home uh here from after doing my corporate gig uh-huh and uh it is um it is

59
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,160
 tight quarters in uh

60
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,320
 oh uh oh i'm blanking on o'hare and i i'm blanking because i should uh side note i drove like hell to

61
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,760
 the wrong airport uh i went to oh that's the worst and the only thing that the only thing that was

62
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,680
 good was that you know i had rented a car but i since i do have checked bags what i like to do

63
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,400
 is like to pull up the curbside rush up the curbside check-in oh i like this move yes check

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,000
 my bags then return my car rental car and i'm not lugging all of my bags through the airport

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,760
 uh yes taking my carry-on

66
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,240
 because there's a secret that most airports don't want you to know and that's that they can't tow your

67
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,740
 car instantly they can threaten it they can threaten to find it they can yell about it a lot

68
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:13,040
 they can do that they can't tow it instantly so they were like trying to check my bags at at midway

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,640
 and the woman is making a very confused face and i'm panicking because as she takes longer i'm

70
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,960
 looking to see making sure i'm not getting eyed for a fine with my rental car and uh and and she

71
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,020
 goes uh you i don't know what's going on i've never gotten this message before i brought this

72
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,280
 guy over he doesn't get the message before i think you have to go inside and my brain went

73
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,980
 no i don't i have to go to a different airport my brain is like wait and so i was like somehow

74
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,400
 did i book a ticket home from a different airport and then i realized i landed at a different

75
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,220
 airport and didn't realize it i had just been to chicago three weeks ago for chicago magic lounge

76
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:03,540
 and so my brain was just confusing the two airports and i so i luckily uh uh left with a

77
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,040
 lot of time so i arrived at the proper airport with very little time so i was still rushing

78
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,800
 but i wasn't going to miss my flight or anything i was i was like oh god but i i drove like hell

79
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,100
 between those two airports anyhow so i'm there i'm in southwest and it is tight at o'hare it is

80
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,600
 like you know because southwest makes you line up they usually make you line up along along the thing

81
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,100
 the line they have here is like a very stunted little little uh they don't have the uh the

82
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,320
 square footage no they don't in the airport there so you gotta like basically they've got the square

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:40,020
 footage at midway but not at o'hare and there's a young man well coiffed man from india i believe

84
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:50,680
 with his tall very tall sister or girlfriend i don't know yep and he is either way they were

85
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,080
 making out he is he is beaming

86
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,760
 uncomfortable anger already like he is holding his bags and he is like elbows out and we're in

87
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,880
 tight quarters and you got to do the thing we're like hey what number are you i'm this number sure

88
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,820
 yeah yeah this is what i'm okay with and jacob hates and i'm trying to figure out you know where

89
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:17,040
 to stand or whatever and um you know it's within increments of five it's within increments of five

90
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,080
 uh and i honestly i do have my own pet peeves with it where like some people kind of go

91
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,320
 like if if i'm seven and they're nine and they're in front of me and i go i'm seven they go they'll

92
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,800
 some as a southwest person will confidently go like yeah like meaning like you don't have to

93
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,100
 get in front of me we're both in the same vicinity and i kind of go like close enough and i kind of

94
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,640
 get like no that's the whole fucking point is numbers that's that's some bullshit is lower

95
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,940
 than nine that's some bullshit ass so this guy has got his elbows out and i'm saying i'm a seven

96
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,580
 i'm saying it you know and uh i'm saying it out loud and i get a couple of people give me him and

97
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,500
 his sister wife are not communicating and he is like stewing i can feel him stewing from his back

98
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,740
 you know someone's so angry oh it's the worst doing right goodness and so finally some guy

99
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,540
 comes up like a little late to the party and is like excuse me a1 a1 a1 excuse me a1 yeah yeah and

100
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:17,460
 i was like oh this guy's coming through like lipitor through a vein here and uh uh he is uh

101
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:24,680
 there and the guy goes no no no no no no and he goes yes i'm a1 and he goes no we're all a1

102
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:35,080
 which confused us all i was like i was like we i am spartacus i today we are all a1 no buddy

103
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:44,900
 matt never got off the plane i don't know who paul's been talking to this entire time we live

104
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,840
 here um and so uh uh i was laughing he goes no i've done this before i know how this works i'm a1

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,260
 excuse me i'm definitely up there and he shouts like no like he starts like to open his arms and

106
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,360
 clear everyone back like no one move kind of body language oh that's i feel so bad for this guy

107
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,640
 that's just the worst because he's having a terrible day and he's like and so the guy with

108
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,400
 a1 is like waving like anyone from south was like get get over here please get get over here

109
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:22,440
 whatever and he says the the indian guy says no no no you announced that uh it is open seating

110
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,520
 oh boy and the and the flight attendant's like no yeah when you get on the plane it is open

111
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,240
 seating goes no you announced open seating so it is now open seating meaning that like

112
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,720
 no no no like whatever you want is wherever you want to go no son like no no no you announced

113
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,900
 open seating so now anarchy you know what this means

114
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,020
 i was like listen he's like our podcast is a similar our podcast is a similar rule about dibs

115
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,980
 so i understand what you're saying yeah dibs has been called is what you were saying you're saying

116
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,680
 yeah once once anyone with south us utters open seating the numbers on our on our tickets become

117
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,700
 useless they're right out out the window disqualified nope don't even look at them

118
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,700
 again they're not worth the paper that they were printed on the open seating

119
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,880
 motherfuckers so i take this opportunity to turn a person with a nine and i'm actually with someone

120
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,060
 with a four and a three who don't want to go past this angry person so we're all we're all like our

121
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,220
 little why we're all why not it's like little clutter space together right behind him so i

122
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,660
 decided to announce and interpret what is happening i was like this guy thinks because

123
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,000
 the words open seating were uttered in any capacity our tickets don't matter now

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,380
 oh boy

125
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,500
 oh boy

126
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,780
 i make a point of nothing else matters you gotta get up super early or stay up super late

127
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,080
 yeah and you and you get on that app and you wait for the moment that thing flips over

128
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,040
 and you hit your button to get your good seat availability i'm telling you right now uh mr a1

129
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,740
 and myself we are you know we both fly southwest enough uh that when you you get a list they check

130
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,300
 in for you you're gonna get your a well an a1 is is that's a 50% chance you're gonna get your a1

131
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,100
 50 ticket

132
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,840
 also a1 is i know because like they make sure that like pen gets it uh whenever he flies because he

133
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,640
 can get that one seat that has the he's six seven so there's that one seat you have more more like

134
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,660
 room yeah but that's an extra expense yes and it's and it's yeah and oftentimes it's a privilege

135
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,460
 like it's oftentimes like it's like a anyone traveling often is a1 is like someone who travels

136
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:42,680
 like every day like it's just a it's just a huge right right thing or whatever but i uh but yeah i

137
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,820
 was laughing so angry and he continued to be a show they they got the front row with the extra

138
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,240
 seats so they could feel like they were in first class you know that's all i think it's all they

139
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,940
 were anxious about was getting that first row which means you have to put all your shit behind

140
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:05,720
 you which i hate so i never sit in that row i fucking hate that right um and then uh guys i

141
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,480
 tell you something i was i was haphazardly stick with me as a good person so i says i already checked

142
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,600
 bags i would say if it's a full flight i will gate check my one carry-on bag and only have my book

143
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,500
 bag oh okay and so i get on the plane but i put my book bag up in the carry-on which they is it's

144
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,220
 that's not okay they frown upon that right yeah but here's the thing i do the same thing i do the

145
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,860
 same thing though and i'm ready and i'm ready exactly so i put it up there and i go if they

152
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,800

155
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:23,620
 they still they still gave you the the the thank you hand jay during the flight right i mean that

156
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,720
 person is an american

157
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:35,980
 i was like did you realize what i just did for you like do you understand yeah

158
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,840
 they did not you owe me you i said that's it

159
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,520
 open seating and then i hit a music cue and everybody had to switch seats until the music

160
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,960
 stopped did the guy end up getting on the plane where he was was he was he not stopped what they

161
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,100
 didn't put him back anywhere no they let him on and he was just i mean he got up like probably

162
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,840
 like seven times to get something out of one bag or another and then they were yeah

163
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,780
 he was having a terrible day i see these people in airports and on flights where i'm just like

164
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,400
 i like you were being horrible to everyone around you and i hate you so

165
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,640
 much are these that being said yeah i recognize that you are having just the worst day that a

166
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,980
 human being can have and i'm sorry for you do you think it was because he didn't want to fly

167
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,020
 do you think it was he was a nervous flyer and you know these people they they can't handle

168
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,520
 the loss of control that flying is and so i mean i think i think it factors a lot you know i think

169
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,080
 we have we have uh folks here who work in the airline business but i i've including myself i

170
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,380
 think i'm much more anxious on a plane and i get much more fucking pissed about little shit that

171
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,460
 sure but i find as someone who is with you often uh both in and out of airports

172
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,100
 uh yeah yeah no matt you're definitely much more anxious flying

173
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:01,380
 i can just you don't have to wonder buddy hey i just are i said nothing to that woman that shook

174
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:12,060
 my seat i didn't say you're not a hero sir i just said you're more anxious uh right and so i tell

175
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,180
 myself you're not going to care about this in like 20 minutes right like that's what i tell

176
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,060
 myself when when i start to get future matt does not give a shit about this shit about this um so

177
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,580
 that's the trick uh but it is it is yeah i think i think everyone gets fucking pissed about going

178
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:35,640
 on planes um no it's not it's not a fun experience for anyone so uh speaking of good deeds guys well

 to turn it on and um tear and it's tear duct

258

 and then it tells you like you can take out your sim card thing have you ever taken out

259
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,180
 the sim card of your own phone it's a pain it's scary you gotta get like a little paper clippy

260
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,360
 thing and you gotta like push real hard like harder than you would on like a delicate object

261
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,460
 and then like it goes and then it comes out and i laughed because i was following the directions

262
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,640
 on the youtube thing but of course you're playing pausing playing pausing and it says do not blow

263
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,120
 into the empty slot like a nintendo and i was like oh that's exactly what i did i had too late

264
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,060
 you need to put that before you need to tell me i did that immediately that's a go have you guys

265
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:11,340
 seen all the videos where people pour molten uh glue into their phone holes and pull it out

266
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:19,160
 as a cleaning method yeah oh no i've seen those i don't know that that's advisable i don't think so

267
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,740
 i i haven't done it um i don't i've seen the videos i haven't been tried to replicate i don't

268
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,040
 think you'll go i don't think you'll go to the apple store and they'd be like have you done

269
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,120
 molten glue at home i don't think that's ever gonna be i think it would fuck you up i think

270
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:41,360
 you could maybe do slime maybe no i'm do not i'm not putting any goo in my phone yeah they use the

271
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,860
 hot glue

272
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,600
 yeah i don't know yeah like if i get a little fuzz in the in the charging port of my phone i get a

273
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,820
 little q-tip and just pop the pop the fuzz out you get wait you pop out fuzz with a q-tip with more

274
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:58,960
 fuzz that seems ridiculous fight fuzz with fuzz fight fuzz with fuzz well you know now that i'm

275
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,060
 saying no now that you're saying it as an old-time video game collector you know we when i'd buy all

276
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:11,520
 those used copies they got and and movies too they got stickers all over them of course the best way

277
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,700
 that sticker residue off is with another adhesive sticker there you go so there you go fight fuzz

278
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,620
 with fuzz fight fuzz with fuzz uh mike nielsen matt have you gotten the $20 account the the

279
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:29,680
 account credit uh i haven't gotten that i probably show up on your next bill uh you're you're owed

280
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,320
 well i think you have to get it i think you have to call them and oh we say hey motherfucker you

281
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,580
 better get on according to the new york post there is a call for this to be done automatically now

282
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,420
 imagine it's like a $20 account credit which is being slammed for being inadequate do you feel

283
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,220
 like $20 is adequate or inadequate for your pain and suffering like i mean so a day without cell

284
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:01,640
 service is worth more than $20 oh yeah definitely more than 1 30th of your bill well i think i think

285
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,940
 it's a breach of their contract and i think it probably isn't given all the legalese that i'm

286
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,700
 sure it's not but at the same time i think that but i'll go to the prices store and tell them that

287
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,640
 but in certain cases it's a life or death situation i think i think they could really

288
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:25,280
 become uh here not heroes they could make some good positive news if they waive the monthly fee

289
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,380
 for everybody yeah i think i mean that if they said scooper nova girl matt wants to know how

290
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,700
 much the cupcakes were did were you even with the $20 credit are you still in hot to uh verizon here

294
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,660

297
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,600
 to just call them up and say hey give me $20 they go yeah there's the word there's the word what do

298
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,780

299
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,260
 be on the phone for an hour on hold with all the other schlubs trying to get a $20 fucking refund

300
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,680
 okay maybe you don't do it today but no way no way they're gonna let people stay on on hold for

301
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,740
 an hour for their $20 thing that's fucking great oh so you just click a link there you go i'm sure

302
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:48,720
 you can do it you should absolutely do it i just got $20 back from my uh oil change i'd spent but

303
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,120
 i spent 20 minutes doing it but that's worth it to me that's a dollar an hour for me you're really

304
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,200
 distracted by this $20 this is not where this story is going i'll tell you why because this

305
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,840
 is the $20 that's what this is to me you're speaking in terms of action figures that's a

306
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,720
 craving the hunter are you crazy you don't want to crave in the hunter are you insane

307
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,340
 are you insane not really i don't want to crave it though well you don't want to crave in the

308
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:27,640
 hunter you're not a spider-man fanatic he killed spider-man you know how hard that is to do

309
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:35,100
 this guy figured it out people have done it yeah i think he's the only one call the cops

310
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,500
 that's a crime that is murder he ended up dying over it

311
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,460
 oh he didn't actually kill spider-man that's the twist

312
00:29:45,460 --> 00:30:02,460
 look this is all adding up to is on the day there was a software update on the day there

313
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,320
 was some kind of weird cyber attack or not that took down a lot of verizon's network

314
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,220
 yes by total coincidence on the same day my sim card crapped out

315
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,700
 just a total do you think it couldn't have been coincidence it was some kind i think it was

316
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:24,480
 no or the update what do you think jacob what do you think i i tend to i i do tend to lean

317
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,240
 towards paul's way of thinking on these uh with the electronic stuff is is uh if if one thing

318
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,780
 happens i i don't i don't think it's usually coincidence i think it's usually somehow

319
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:40,260
 by something yeah maybe not in the way that maybe not in the way that we're thinking about but like

320
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,660
 i have an older phone i

321
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,400
 have a 12 right okay so i think what's the 17 is out now i think

322
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,200
 did someone give your phone a comic book with boobs in it because that's the ultimate corruption

323
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,640
 circles on circles circles in circles

324
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:05,120
 i i showed i showed my sim card the entertainment landscape in las vegas and it just gave up and

325
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,640

392
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,540
 ring less false than jacob smith

393

478
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,020
 And they came up, and they were just hysterical.

479
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,680
 You know, like, when audience members try to be funny,

480
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,520
 and they aren't, it sucks.

481
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,500
 If they're funny, it's not.

482
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,900
 Great.

483
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,500
 I laid out, and they just, she just took over.

484
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,460
 At one point.

485
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,060
 Smooth sailing.

486
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,740
 You know, I come up, I got the shackles stuck between my legs.

487
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,140
 And a guy in the back just goes, oh, balls.

488
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,700
 Like that, like that.

489
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,020
 And I was like, that's funny, right?

490
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,720
 Like, this is funny.

491
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,920
 And I go, and I let her go, I would tip my cap to you, sir.

492
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,480
 But obviously, you know, and I just show that my hands are stuck between my legs.

493
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,480
 And the girl just walks over and just doffs an invisible cap over my head.

494
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,200
 Just tips my cap for me.

495
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,320
 Hilarious.

496
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,060
 Well done.

497
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,340
 I was like, this is great.

498
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,760
 Is this a burlesque performer that you know?

499
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,320
 No.

500
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,920
 I just, I just, I met her that night.

501
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,040
 Oh, that's great.

502
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,200
 Shay was her name.

503
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,200
 Yeah, yeah, she was great.

504
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,420
 Who was it?

505
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:47,700
 Nice.

506
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,780
 Shay.

507
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,100
 Shay.

508
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:49,780
 Yeah.

509
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,060
 Okay.

510
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,020
 She's named after a stadium.

511
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,840
 Oh, you should give that as your name.

512
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,240
 I was going to say, I should have asked if that was her real name.

513
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,480
 She gave me a fucking valet name.

514
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,920
 She gave me a fucking fake valet name.

515
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,240
 Yes, I'm Shay Stadium of the Connecticut Stadiums.

516
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,340
 You know, we have all that stadium money.

517
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,700
 We have all that stadium money.

518
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,760
 How much stadium money do you have?

519
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,320
 But, yeah.

520
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,720
 Do we have two knitting scoops?

521
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,220
 We do.

522
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,000
 We have two knitting.

523
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,600
 This is good.

524
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,680
 I love it.

525
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,380
 It's a higher compliment than when we're told that people, people like to, people tell me

526
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,340
 like straight confidently.

527
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,120
 Like, I fall asleep to you all the time.

528
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,940
 And I don't know how to take that as a compliment.

529
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,220
 You should take it as a compliment.

530
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,720
 I said that, I said that to Joel Hodgson.

531
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,180
 He did not take it as a compliment on Twitter.

532
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,080
 But that's because he couldn't hear the nuance and love in my voice.

533
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,620
 That's right.

534
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,920
 I live by those movies.

535
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,180
 But knowing, I think knowing that people knit to us is maybe, that is the highest compliment, I think.

536
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,740
 It's a pretty high compliment.

537
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,660
 I can see multiple knitters.

538
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,580
 It is very relaxing.

539
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,200
 David Sorensen, what do you do with your hands, buddy?

540
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,680
 Get to knitting.

541
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,780
 Get to knitting.

542
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,220
 Go.

543
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,000
 Come on.

544
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,840
 Let's go.

545
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,340
 There he goes.

546
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,080
 He's doing it.

547
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,620
 He's doing it.

548
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,060
 Mattingly, what are you doing with your hands?

549
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,300
 Losing at Jock vs. Nerd.

550
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,720
 Boo!

551
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,100
 Boo!

552
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,700
 You want to do a little Jock vs. Nerd action?

553
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,700
 Oh, am I?

554
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,060
 Fuck.

555
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,480
 Fuck yeah.

556
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,240
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

557
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,780
 Excellent.

558
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,980
 Hunt, hunt, hunt for balls.

559
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,980
 Hunt, hunt, hunt for balls.

560
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,120
 Balls.

561
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,860
 On the hunt for balls.

562
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,200
 Oh!

563
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,300
 All right.

564
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,880
 Real quick.

565
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,840
 Two things.

566
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,600
 First of all.

567
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:39,860
 Okay.

568
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,820
 It's colder than a witch's tit out here in fucking Pittsburgh.

569
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,620
 It's so...

570
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,380
 Paul Mattingly's favorite saying, everybody drink.

571
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,560
 But you love your governor, so lucky you.

572
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,140
 We do have a pretty good governor.

573
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,880
 It's so cold out here.

574
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,860
 Uh, that's why I'm literally wearing a jacket because we have heater on in the house.

575
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,760
 It's just, it's cold.

576
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,800
 It's so, so cold.

577
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,140
 It's been bitterly cold for days and the, the cold is just seeping into the bones of the

578
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:04,780
 home at this point.

579
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,300
 Uh-huh.

580
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,020
 Uh, and then also.

581
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,700
 We have stopped, we have stopped the show.

582
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,600
 Paul is cold.

583
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,820
 I don't know if you saw, but the final reveal has been made.

584
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,560
 Uh, the Pokemon.

585
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,040
 On the Masked Singer?

586
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,760
 The Pokemon crossover with Lego.

587
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,040
 The first three sets have been revealed.

588
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,220
 Oh.

589
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,000
 Did you see?

590
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,640
 Pokemon Lego?

591
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,520
 Yes.

592
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,520
 There's new Pokemon Lego?

593
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,420
 I have not seen, no.

594
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,640
 So, Mega Bloks, which is the company owned by Mattel, which is one of their rivals, they

595
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,280
 had the license for a while and they were making Pokemon Legos.

596
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,220
 So now the Pokemon company is working in tandem with Lego.

597
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:47,060
 Can you, uh, put a guess out there as to what the biggest set of the, it's Charizard, uh,

598
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,520
 Venusaur, and Blastoise in a big diorama.

599
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,000
 What is your price tag you think might be on that?

600
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,720
 Uh, three piece, big display set.

601
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,980
 Oh, I thought you were going to have us guess what they were, but you named the characters

602
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,320
 because I was all ready to guess.

603
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,740
 Um, there's two other sets.

604
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,580
 I can have you guess.

605
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,100
 Okay.

606
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,860
 Well, I wouldn't have been able to name any of the characters anyway.

607
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,680
 Well, what do you think?

608
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,160
 I was going to guess either Riachu, Pinky Rat, Foxfire, or Hermie.

609
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,080
 Uh.

610
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,120
 I'm reading them off my phone.

611
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,760
 No.

612
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,440
 Um, okay.

613
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,720
 Pikachu, of course.

614
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,320
 Riachu is an evolution of Pikachu.

615
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,460
 You could make a Riachu out of that Pikachu.

616
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:20,780
 Yeah.

617
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,220
 Riachu is an evolution of Pikachu.

618
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,160
 Yeah.

619
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,700
 Yeah.

620
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,060
 Yeah.

621
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,200
 Okay.

622
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,500
 Price tag for all three of them is a Lego build.

623
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
 It's a, it's a, it's a one piece.

624
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:35,340
 It's the three big bads from the original game in a, in a large display base.

625
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,360
 Big.

626
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360
 It's big, big.

627
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,040
 And like, it's pretty big.

628
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,700
 So a lot of pieces.

629
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,040
 It's big.

630
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,800
 It's a big, it's a big set.

631
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,720
 What is your, what is your price tag guess for this big Pokemon Lego set?

632
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,220
 $20.

633
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,920
 I mean, it's going to be 20 bucks.

634
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,640
 All right.

635
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:50,960
 All right.

636
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,400
 Good guess.

637
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,740
 Good guess.

638
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,200
 I'm seeing $350.

639
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,860
 I'm seeing $495 in the scoop here.

640
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,720
 $1,000 is guessed by Andy.

641
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,740
 $4.95.

642
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,240
 I think it'd be more than that.

643
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,060
 Dave Sorensen is.

644
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,680
 Is it limited?

645
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,380
 Is it?

646
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,600
 Are they only making blank amounts?

647
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,140
 No, it's not limited.

648
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:05,680
 No.

649
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,180
 Okay.

650
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,200
 No.

651
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,060
 Oh, that is a great hat, Yarn and Sticks.

652
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,660
 That is a great hat you just made.

653
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,540
 That is a nice looking hat.

654
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:13,700
 That's really cool.

655
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,680
 That's really cool.

656
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,460
 I would pay.

657
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,080
 How much is it?

658
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,500
 I just, two birds for no reason.

659
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,920
 I would, I would, I would pay three.

660
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
 Oh, the whole house.

661
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,100
 The whole hat is middle fingers.

662
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,420
 Because it's all birds.

663
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,880
 It's a bunch of hat middle fingers.

664
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,020
 See, it fools you.

665
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,600
 Oh.

666
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,220
 That's a nice cozy hat to wear to a protest in Minnesota right now.

667
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,600
 Yeah.

668
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:34,940
 Yeah.

669
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,080
 That's exactly it.

670
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,840
 Okay.

671
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,100
 So, I'm going to guess that I would, I would do five Yarn and Sticks hats for that Pikachu.

672
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,540
 I mean, that's good.

673
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:44,880
 Oh, easily.

674
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,140
 Good trade.

675
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,600
 Good trade.

676
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,060
 I don't know what the little sets are going for.

677
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:53,280
 Now, the big set is actually priced to move at $650.

678
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,900
 God damn it.

679
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,620
 I know.

680
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,580
 And this is the thing, right?

681
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:04,960
 Like, Pokemon is very much a kid-oriented brand, or it was for a time.

682
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,980
 And Lego also, kid-oriented brand for a time.

683
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,960
 But this is a, this is a specific product based at adult collectors.

684
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,040
 Yeah.

685
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:20,200
 And so, you could, they even asked in like an AMA, and people were like, is this a Lego

686
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:20,940
 set for kids?

687
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,940
 And they're like, nope.

688
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,260
 This is for adults.

689
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:23,500
 Okay.

690
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:23,760
 Okay.

691
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,540
 So, they, you know, they acknowledged it at least.

692
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,040
 Adult collectors.

693
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,360
 Yeah.

694
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,320
 No, no yucking anyone's yum.

695
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,520
 No, you know, kink shaming, no whatever.

696
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:36,820
 But like, if you bring a possible lover back to your house, and they're going to touch

697
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,040
 the thing, you go, no, no, no, no, no, no.

698
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,740
 That was $650.

699
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,940
 Like, I feel like, I feel like the date is over.

700
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,000
 No, I think the date might be over if that's the reaction.

701
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,680
 If you don't care that they touch your $650 Charizard, I think that makes you cool.

702
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:02,400
 who oh that was like because i have a lego i have a lego batmobile on my bar at the at the house

703

721
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:52,060
 situation and what's their reaction but you have to also know that lego

722
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:58,920
 as an investment have appreciated at a rate greater than even gold and that is true

723
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:06,880
 the evaluation of lego is greater even than gold in the last what else is the last like 15

01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:10,140
 technical problem uh oh yeah none of his guests on that one oh our matt closing out the category

909
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:14,020
 end the game that paul is definitely winning and matt is gonna probably get second place it's a

910
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:18,460
 daily double we'll have to get this so i get third place so there's stakes here oh that's true yeah

911
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:25,140
 we got stakes this song began 2025 at number one on the billboard hot 100 and fun fact it is the

912
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:31,420
 number one song on the day i am writing this scoopity 12 10 25 that's not a helpful hint at

913
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:40,940
 all well it means it was number one for either a long time or twice billboard hot 100 oh i know it

914
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:48,500
 is this a sabrina carpenter song i don't think so i think this is a song that comes around

915
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:55,020
 in december oh oh oh uh uh uh amy winehouse is no uh

916
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:04,000
 amy winehouse is they try to make me go to rehab and i say merry christmas

917
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:17,080
 i could go to rehab i gotta wrap presents and no no no um pariah carries all i want for christmas

918
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:24,900
 all i want for christmas is you matt that's right and that is the game

919
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:30,880
 ball wins with 2 000 points matt's insane with 800 i'm in third with 200 that's from rum raisenberg

920
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:38,640
 and that was 2025 in retrospective that's a great scoopity good job nicely done rum raisenberg

921
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:45,180
 uh how much we don't remember but uh you know like you know maybe i'm i'm a little embarrassed

922
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:50,700
 that i've never heard of the best picture winner that's yeah i hadn't heard of it either

923
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:54,780
 although i'm not as embarrassed as they should be well 2020 was famous

924
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:59,840
 this is why i listen to my showbiz podcast is that like it was famously hampered by the

925
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,100
 this is still the echoes of the writer's strike uh or the actor's right so they couldn't get

926
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,700
 enough stuff into production so movie theaters were pissed about how little product was coming

927
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:15,440
 to the pipeline in 2025 it was a bad year for tv too um it's just like everything was so delayed

928
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,960
 from all the strikes great year for keeler though that pluribus is just taking off he's doing great

929
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,660
 hey i see paul chambered up there i don't think he's paul a full proper shout out

930
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:29,420
 but i had a i had a uh a corporate gig in south bend and he basically lives he lives in south

931
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:34,840
 bend not basically he lives in south bend um but he basically stepped up as my advanced man

932
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:40,360
 he he oh wow he helped get stuff to to the venue that need to be he was there at the venue before

933
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,660
 i got there he introduced himself to the person running the venue and like he had me all set i

934
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,940
 like walked in and everything was like set up for me because paul did everything and it was really

935
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:54,160
 great it was it was awesome and just oh awesome further proof that just our podcast audiences are

936
