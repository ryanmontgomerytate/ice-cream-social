1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Why does the black flat cap feel more pretentious than the other caps it looks good

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,560
 I would say it is no more or less pretentious than your other cap. Thank you. Definitely looks very peaky blinders

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,340
 Yeah, that's what I mean. You look like you look like you're you're you're a bit of a patty enforcer

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,480
 You are a patty enforcer, man. Hello. This is my favorite part of this show my drag name

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,960
 This is the part of this show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,800
 Thank you ice cream truck drivers. I don't have a new list for the month yet

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,960
 We want to thank each and every ice cream truck driver

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,680
 And we will we will thank each and every one of you by name before this month is over

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,120
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, maybe you just want to be a patty driver

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,320
 I don't know head on over to preaching fun comm preaching fun comm is we're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,800
 And who knows?

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,560
 Life you save maybe your own

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,420
 It's time for a program. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,080
 A bunch of where the fuck were you? It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social sitting in prison. That's Matt

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,840
 Pittsburgh that's called Maddie Lee. I'm Jacob in Vegas

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,940
 We're preaching fun fun. So I I know exactly what you're talking about that big

17
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,520
 Nabi thing I have one too

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,640
 Yes, so it's the

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,360
 Shore the shore little

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,760
 microphone connector

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,880
 Adapted to an XLR connection is what you're referring to and it gives power right? It gives power to the microphone

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,960
 Yeah, the the your your recorder is sending phantom power to it as well, which is I think

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:10,320
 Forty something volts. I don't remember what it is. So I you know pack my heaviest stuff and put it on my carry-on

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,720
 To get weight out of my case for when I travel with my magic stuff

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,360
 Ah, so one of the items is shackles. They're actual iron shackles

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,560
 And then my jar of rings

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,320
 My thing of rope and so I got it got pulled out at the Fort Lauderdale Airport

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,160
 and I

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,800
 You know

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 I'm thinking it's gonna be about the shackles which only one time someone was like you can't you can't travel with these and I was

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,580
 Like oh, I sure can and for some reason that worked and then they let me go

32
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,440
 Yeah, I was like no I travel with them all the time

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,800
 And and all of a sudden he goes. Oh, it's this right here and he pulls out the microphone

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,960
 I go what he goes this is this adapter and the x-ray looks like it looks like a high caliber of bullets

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:11,740
 That's it my high caliber bullets is this guy bit x-ray my singular shot my my one

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,880
 My one high caliber bullet. I'm taking with me to assassinate the pilot from the back of the plan with my sniper rifle

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,480
 back and to the left

38
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,400
 Matt the man with the golden

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,840
 Donnelly exactly

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,480
 Don't mind me carry just just carries one bullet. Just the jackal making my way through the Florida Airport

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,840
 I'm actually shooting my target is at the Miami Airport. I'm that good. I'm shooting high wind

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,160
 From one airport to another it's one of those check the wind first. Yeah. Yeah, it's a whole big thing

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,840
 It's like one giant bullet will be traveling into a private jet taking out from Miami Airport

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,880
 Don't be traveling via private jet

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:04,320
 Yes, and it's not shot out of a gun because I didn't pack that so it's I just I just wheel my shackles like a slingshot

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,120
 And they put the bullet in there and I sling it like David and then boom

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,800
 And then as long as you do it in the plane

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,420
 Then the bullet is traveling at the speed of the plane in addition to the speed that the earth is already rotating

49
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,660
 All the velocity I need just comes from the flight itself. I just have to drop the bullet out the window

50
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,340
 It's like throwing pennies off the Empire State Building

51
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,680
 That's why I always request the seat with the rolled out window that

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
 the

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
 proposition that you're creating the

54
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,520
 Strategic crazy scenario you're creating could actually be the plot of an episode of Gogo 13

55
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:54,260
 Gogo 13, he's an incredible assassin and it one of my favorite anime

56
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,140
 Anime and manga of all time and Gogo 13 does constantly those kinds of

57
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,440
 Impossible assassinations that he's just a gun for hire. He's like this cold

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,080
 Merciless killer you pay him enough money

59
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,520
 He will do whatever needs to be done and then the investigators are always this close to figuring out

60
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,580
 But then they're like no fucking way. Could anybody do this?

61
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,480
 Line a lot of other things should use that same plot line and then they go back then they go back and they go

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 Oh fuck. He did do that

63
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:34,500
 Then they show you how he fucking did it and it's like what holy shit. Yeah, go go 13 is

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,040
 Unstoppable

65
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,820
 Bossy says I'm actually just throwing it like a dart from the back of the plane to hit the pilot. Just yeah

66
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,700
 The physics physics checks out nobody check it but the physics checks

67
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,680
 All you do is hold it in your body run the numbers hold it in your hand

68
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,260
 While you're landing and then just let go and let let gravity do the work. That's right

69
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,200
 Like don't like my idea is when they jump up and down inside of an elevator. Uh-huh

70
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,120
 Yeah, same same thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah

71
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,960
 All right

72
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
 Are any of you?

73
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
 watching land man

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,480
 No, man, I love land man. Okay, we have we haven't started the new season yet, but we burned through the first season

75
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,880
 I hung back until those four episodes and now I'm four episodes caught up with a new season is this who is this?

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,280
 Who's the land is Billy Bob Thornton Thornton?

77
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
 Demi Moore is in it. Oh, he's fantastic

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,200
 Yeah, the whole cast is really killer. Okay, Myron chat. She's not willing to pay for paramount respect respect on that

79
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,160
 There's just there are websites you can go to have to sail the seas

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,100
 Now you just gotta start now go the full other direction Myron steal steal the show

81
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:59,680
 So

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,800
 Landman for those who don't watch the show. It's the most popular show on paramount plus and Billy Bob Thornton plays a grizzled

83
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,280
 foul-mouth

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,480
 Smoking land man where he is there meaning what?

85
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,340
 So land man are people who own oil fields small smaller oil operators, right?

86
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,740
 I weren't working for the big guns, but they're just trying to get by

87
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,040
 Which is definitely something that Matt and I knew before watching land man. Sure

88
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,560
 What is it? So Taylor Sheridan for whether you want to whether you want to go with cause or symptom?

89
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,280
 He is simply basically between Yellowstone and mayor of Kingstown, you know

90
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
 in

91
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 1923 and these shows like he basically

92
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,960
 takes pockets of where white dudes might feel obsolete and

93
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,840
 Gives them monologues and speeches that that kind of build up, you know, these these broken ways of life, right?

94
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,480
 And here's the thing. I

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,080
 Actually like at first like used to I feel conflicted about this right here because this is you know

96
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,120
 The way of the way this country is going right now

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,440
 It seems like that's that's a big force behind a big imaginary force behind a lot of a lot of actions being taken

98
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,080
 Yeah

99
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:26,040
 I'm doing a show on the on the cruise ship and I get this guy up on stage and he is

100
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,740
 Basically me like one point five me in size like exact body type just six foot five

101
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,520
 and just a little wider and thick arms or whatever and

102
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,360
 I

103
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,680
 say

104
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 You know, hi, you know, what do you do for a living?

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,560
 You know, do you work that kind of stuff and he goes I work in the oil and gas distribution from Texas

106
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,400
 Yes

107
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,120
 Yes, and I say because basis like my dad growing up hated law shows

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,000
 See hated the way the law was portrayed

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,960
 On television and it made people assume stupid questions all the time

110
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,740
 So I wonder if that's better or worse now or if it's just the same

111
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,320
 For like new legal dramas because I feel like the new legal dramas try to stay more true to the law

112
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,840
 They don't ones do but like they're still ridiculous legally

113
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,880
 Yeah, my dad was just laughs like how quickly they can like get like lab results and stuff like that

114
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,040
 Like he's just like big in lab results like the next day or the same Leon in the chat is saying they are not much better

115
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,160
 Jacob

116
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,760
 Okay. Yeah, right

117
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,960
 Leon is our barrister. He's yes our law he's there Leon. He's our law man

118
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,760
 We need a law man, so I say

119
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,980
 Do you love or hate the show land man

120
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,920
 Good and he like literally turns to me

121
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,840
 Like like doesn't doesn't like he's like we're not having a conversation. He just turns to me and he goes, oh

122
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,760
 That is the most accurate portrayal of the oil and gas

123
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,420
 I have ever seen on TV or movies and he almost has tears in his eyes

124
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:17,720
 You know now there is fascinating shit in the show there is shit that you do not you never thought about the oil and gas

125
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,120
 industry sure there is like really they really do do a good job of like

126
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,800
 Villages where the where the workers like live like the box house villages, you know things like that

127
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,760
 It's it's really fascinating. It's neat stuff. There's one was like there's an there's an oil

128
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,280
 Area left all alone and therefore there's like a toxicity thing that can happen

129
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,000
 And so they come across dead bodies and then also they go what's going on on the alarms go off on their uniforms and they go

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,880
 running

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,160
 So they don't die and you're like, oh right. I had no idea no idea that that kind of scenario

132
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,780
 There are electronic canaries in the coal mine now. Yeah. Yeah, they've got yeah

133
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,760
 It's a little like gas meters and by the way the same thing for I think nuclear stuff by the way, Matt

134
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,280
 I know this wasn't intentional, but you just basically told a Trump rally story

135
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,880
 Saying there was big guy big guy came up to me and I turned to him and I said

136
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,920
 Do you like land man or not? And with tears in his eyes big guy big guy tears in his eyes

137
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,440
 I love land man. He tells me let me people are saying people and with that I'll finish out

138
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,120
 He said no one's ever asked me about land man before only you know, I'm joking

139
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:42,040
 I didn't take the turn. All about no one ever knows it's all about me and how I'm unique

140
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,000
 He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said that is the best question anyone has ever asked me about land man

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,440
 Sensational question such a good question giant men who weep

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,520
 You asked the best questions Matt not only my noodler. So it's it is teaching you all kinds of

143
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:13,560
 Actual tricks of the trade within the land man community. It is like any good show and that is a voyeur

144
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,880
 It's a it's a voyeuristic, you know

145
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,760
 Thing where you're getting eating a pocket of the world. You wouldn't normally get a pocket out of right?

146
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,120
 It's still filled with its weird weird monologues, you know and things like that

147
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,880
 The season opens with Billy Bob doing a big monologue about breakfast and like the waitress is the most important meal of day and he

148
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,080
 Just lectures her about who profits from breakfast and blah blah blah blah and it's just Taylor shared

149
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,400
 It just has these monologues that are just atrocious

150
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,120
 and one-dimensional

151
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,800
 But you tolerate Billy Bob Thornton or Kevin Costner doing them, right? It's almost like a challenge, you know, I

152
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
 Can do this I got this

153
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,560
 Yeah, all I do watching land man all I do is talk like Billy Bob Thornton the entire time and it makes SJ really happy

154
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,800
 No, but I was trying I was trying to think about my man on the ship and I was trying to think about like

155
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,760
 Even he came up on like my family call like one of my brothers is really into it

156
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,240
 my brother's thinks it's a piece of shit show right and it was kind of like right, you know them fighting words and

157
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,660
 I mean I kind of I get both arguments

158
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,920
 Everyone's right

159
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,000
 but you know we talk on this like these these weird times and I and I and I was basically kind of like

160
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,640
 thinking about

161
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
 Basically, it's the word obsolete

162
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,120
 That okay, that is the word like I've been trying to find a way

163
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,520
 to put my

164
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,440
 To encapsulate I think attention that's driving all this shitty decisions

165
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,680
 Like I think like so many things that are shitty about this world are not you know themselves?

166
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,040
 I think caused by one thing. I think they were dominoes were pushed, right?

167
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,960
 Whether we're talking about like trumpism or you know iced tensions that kind of stuff like all these crazy shit that's happening

168
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,840
 Uh-huh, and I think like if I'm trying if it was

169
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:13,560
 As I go my walks, I was thinking about my friend on the other ship and then my brother's fighting and and I was like I

170
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,260
 think that like part of

171
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,520
 Like AI and technology and basically tech tech has taken all of the money, right and

172
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,880
 All of the talent and now has seized all of the power right like like tech runs

173
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,080
 Washington and Tex runs all of media now, right?

174
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,880
 And the billion and the billionaires are more richer than us than ever

175
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,760
 Right, and then I think like basically like we're all afraid of

176
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:50,480
 Our ways of life becoming obsolete from one facet or another because of this right? Okay. Yes. I see what you mean now

177
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,960
 yeah, and so like if I feel like shit is on my doorstep and

178
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,400
 You tell me to help other people because they're doing something

179
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,040
 experiencing something less fortunate and

180
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,880
 I feel like no one's talking about what's making my life unfortunate

181
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:13,640
 Right, like if I feel like I'm cool and not obsolete if I feel like I am thriving and you tell me to help somebody else

182
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,720
 Yeah, I go like cool. No problem

183
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,760
 But if you come to me and say, you know, no one's doing stuff about these poor people over here

184
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,240
 And you're like wait mom about to lose my whole fucking way of life

185
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,240
 Yeah, I just got back from the food bank and you're telling me that this is a problem over here

186
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,920
 And I don't process that tension properly, right? I don't process that like I think my way of life is going away

187
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,580
 Right, you know like even we do on our show we were do we're like, oh, we're just three white dudes talking

188
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,820
 Right and so like we reduce ourselves to be like wait the world should be more diverse. We're not diverse enough

189
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,520
 We're getting older. We're done with mainstream things. We're over here in our little pocket, right?

190
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,240
 like we do to ourselves a little bit, you know, I would say actually Paul's probably the biggest voice that fights against it and

191
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:05,480
 Like and then you tell us to help go help something else is there's a little bit like I'm trying to fucking hold it down here

192
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,440
 Right, but you don't want to admit that you don't want to admit that I'm trying to hold it down

193
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,000
 You don't want to admit that you're afraid of losing it all right

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,360
 You want to have pride and stuff like that. So I feel like this ups and then I think the the

195
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,960
 Lockdown and pandemic just poured accelerant all over this tension

196
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:30,280
 And I think like it's really hard to shake that feeling

197
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,560
 So like I'm thinking that like I think that's a way

198
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,040
 To fight against what we're doing in a positive way

199
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,440
 I think you have to identify if someone is feeling like they're being made to feel obsolete

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,320
 And you have to find ways in yourself and other people make them feel like they can thrive and I feel like if you do

201
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,160
 That that would be the first way to put a some force against what we're doing

202
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,200
 It's a very deep thought it was on my mind

203
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,960
 It is all because I was watching land man and we can we can talk about something else

204
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,560
 I have a very embarrassing story to follow up with this if this goes nowhere, but

205
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,280
 But well, I think you're seeing it now that

206
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,200
 the ultimate solution

207
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,780
 For people in a political place where what they're doing is terribly unpopular

208
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,160
 Their ultimate solution is I'm going to give people money

209
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,480
 But unfortunately that should always be the thing the government should be helping

210
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
 the citizenry

211
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,280
 To elevate their standard of living constantly. Yeah, we came up we came out of the pandemic with the wrong lessons learned

212
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,200
 when they did help bolster us and give us what was tantamount to a

213
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,780
 Basic, you know median basic income, right? You know subsidy

214
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,000
 Yes, which we've got and and you spoke by the way. Here's your money back, right?

215
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,600
 But we spoke to pride if that's exactly right Jacob and we spoke we spoke to pride right or you talked about that

216
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
 Yeah, we need to look at that in a whole nother way

217
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,160
 We have conditioned a generation to look at any benefit coming from the government as something unnecessary

218
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,400
 shameful and to be repelled

219
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,000
 Right, which is crazy

220
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,440
 Because what are you paying them for then if not not work for you? We're all working together

221
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,080
 They are our society to our our representatives. They are our representatives

222
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,960
 They are to represent our interests and if our interests currently require that we get some kind of financial

223
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,400
 Benefits and incentives to move forward in proper way. Not just certain groups is that's what's happening already

224
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,320
 Farmers are getting a lot of incentives real soon

225
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,340
 Yeah again yet again, and it's still not gonna be enough

226
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,740
 But we don't even have to we don't even have to bag on the farmers

227
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,360
 No, I can just talk about the things we're already talking about. Let's just talk about the people in the oil industry

228
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,680
 Oh, we're just being handed money fucking forget about it. Yeah, exactly

229
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,520
 People who are being handed money for no reason, but when but when little

230
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,040
 People look at the same kind of thing we have we have been

231
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,800
 Socially engineered to be like, oh no, I don't need anything. I don't need help. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a handout

232
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 It's a handout on the small scale on the large scale. It's capitalism, right?

233
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:25,600
 Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, it's it's it is strange and complicated are it's bizarre

234
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,240
 And and yet these giant men coming to you with tears in their eyes

235
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,320
 No, I'll tell you who else has giant men coming on them with tears in their eyes all the time wait

236
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
 I didn't get that part of the story yet

237
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:52,560
 That's the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by the fine people providers purveyors and makers of

238
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:59,000
 Greek yogurt, that's right. It's just a commercial for Greek yogurt for 2022. That's from the scoop Henley

239
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,500
 We're talking about Greek yogurt

240
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,160

241
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,680
 that that it that it that it that it that it that it

242
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,560
 Hey

243
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,800

 You needed some yogurt. I got you. I got you. What do you need?

246
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:32,560
 This here yogurt got a little bit of the tomato and a basil, huh? Yeah fresh from the Greek island

247
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:41,320
 That that that that that that that that that that that hey, why don't you put a little is a Greek yogurt all over your piece?

248
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320

249
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,400
 Over your piece of pie. How about you put a little bit in it inside of the pasta sauce, huh?

250
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,280
 And just a little bit of zest now. That's a Greek

251
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,000
 Hey when you're here you the family

252
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,920

253
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,800
 Hey

254
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,840
 Pasta fazul a Greek yogurt. Mmm. Yummy. Yummy

255
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,400
 Mangia

256
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:29,480
 Yeah, no, I don't think me it like like basically while I was wrapped up in that beautiful commercial

257
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:39,120
 Sure oil tree sure the farms sure all of college sure all of medicine sure all like like we have been quietly

258
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,460
 Always training wheels and pushing every industry, right? And so, you know

259
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,820
 We have never the successful industries, right?

260
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,040
 And so like we have never

261
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,120
 Been a purely capitalistic thing but as soon as we want to point at something and say stop doing that we say like see

262
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,580
 It's not capitalism. It's socialism but raw

263
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,720
 but the truth is we've buttressed our entire country almost every aspect of our lives with government effort and

264
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,500
 It's been successful. Like it's what's made America

265
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,160
 And so it's like we improv Matt improv

266
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,360
 Improv in all of its forms

267
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,920
 Vallis Bolan was paid by the federal government

268
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,960
 This is again an initiation of theater games for children during the Great Depression

269
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,860
 Yeah

270
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:44,440
 Improvisation is germinated from that government investment an entire my life

271
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,560
 My life from this woman's brilliance and the government funding that made it possible for her to do

272
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:00,840
 That's it. I agree the only way for improv comedy to be successful is to have government backing

273
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,760
 It's the fucking fact. I would love to have a little look government jingle in my pocket every time I was teaching

274
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,240
 Holy shit make things real smooth, but just in general that needs to be

275
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,000
 yeah, we and I mean art is the first thing that gets it in the dick and

276
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,820
 Yeah, you know and that's things like so like I mean, we're very much out of our depths in terms of talking specifically about

277
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:33,400
 Hello

278
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,320
 But I think part of like we're trying to get people to chill is to be like is a little bit of a wake-up like hey

279
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,000
 We've been kind of doing this with everything the whole time and it's not just just the lefties

280
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,800
 It's not just the righties and it's not just what I'm so mad. What you're saying is the solution to this might be

281
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,400
 Education. Oh good

282
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,920
 good

283
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,440
 Then that's assured that we're gonna move forward in a positive direction then because that's gonna be a priority going forward

284
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,240
 Linda fucking McMahon

285
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,560
 Is running of all things I can't even watch WWE anymore

286
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,920
 Not even no, not even like recap shit. Nothing. I haven't watched it for like a year. It's terrible

287
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,980
 It's just like this is your it's the oh, it's because real like a professional wrestling

288
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,760
 I know it's done so much damage to the earth. I

289
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,600
 Listen to the whole fucking planet. They're gonna have a fucking UFC fight

290
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:39,960
 By the same company

291
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
 Gonna go

292
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
 Yeah, you're right

293
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,640
 I'm definitely gonna go ice cream socials going to the UFC fight on the front

294
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:57,440
 Press pass, of course, although. Oh, did you turn out ever did you see the explosive new?

295
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:05,240
 Confession I don't know what you'd have you how you actually say it. Are you familiar with the

296
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,120
 Canadian screw job

297
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,880
 Yes, the Montreal Montreal screw job, right? Oh this this is the the the Bret Hart thing Michael's

298
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,800
 What happened so Bret Hart was wrestling in his hometown

299
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,080
 he was gonna retire from the WWE or leave the WWE go somewhere else or whatever and

300
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,520
 They said you have to turn over your heavyweight belt to the new upcoming star Sean Michaels

301
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,640
 And he said not in Montreal not in my home city. Like we have to we'll have to do it another at another match

302
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,440
 Okay, and it's like this is where I'm from and this is where I can he's a lot of pride in me being the heavyweight champion

303
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,600
 you know, we'll do a fight there, but it's got to be a different time and

304
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,080
 Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels colluded behind Bret Hart's back and the Bret Hart

305
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,380
 Is fighting out of some chokehold or something like that and gets basically called out and loses the match and the look on his face

306
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,000
 When the bell goes off and thing is over this and they're gonna give Shawn Michaels the belt the look on his face is

307
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,240
 Crazy and it is a famously

308
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,520
 When the most moment in WWE where they broke quote-unquote k-fabe, right?

309
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,840
 When it's a very shoot moment. Yeah, meaning it was happening for real

310
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,840
 It was happening for real and I think Brett wouldn't like punched Victor convinced McMahon

311
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,960
 I think like or something like that. At least spit on him. I think according to this he spit on him

312
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,920
 Yeah, spit on him and maybe punched him too. Yeah. Yeah

313
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,900
 so but it made so much news that they had to break k-fabe to break the the the

314
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,800
 fakeness of wrestling because it was it was leaking out that this was a crazy thing that happened behind the scene. Uh-huh. Well

315
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,240
 Bret Hart has just this past week come out and said

316
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,960
 You know Vince McMahon would always come on these specials whenever they were talking about the Montreal screw job and Vince's famous quote was

317
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
 We didn't screw Brett Brett screwed Brett

318
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,240
 Right. That was his favorite. Okay

319
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
 well

320
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
 according to Brett Hart

321
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,040
 It may be more accurate to say

322
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,400
 Vince screwed Shawn Michaels

323
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,200
 Wait, there is a rumor now

324
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,440
 Hart has put forth that

325
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:36,260
 Michaels and Vince McMahon mate where hat were flatmates at that point and that is a big reason why

326
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:42,160
 Vince put the belt on him and went through all that rigmarole because that was his current love boy

327
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,360
 I find it hard to believe that you can sleep your way to the top and WWE under Vince McMahon

328
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,640
 I know right unless you're willing to take a shit directly to the face

329
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:57,260
 It's not really uh, you're not your career's not really going to of course. This is what happened. This is obviously what happened

330
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,720
 This big man is a depraved animal. So the Montreal mudslide proceeded the Montreal

331
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:11,680
 Exactly exactly and that's how Brett that's how Shawn lost his smile because he got shit

332
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,800
 Yeah

333
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,240
 Pretty ridiculous pretty finally something that we know about the Leon saying it's the Montreal steamer. That's right

334
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,640
 That's a good one Leon. Yeah, so that's I didn't I didn't look into it too far

335
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,920
 I just heard enough from what I heard and I was like, okay, but

336
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,080
 Brett's usually a pretty straight shooter

337
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,160
 Or he knows this is the most scathing thing you can say about Vince McMahon

338
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:46,800
 I may maybe but why now? I guess cuz I don't know I think is he just was that your limitation

339
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,120
 He wants to kick him in the nuts. Yeah, maybe he just wants to yeah

340
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:57,320
 He would have come out I did follow this a little bit and I think it would have come out sooner had this actually been

341
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,120
 the case

342
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
 Really? Don't you think they didn't?

343
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,720
 Know media if you know anything about the ring boy scandals and all the other bullshit

344
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,240
 That's been going on and all this stuff that's followed the McMahons around for decades

345
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,520
 It's only really been having a light shown on it very recently that's had any kind of

346
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:27,040
 Consequence or public discussion about it. All right, that's reached. I hear you. I hear that. I hear that that makes sense

347
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,400
 Yeah, so I feel like yeah, I feel like there's a great deal more scrutiny

348
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,160
 I just think we're more attuned to it now and it's one of those things where back in the day

349
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,240
 You get stuff like that. Wow, he's a he's a very successful man. Of course, he's got haters, you know

350
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,260
 Of course, there's people after him and gonna start rumors and stuff

351
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,920
 But now with all the things that we do know about him and his and his crew

352
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,360
 And I don't I don't want to stick my neck out

353
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,400
 I don't want to you know stepping at the way these guys are they can be very litigious, but I don't think he's really that

354
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,120
 Damn, I think that's I think that's fake

355
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
 I think basic man as a fake

356
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,960
 Don't sue me up

357
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,340
 Okay, okay. That was that's Matt at hey scoops.com. That's who said that

358
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:19,200
 Tan is real. I think he's just I think he's just in a tanning bed. I don't think he uses like oh, yeah

359
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
 He's gone out of the beach

360
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,880
 No, so let's fight about that. No, so I speak of the wrestling

361
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,600
 I've grown to love John Cena as peacemaker and John Cena as a comedic actor

362
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,500
 Sure, and I never watched any wrestling with John Cena. Okay

363
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,960
 So five five move Charlie

364
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,780
 So he sat down to do an interview with Bill Simmons

365
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,160
 My favorite sports podcaster and talked to him for like over an hour. I was like, alright, let's do it

366
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,880
 And then it was all about his wrestling career and man

367
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,560
 You couldn't pay me to ever listen to John Cena talk about his wrestling career ever again

368
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:05,080
 The problem with that so I bought the I bought the problem with that ball one of the problem

369
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,840
 I bought the WWE game from I'm gonna say three years ago two years ago three. Okay three years ago and

370
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,960
 Let's say three. Let's say three. Whatever

371
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,920
 the

372
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:23,120
 Conceit of this one was Cena right, but not only Cena it was

373
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,440
 Cena recapping his biggest losses

374
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,240
 So that's the story mode that you play through you play through you play through as John Cena

375
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,760
 Through his biggest losses

376
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,480
 Yeah, and the thing and he he entered he is interviewed between each match

377
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,800
 Talking about what he learned and what the atmosphere was like during this match and special things about the opponent

378
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,000
 I kind of thing and it just comes off so crazy

379
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,720
 Because like it's very

380
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,320
 This isn't real right right it's not real things he's saying aren't really reason

381
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,600
 Oh boy, I knew coming into that ring. It was gonna be a real slobberknocker going

382
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,260
 I knew my competition with Andre the giant was gonna be exactly. It's like well, I don't think you ever fought Andre

383
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,800
 But like an example because I listened to this fucking interview yeah like he had to lose very badly

384
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:23,280
 To Brock Lesnar so that okay put up against Brock Lesnar would be then considered

385
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,480
 so

386
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,280
 Amazingly great that they had to be a champion so in order to put I think it was Roman Reigns

387
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,080
 The belts he had to get beat beat up by Brock Lesnar very badly that'd be okay

388
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,980
 They talked about like trying to like you know way that now hard that was physically and everything else and you know

389
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
 It's not it shouldn't be

390
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,100
 Correctly no one gets hurt. I mean yes, it's painful. It's stressful. It's very athletic

391
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,600
 But you shouldn't be injuring people. It's dangerous shit. It's dangerous

392
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,640
 Okay, hold on because I want to come back to this we do have to go to a sponsor real quick

393
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
 but I want to come back to this so we're putting a pin in this and

 Find what you need

422
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:18,860
 No, no not yet. You haven't you never left. I have other options. We have all tubes

423
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,920
 How about something few people think of we have two worms?

424
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,760
 two

425
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
 worms here at

426
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,480
 tuberculosis

427
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,200
 Worms, whatever you want place them inside of you the children of the night

428
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,240
 What beautiful music to make oh?

429
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,680
 Ever heard the worms make music they ever heard them sing in the moonlight

430
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:56,900
 No, well you could get some and do it and the best way to hear them is by listening through a tube

431
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,120
 It will amplify the worm song

432
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,560
 You know I thought you were nuts when I came in here, but you're winning me over, but I don't have any nuts just to

433
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,160
 Enter a check out

434
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,240
 That's a good sponsor seems like a good company. Oh, they are great. I don't know how they make any money I

435
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,440
 Think from this just let people buy the tubes they want but the guy doesn't have any fasteners

436
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:33,960
 Tubes ain't worth shit loose tube loose tube loose tube don't do fuck for you

437
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:41,200
 So I'm thinking about pro wrestling now. Oh, oh danger zone is there

438
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,960
 Is it just impossible for people to pretend that someone is better?

439
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,640
 Than us or has won a championship or something like that

440
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,280
 Is it just impossible for us to just pretend that that's happening do we do we just fall into?

441
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,800
 The trap of this is real every time

442
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:06,960
 Is that why it matters to the WWF people or WWE people who wears the the fake championship belt?

443
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,320
 It's so strange because like I guess

444
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,280
 Cena on this last trip around

445
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,080
 Came close to if not

446
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,560
 eclipsed Rick Flair's

447
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,840
 title runs I

448
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,960
 Has I have seen that yeah, because it's seen it seen as like I don't remember it

449
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,840
 Couple more time 18 or 19 time world champion something like that. Yeah. Yeah anyway, it's but it just like one or two

450
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,360
 above Rick Flair

451
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,680
 but you know

452
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:45,600
 What does it mean but having having the belt doesn't it doesn't actually mean you haven't actually won

453
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:54,320
 You can't win it 17 times if you don't lose it 16. So I think the fuck is that I think

454
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,760
 Good point. That's just good. That's also true. That's math. That's that's just the math checks out on what Paul just said

455
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,040
 But I mean like really like you guys there's 16 guys who are clearly better than you

456
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,140
 They are still beholden to the crowd

457
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:17,520
 The crowd the live crowds and they're in and their audiences for sure. Yes, if they make the wrong person champion

458
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
 They hear about it, right? Oh, yes

459
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,300
 You know it matters it matters for their business that certainly matters. Yeah

460
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,080
 So there's like I'm thinking of is more of like the mental

461
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,440
 Is it is it possible for human beings to pretend that someone is the champion?

462
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,280
 Without kind of falling into that trap

463
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:44,580
 Well, I think we should have every mouth finger butthole champion on this podcast come back on and talk about their lives after

464
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:51,840
 Winning mouth good boy. Good boy. I don't know eyes have changed you watch enough of that wrestling and it just gets

465
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
 It gets crazy

466
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,680
 I'll never know I will never I will not put myself to that test

467
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,280
 My kids I would have if my kids got into wrestling I would have my kids did not get into wrestling

468
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,720
 Yeah, and I think thank goodness and I still love the old classic goofy shit

469
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,560
 I think it's funny as hell, but I appreciate it just for the the goofiness of it all

470
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,480
 But then you start if you start to really scratch at it. It just gets sad real fast

471
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,480
 You know, well, you know most things, you know, they're they're playing a spots on me

472
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,320
 If you scratch at them long enough, it gets real sad. I

473
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,240
 Often just stare at Jacob until I feel sad

474
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,040
 That's basically what I do to get it going just stare at Jacob while he's scratching when I want to drum up your sadness

475
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,560
 Do that?

476
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:47,560
 Paul yes, what are you asking for your wife for yourself for Christmas? Oh

477
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,200
 nothing

478
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,400
 Do you guys get each other stuff? Yeah, I got I got and a

479
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,760
 New coffee maker and a giant and of Green Gables box set. Oh, by the way

480
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,480
 Yeah, I want to step on this for a second the amount of like

481
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,240
 Ho-ho-ho someone works for Starbucks didn't have a good coffee maker at home

482
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,840
 Stop pretending like every fucking employee of Starbucks becomes like some coffee goddess where they have to be like

483
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,080
 Instruments or whatever like it was possible to be a regular human being with an aged coffee maker

484
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,000
 This is the problem get a job at Starbucks. It was only it was only like three years old

485
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,040
 It was a good coffee maker. It just happened to get a stink bug in it and that made her physically unable

486
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,540
 Look at the coffee maker anymore

487
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:41,360
 She legit just vomited everywhere. She couldn't look at the machine anymore without getting physically sick

488
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,880
 That's the there was nothing wrong with this coffee maker. It was fancy Dan

489
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,160
 You know you press the shit and the new one. I got her fucking fancy Dan

490
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,480
 It's got a milk steamer thing on it and all kind of hoodly-hoo. It's fancy. It's a nice coffee maker

491
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,560
 It was like, you know almost $200 coffee maker that I got on super sale at my old Target

492
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,480
 So that is now paying for itself there a little bit milk that milk spritzer doubles as a Swedish hot bidet

493
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,960
 If you use it properly an upside-down Swedish hot. Oh, you just gave me a nightmare. Oh

494
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,560
 God damn talk about oh for fuck's sake to the Swedish hot bidet

495
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:27,720
 I can think a few things more horrific then

496
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,440
 Superheated items up the asshole and I know that was a medieval staple slow nowadays

497
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,440
 Oh, come on take talk it slower. No, no, no

498
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,180
 How hot is hot what I just what would you do like the the original the original pain?

499
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,700
 of a blistering asshole and then

500
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,720
 What happens after that's even worse, oh my god, oh

501
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,640
 What happens after you shoot stevie milk into your asshole then the trouble start that's what I but it really does it

502
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,720
 It's Pandora's box

503
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
 It's Pandora's butthole

504
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,400
 You have opened Pandora's butthole and she will never shit right again

505
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:17,580
 My wife and I decided last night to not get anything for each other for our anniversary. Our anniversary is December 27th, right?

514
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,320
 Your guys's love language if I can be corny, I think so, right?

515
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,520
 I think so like I don't think you guys care about getting each other jewelry

516
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,040
 We get we are people that especially me. I mean, I'm worse about it than SJ is if there's something I want

517
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
 I usually just get it same

518
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,680
 Like in November SJ's like quit buying yourself stuff. Other people need to be able to buy you things for Christmas

519
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,700
 I just my luggage. Oh man, so I was

520
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,560

521
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,320
 So I get I get off of the ship at Fort Lauderdale and there's a place about about five blocks away

522
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:45,840
 You got to go down down to the light make a left about five blocks is Joe's Cafe old-fashioned diner

00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,940
 And after you've had like deluxe

524
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,840

00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
 For me two meals a day

526
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,040
 You just go like oh a diner with regular fucking eggs and regular fucking bacon

527
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,440
 Let's go and I often just you know, skip the uber line skip it. It's it's chaos in the port, right?

528
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
 So you just I just drag my bags

529
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,520
 This this trip I specifically was only doing 20-minute sets

530
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,800
 So I tried to only have one case and so I'm dragging my stuff and I'm going like man

531
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,260
 My case is heavy. I could put too much stuff in this case and I get all the way

532
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,720
 To Joe's and I don't realize I'm like covered in sweat

533
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:31,920
 And then I look and at some point at some point I busted a wheel off of my giant case and I didn't realize

534
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,000
 I was and I didn't realize I was fucking lugging you were just dragging

535
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,320
 Dragging a case for blocks. Did it recognize I was sweating? Yeah. No, it's it's toast, right? Oh, yeah

536
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,540
 So I should ask for luggage for Christmas when said I went on Amazon immediately ordered myself a luggage thing that I wanted

537
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,620
 And

538
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:59,380
 But I was laughing at like I thought I packed too much stuff and instead I lugged something like an ogre

539
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,560
 like half a mile

540
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,200
 And I was like so gross. I didn't realize how gross I was I go like go to get a table and I'm like just like

 You're not a jewelry person, right? She doesn't get you a fancy watch or something like that

555

 Like a ring or a bracelet or something like that every now and then but not not usually no

557
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,240
 Yeah, well, she's got to worry about how much weight you're putting on that hand the back of the hand, right? That's right

558
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:41,240
 Another cotton ring

567
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,040

582
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:02,000
 Rich scoop some people would say it's cruel to send gifts to Matt and Paul through me

583
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,360
 But uh, but yeah, that's it seems fine

584
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,800
 Paul bought me the Batman absolute Batman

585
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:17,360
 Thing first right you did get through it. It's great, right? Yes. What is that? That's that's the comic book?

586
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:23,240
 What yeah, yeah Scott Snyder wrote Batman for a while the the main title for a while and I loved it

587
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,640
 He did the whole court of owls and then on some really wild stuff

588
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,280
 really loved that so I

589
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,400
 Checked out his new stuff and this absolute Batman is just knocking it out of the park right now

590
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,120
 So yeah, I got Matt the first I guess it's the first five books. Yeah in the series

591
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,800
 What'd you like about it? I like spoilers possibly I guess yeah

592
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,100
 Yeah, but it's right off the top is Alfred's not his he's not rich and Alfred's not his butler, right?

593
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:57,600
 And so Alfred is just this other guy who's like a trained worldwide assassin and he's like he's actually like meant to like track down

594
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,240
 Track down a group days of tracking down. He runs into Batman and they realized they have to work with each other

595
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
 And it's really different deal

596
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:11,000
 And yeah, it's just it's just a it's Batman is younger guy

597
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,800
 And he's more this really frustrated almost like UFC fighter type person. It's really it's really clever. It's very cool. Yeah, yeah, I

598
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:24,120
 Quite like it and yes Cooper Nova girl the new absolute Batman drops today

599
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,560
 I haven't made it out to the comic shop yet today

600
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,080
 I might but I'm not buying it week to week

601
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,920
 But this current week's issue the cover is the Joker the reveal of the absolute Joker

602
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:41,240
 Looks insane looks like some kind of fucking creature. I don't know how they're gonna explain it, but it looks pretty wild

603
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,120
 I guess again. I'm behind

604
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,560
 By like five or six issues. I guess closer to ten by the time the trade comes out

605
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,280
 But I guess he went through his whole killer croc thing and a lot of his friends are now becoming

606
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,800
 The villains that they were destined to become. Yeah. Yeah, that's happening

607
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:08,080
 Yeah, so it's interesting. Yeah all all his childhood friends end up being the rogues gallery that Batman ends up fighting

608
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,560
 Yeah

609
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:18,000
 All right, is the it's just it's just take away take away his wealth being a superpower is probably one of the smartest things and

610
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Coolest things you could have done. Oh

611
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,120
 Yeah, that is interesting. Yeah

612
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,520
 He's a little more

613
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,440
 Gotcha. I mean he he was always making up for it with with more more tech genius stuff

614
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,920
 He well, he was always the Tony Stark of the DCU or vice versa

615
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,720
 I don't know how you really look Batman and Iron Man are more

616
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,480
 akin to each other than you might think and it's always myself but in this like

617
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,120
 Michaels right that's exactly right. He's a

618
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,480
 He's a construction worker. That's what makes him such a buff freak. That's a big part of it

619
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,880
 like he's he's going to school for for you know, Kim and all kinds of

620
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:05,560
 Super science stuff, but he's a construction worker. So like the Batmobile is a giant dump truck outfitted with armor and shit

621
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,600
 Yeah

622
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:17,680
 Let's do a little we're gonna save that email we're gonna do a little jock versus nerd oh shit

623
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,320
 Yeah, I'm on the hunt for balls

624
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:35,520
 The hunt for balls

625
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,040
 I'm Batman a real real quick Batman one last thing lemur creamer was asking do they keep his parents?

626
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,160
 So in this retelling he loses his father early on that's definitive, but his mom is still with him

627
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,080
 So that's a whole nother dynamic to that. His mother is still

628
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,520
 To very much alive and very much part of his life

629
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,760
 So that's interesting it is for the city and then they're after like politicians and stuff. So it's neat. Mm-hmm, huh?

630
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,560
 All right

631
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,760

 You must remember this a kiss is still a kiss. It's a as time goes by

636
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,160
 as time goes by

637
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:40,200
 And when two lovers whoo, they still say I love you or that you can't rely

638
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:46,020
 The fundamental things apply

639
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,760
 The colors for 400 this color is this

640
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:59,680
 Tickled me this color ends in our pull

 It's purple could be nurple. It could be it could have been herbal. I would have gotten that one wrong Matt light herbal

644
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:31,040
 This color that I have recently made up ends in herbal I'll go colors for 800 and striat

645
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,600
 Nothing really rhymes with this color, but you can force a half rhyme if needed

646
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,720
 door hinge, that's right

647
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,400
 That's the one that Eminem keeps screaming about

649
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,480

 I'll go with Casablanca again

651
00:54:51,520 --> 00:55:00,220
 For 800 there are three bars in the film Casablanca. This is the primary setting for the movie the Blue Oyster

652
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,600
 Bum bum bum bum bum I

653
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,840
 Think it's just called Rick's but it might have some other

654
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,600
 Name to it and I'm gonna know Rick's Rick's cabaret is that strip club that used to go to in Vegas all the time

655
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,640
 You just got you god. I think it's just Rick's

656
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,840
 I think Rick's cabaret was the strip club in Vegas that got shut down by the city after multiple fatal

657
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,360
 Stabbings in their parking lot in a single month. Oh god

 What about played against Sam's is that one still going? Oh, that's I think it's still playing

659
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,520
 Fucking you can play it again and again

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,340
 Yeah, I think Rick's. Oh, what Rick's Cafe Americana. There we go. I remember before you hit it. Yep

 Because it's a stupid question because it has tea in the middle. It's like I see what you do

667
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,240
 Yeah, Matt

668
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
 Well, I'm stay away from stupid questions

669
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,160

 There are three bars in the film Casablanca, this is the secondary bar in the city of Casablanca

677
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
 Oh, it's gonna get me on this one

678
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,440
 Does that mean it's the secondary bar in the movie or just the secondary bar in the city of Casablanca?

679
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:22,240
 This is the second best bar in the city of Casablanca it was not mentioned in the film

680
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,520
 I mean, maybe not. No, I'm sure it was mentioned in the film

681
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,720
 Rick's - I'll say the cafe the Jazz Bistro

682
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,560

690
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:09,400

773
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,640
 I'll do it and it ended up being this incredibly racist event where everyone brought a bunch of blues and R&B records

774
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:34,760
 To it and then it broke out of this riot, but it was basically racially fueled

775
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:42,280
 So it's one of the most weirdest reported things and it's used as a cornerstone in the disco show where I'm like

776
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:48,920
 That's not what happened as a baby child of the 70s. I remember growing up with that whole disco sucks thing

777
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,840
 Yeah, coming through his baby turns out that whole mantra that whole movement was just anti

778
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:01,280
 LGBTQ I stuff man. It was just oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's all racist and racist

779
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,320
 Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's all just stems from don't let people enjoy

780
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:12,520
 The music that supports their their lifestyle and their culture. It's just awful. It's awful

781
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,320
 This country is crazy Steve doll. Yeah, that's the DJ. I think right Laurie. Yeah

782
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,880
 You know, I think he ended up didn't get in trouble for all that shit

783
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,600
 Well, they're like a lot of destruction of property and stuff that happened on his. Yes

784
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:35,160
 It fucked up like the ballpark and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I think he ended up being on the hook for some financial stuff

785
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,000
 Maybe even did some jail time. I don't know back when there's a bunch of like niche cool podcast companies coming out

786
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 There's one I'm trying to I can't remember remember it now

787
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:49,040
 But there's a podcast that interviewed basically a black usher from Kaminsky Park and his

788
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:54,480
 And in his breakdown of what happened the day disco died. It was a really great podcast

789
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,860
 At one point he basically has to like hide and run

790
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:04,480
 Because of what was happening in the park. What's that on? I have to find it. It's been so long

791
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,140
 It's listen to it forever ago, but obviously that a huge impact on me

792
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,440
 Swedish scoop is saying that was a doubleheader and the second game had to be forfeited

793
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:17,320
 Laurie is saying it was a huge deal, but I believe they had to just call the game. No jail time

794
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,920
 Yeah, oh boy

795
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,600
 Yeah, there you go. All right. Well, let's end on that high note, huh fellas?

796
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:31,960
 We're not just a racist cesspool now we always have been

797

799
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,980
 It's awful. But if you want to help out and maybe I don't know

01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,240
 We can go to sign up for our patreon and you can be part of our experiment
