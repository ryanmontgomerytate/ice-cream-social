00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,020
 That's right. That's right

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,400
 Well, we get it

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
 We're about to set up our trick-and-treat

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,760
 Deal as soon as we wrap here. We'll be going outside the city of our house here. Yeah, same here and

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,560
 I

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,360
 Well, we did a test run last night basically Ryre Applethorne built me a

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:08,320
 Disguised jack-in-the-box giant jack-in-the-box. Yeah, uh-huh. And so yesterday was trunk or treat

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,480
 Over at the school and so everybody had these ornate

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,800
 You know trunk they set up their car trunk designs

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,320
 Yeah, they do like full-on decorations on their cars and everything, right?

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,280
 Yeah, it's a trunk look like a monster mouth or all kind of stuff like that

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
 Yeah, and my wife signed signed me up for it, but we

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,080
 We've been crazy busy. And so I basically had

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,320
 30 minutes to run home and put stuff in my car to make trunk or treat happen and then back to the school

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,680
 I had the Halloween parade that I had to teach a theater workshop to the kids there and then trunk or treat was right after

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
 And so I rolled up in my Corolla

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
 Yeah

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,240
 put down a blanket the skeleton a couple a couple skeletons and

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,840
 then I gave the controls over to my youngest son who scared the shit out of everybody with a jump scare and

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,560
 With with

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,240
 With with with basically no decorations. We got third place in the trunk retreat because we were scared

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,520
 Yes

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,560
 Ryre Appledorn coming through baby. Well, poor Ryre Appledorn. I have to get him on the phone

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,600
 The prop did not hold up to the stress test of a repeated truck or treat thing. Oh really?

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:40,200
 How many how many reps did the Brock get last night I mean

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,600
 50 60 reps. Yeah, you know, I don't normally perform that trick 60 times in an hour

44
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
 Interesting interesting

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:00,040
 Will that my now my son to to his content is the the front door broke off completely and okay

46
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,940
 Then the fish that the clown was holding snapped out of his hand

47
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,160
 And then the finger got of the one clown got caught and something on one of the reloads and snapped a finger

48
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 It was a real

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,400
 And I was also relying on that tonight today so I'm gonna get my neighbor Gary to see if we can fix the front door

50
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,520
 On the on the clown now the clown with a snap finger and a couple of broken things doesn't hurt the

51
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,640
 Doesn't hurt the bit at all. The vibe is still there for the scare. Yeah and

52
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:39,840
 To Ryre's credit he I for no reason he added two giant loud horns to the prop when I didn't ask for that at all

53
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,640
 And it absolutely makes it and my son was way on top of it

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,840
 Just blasting people with the horn on the jump scare and just really good really crushing it and so perfect

55
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,380
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but yes, this is indeed

56
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:05,360
 See if I can put it to put it back together for the for the for the

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,720
 Tonight Donnelly the perfect reading. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,400
 Paul you're already dressed for trick-or-treat you got your you got your Ninja Turtles hat on there

59
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,640
 This is actually a winter to that. I just sport when it gets cold. I was outside doing some chores today

60
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,360
 It's freezing out here. It's in the 40s. You're full on Ninja Turtles hat. I'm sorry. It's not a costume

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,840
 It's just your regular hat. Yeah, it's just a regular hat. I wear my phone. Yeah, of course

62
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,040
 I mean I wore Ninja Turtle pants on the airplane for years

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,200
 That's how that's how I roll. I'll give shit

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,600
 Yeah

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,880
 No, somebody was just asking me if I would open up my own comic book store at some point

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,880
 I don't think I want the hassle. It's too much hassle. Well, my guy my guy is in a new location now and

67
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,720
 It's just been challenge after challenge for him getting it all squared away

68
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,960
 It's a great new space but just brick-and-mortar retails thriving like no other time in history

69
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,200
 Right. No, you know what comic shops are actually doing better this year than they have in a long time. I

70
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,320
 Think they're up something like 30 sure. No, seriously. It's a really believe you but I'm

71
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,000
 That's a not a great comparison to what comic book shops a few years ago weren't doing well at all, right? Uh

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,720
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, they've certainly had their ebbs and flows. Yeah, that's all I mean, but they're yeah, I guess that's true

73
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,520
 I mean, there are a lot of them in town now that you're right there. I've seen a lot of them just pop up

74
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,720
 Anecdotally across Vegas. Yeah coming up coming up from the bottom, but it's a it's a you know, relatively inexpensive form of of

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,320
 entertainment and

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,560
 Every comic book shop has always been a labor of love. There's nobody for sure

77
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,600
 That is nobody open the comic book shop being like and then and then I'll buy my island

78
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,440
 More the more the point when did comic book shops become the collectible shops as well late

79
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,200
 Seven when we were kids, they were they were just comic book shops, right or were they were they already not late 70s?

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 As far as we mean like when it became

81
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,640
 about collectibles about the collectibles now they've got like all that all like the

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,840
 Toys and gimmicks and who have the toys from the different things and there are the collectible toys and the and the Pokemon cards

83
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,080
 And all the things don't make me start listing things. I just sound like an old man

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,320
 There are still some comic shops that are very purist and and really hold mostly

85
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,120
 Books and there are the other things like those toys and things have a good margin on them

86
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,520
 So yeah, everybody kind of felt fair as it out. Yeah

87
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,720
 I'm holding the mug from the wedding the wedding favor mug for the people who nice. Oh nice

88
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,080
 Yeah, Jake, I just got out of there. You went you gotta get it. Yeah

89
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,200
 Yeah, I have they sent me this one. They sent me this non-descript plastic cup that I'm drinking out of. Yeah

90
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,760
 but yeah, we went and

91
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
 Anne and I had a

92
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,800
 Day to go and just kind of do a few little things together

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,320
 she's been working like crazy and

94
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,800
 so we went to get some food at Applebee's and then we went to the comic book store and

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,000
 then we went to try out this new ice cream spot that we have in town and

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,960
 It was great. This new ice cream store is great. And yeah, it's called

97
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,520
 Crispy cone and what really what's your go-to order at an ice cream shop? I'm usually chocolate

98
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,640
 You're just a scoop of chocolate usually but this time the way they do it

99
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,560
 I usually just rob them. They just say give me all the money in the register

100
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,560
 Smart smart. It's very different

101
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,040
 This this place very fancy crunk. Oh, no, he's out there got ice cream shops working for him

102
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,680
 My default is probably chocolate chip cookie dough. That's hands. That's what Anne likes

103
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,480
 Yep, that's what you got. Go to order is a shake

104
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,780
 Okay, shake. Yeah, I want to I want to no labor. No labor for you. Just went down get it done

105
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,620
 No, no, I want to I want to take it. I want to I want to be able to walk and sip

106
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,520
 Enjoy my shake shakes are so good

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,680
 And then I feel so terrible with myself after I have them and I don't know why

108
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,440
 Big one. I I see people order like the huge ones at everything. I'm gonna you are a crazy person. That's me

109
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
 I love me a big big chocolate milkshake. I just want I want a little like hand-sized

110
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,200
 You know, just a little little little shake little little chocolate shake or maybe a vanilla or something like that

111
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,440
 I don't have restraint if I get a shake. It's gone. It's gone

112
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,400
 I yeah, it is it is a it is a two-minute treat and then it is I'm with you on that

113
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,600
 I have no ability to like casually take a cup. You do have to pace yourself on the old shakes a little bit not me

114
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
 Now they could take it down

115
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,440
 That not only will not pace himself on the shakes, but they I got one that was

116
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,800
 What he caught cheesecake, oh

117
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,040
 Yeah, so they put chunks of cheesecake all on the sides of it and then drizzled strawberry syrup all over it

118
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,900
 Really really fucking good. It sounds like a mess

119
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,860
 It was it was really hard to get home and it was really tricky to juggle

120
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,880
 But it was delicious. You must have been an Ann's car. No, we were in my

121
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,440
 That you would have taken that into your own car I

122
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,960
 Know I was like, uh, I had well, here's here's what happened

123
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:39,600
 Paul does not like taking food into his car. I don't we're in we're in the ice cream shop

124
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 And I start to get gurgle belly

125
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,520
 And I and I know

126
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,000
 That time is of the essence

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,380
 The clock has started and we we not only got we each got an ice cream and we got hot chocolates

128
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,840
 So I'm sipping a little bit of hot chocolate eating a little bit of ice cream

129
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,120
 Mixing temperatures should really help really help soothe that belly. Well

130
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,440
 I get in the car and we're and as soon as we're driving I'm like and I

131
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:22,480
 Got a bucket of prunes. I got some stuff going on things are things are happening and she's like you're gonna make it

132
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,320
 You're gonna make it. I'm like, I think so she says are you gonna shit in your cars? I'm not gonna shit in my car

133
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,200
 I just cleaned this car. I spent three hours the other day cleaning and detailing my fucking car

134
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,640
 Good. I'm glad that factor because if you hadn't clean your car, it would have been an option

135
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,080
 Not an option. I haven't cleaned my car in months. I might shit in my car. I don't know I don't know I

136
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,880
 Don't know because here's what happened. We got home. I

137
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,480
 Was in dire straits. I got out of the car. I

138
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,080
 came around the car

139
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:02,640
 Into the house as I'm coming around the side of the car and says are you okay? Are you shitting yourself and I go

140
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,040
 Oh, no

141
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
 As soon as she said it

142
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
 I

143
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,160
 Did she jinxed me and I said, oh no

144
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,420
 She is happening. She manifested it. She dream boarded it. She straight up. This is an impression of me

145
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,640
 She's doing impressions of me all day. She goes it's happening. Oh, no

146
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,640
 And I go running up the stairs

147
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,100
 Filling my pants. I'm throwing my jacket away

148
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,360
 Ripping my belt off trying to save my wallet and keys

149
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,440
 I can feel it ripping out through my underwear into my jeans

150
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,400
 I'm like, this is going to drip on my stairs if I don't get upstairs

151
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,260
 Run up the stairs run up the stairs

152
00:12:52,260 --> 00:13:00,340
 I'm not doing that to my downstairs bathroom. I get upstairs

153
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,080
 Get this moment. I am going to the closest bathroom. I get upstairs. I throw my

154
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,080
 Hands off. I throw everything over to the side. I

155
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,240
 Completely have ruined my pants my jeans my underwear my socks

156
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:24,160
 Everything I sit on the commode and the commode is just the sides are now just

157
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,880
 Terrible terrible soft serve of death

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,020
 And it's just like the stench the stench. I'm like, I know I'm sorry. I can't control

159
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,080
 Matt Matt checked out Matt has left the zoom

160
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,240
 And is laughing and of course at the same time saying I'm sorry

161
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,800
 I know I know I shouldn't be laughing but you're too funny when you're doing this stuff. You're making me laugh. You're killing me smalls

162
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,640
 And I did I made her laugh through the whole thing even though

163
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,440
 Most women would just leave that's what I tell her straight up

164
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,600
 I'm like this is not the first nor the last time I've shit my pants. You haven't just left me. So it's fine

165
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600
 So yeah

166
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,860
 Got through all that laughter. It's just it's just gonna be stuff going to a suitcase. Yeah, that's the trouble

167
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,240
 Yeah, that's gonna be the bad time, but it was fine

168
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
 It took me about an hour to get everything

169
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,260
 So real quick Leon Kasab in the chat just got back in. Hey guys, I just came back

170
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
 Should I recommend this episode for an obelisk?

171
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 Sure

172
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,000
 It sums us up it appeals to a certain demographic I

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,380
 Guess I mean, I'm just I'm just being honest. I'm just being honest

174
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,480
 It was a rough night anyway

175
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,760
 but

176
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,040
 Finally got everything settled down and then yesterday. I cleaned the bathroom top to bottom

177
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,080
 So, you know, I did my part to fix everything. I cleaned the bathroom that day and then I cleaned it again yesterday

178
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
 So, yes, I did need the muffler

179
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,120
 I did not have my muffler muffler would have saved but what a muffler have even would have but a muffler have slowed this down

180
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,980
 Yes, this sounds like too much for a muffler. This was pretty intense. I have to say

181
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,720
 Bourbon barrel like every really

182
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,880
 What are we doing yeah, yeah, I don't know but

183
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,240
 It was just crazy how she was like she seriously was like

184
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,160
 Are you shitting yourself? And then sure enough I was like, oh god, I am

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,840
 Wasn't before I wasn't before and now I am and I didn't make it and it was just hell on earth

186
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,440
 Hell on the car is fine

187
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
 Cars fine. I was clear from the car

188
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,760
 Everything's fine

189
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
 Everything's fine now

190
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:47,360
 Well, no, no some underwear got thrown away. Yeah. Yeah. All right and some socks and

191
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,040
 Well, no, it's not a good story. It's a nice thing. It didn't get to my socks, but

192
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,040
 The socks is an unrelated side effect and some carpeting. No the socks. Here's the sock story

193
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,440
 So I have socks on where I have socks that I've probably been wearing for like ten years some of them and now they're getting

194
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,700
 real rippy. Holy and so

195
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,440
 I

196
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,080
 Was a terrible wrestler in the seventies

197
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,840
 anyway, rippy, holy

198
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,080
 I Bought a bunch of new socks. And so I was like, well as I go through and I find my rippy

199
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,880
 Holy socks, I'll just start throwing them away because I've got a bunch of new socks and

200
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,840
 Just so happens this coincided with me wearing some rippy. Holies for their last time and then and it was so bad

201
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,560
 Taking off everything in such a rush that the top ring of the sock stayed on my foot like a

202
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,120
 Rippy holies. I was trying to get out of my poop filled clothes

203
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,680
 You have tear away socks

204
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,100
 So then I use those socks to start the cleaning process somewhat and threw them away. Oh my god

205
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,600
 Yeah, okay. It was intense. It was an intense afternoon

206
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,920
 It was a heavy heavy day. It was a lot

207
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,800
 So wait, wait, so then was the this Cheesecake Sunday in transit with you while this was happening? Yes

208
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,520
 Yes, I said it on the roof of the car and just left it ran

209
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:28,600
 Didn't even get my hot hot cocos till like an hour later. They were not hot by that time. They were delicious

210
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,960
 So yeah

211
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,800
 yeah, and and got the sundae and put it in a bowl and put it in the freezer for me and then the hot cocos just

212
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,880
 Sat in my car till I was able to come back downstairs and get my hot cocos out of the car

213
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,640

 He's gonna give you a finishing move right on your belly. Yeah

232
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,320
 JD III heard I heard you were coming today. So when I went to do my job

233
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,560
 I stuff cotton in my mouth. I just put a bunch of cotton into my mouth. So I feel like furniture

234
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,760
 It did feel like home. Yeah next time if you could coil a rusty old spring on your tongue

235
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,120
 That would just really put it put it over the edge rusty spring my tag team partner

236
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,680
 He's right here if rusty spring and Rippy Holy, I mean always loved you guys because you did remind me of the old furniture

237
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
 I used to have sex with

238
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,240
 Don't get me in a goodwill that place would get wrecked

239
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,600
 Jacob did you see yes springsteen delivered me from nowhere. I

240
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:22,420
 Attempted to oh and then found out that it wasn't streaming anywhere. It's only in theaters. Oh

241
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,920
 Yeah, you thought you're gonna watch it at home. I sat down last night to watch it and went to pull it up

242
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,520
 It was like oh, it's not streaming here. Oh, it must be on a different service

243
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,600
 I thought I was gonna have to pay for it. I thought it was I thought it was new

244
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,120
 Yeah

245
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,280
 I have not seen it that puppy needs theaters my friend

246
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,600
 That thing needs to blossom slowly

247
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,000
 In the seeds of the tens of 12s of people that are going into theater after theater to see a sin of magic

248
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,220
 I did watch an extended trailer of it last night and I and I listened to

249
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,400
 Nebraska in the count Basie theater

250
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:07,720
 I'll tell you that the extended trailer the extended trailer is probably as good as the movie

251
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,240
 Did genuinely make me want to watch the movie? So I think you might be right. Yeah

252
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,520
 When we saw the movie Paul was a Paul was respectful

253
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,600
 We got the car and he's like are we waiting to get on air to talk about this and I said

254
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,360
 No, we can talk about the car. We just rehashed it on there. Yeah. Yeah, and he goes well, you're the springsteen fans

255
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 I I'll let you talk first

256
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:39,680
 You should start Paul said and with this conversation I defer I defer. Yes, I yield the floor

257
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,560
 To the gentleman from New Jersey. So I'm willing to have this conversation

258
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 I'm gonna need you to set the tone first of all spoilers

259
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,980
 Let's just yes set that out here now spoilers for deliver me from nowhere, which I can't believe that fucking subtitle

260
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
 It is meaningless

261
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,240
 Meaningless

262
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,480
 It's a lyric reference, but besides that it is meaningless. Yes

263
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,080
 Here's the thing that really sums up this movie for me

264
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,800
 I'm watching the film and I'm getting you know as emotionally invested as one can when watching the boss

265
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,120
 Deal with this stuff

266
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
 He's got this long time relationship

267
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
 multiple-year relationship happening on screen

268
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:34,720
 With this woman and her child and he's very much been to become like a father figure to this kid here and there and you

269
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,120
 Know all this kind of thing and also just might be to say that that actor Odessa figure the last name is

270
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,840
 She's Australian

271
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,300
 She kills it. She steals the movie as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, she was great and I was like, okay Matt

272
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
 So who was this lady?

273
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,600
 Why didn't they stay together what what's what's that? What's the fallout from that? Oh, that says

274
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,760
 She's a composite character of multiple ways

275
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:12,860
 This movie forever then yeah, yeah because he doesn't even come off that nice to a composite of his

276
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:21,960
 When out of its way to fictionalize Springsteen leading on a woman with a child and ditching her that's

277
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,600
 It is the oddest shit the choices they make are just like if I'm gonna submit my legacy. It's a superstar

278
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,020
 I should put out a movie where I'm absolutely

279
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:40,920
 Atrocious. Yeah the most sympathetic people in the world a single mother a single working mother in a diner

280
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,840
 Like somebody said somebody in a writing room somewhere said like no

281
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,640
 No, we have to we have to do that like he was convinced to keep that bit in the movie

282
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,680
 I'm sure I don't know man. It's so weird movie

283
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,840
 Right if you just was just old-school movie making

284
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,880
 Right, right. You are supposed to ride the dip of that and then that person is supposed to evolve and come back to being a better person

285
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,480
 and

286
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 There are scenes that set it up

287
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,900
 Dramatically so where they follow all the rules of film writing right up to that that that cliff

288
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,880
 Where the house supposed to turn around and do make the better choice

289
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,620
 It's like nope. Anyways, he went on to go do some concerts. Yeah, it's the craziest thing

290
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:34,320
 He he what happened to that mother and child who knows who knows he meets up with her at a diner where she's been working

291
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,600
 Has this big heartfelt conversation was she the best he had ever had not even close. She cries and

292
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,960
 Says she's a heartfelt speech like just pierces right through all of his bullshit

293
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,680
 Like I hope you find what you're looking for and he's gone. That's it. He never even talks to her again the rest of the movie

294
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,720
 She never shows up again. He leaves her he leaves her crying next to a dishwashing machine. That's it. It's over

295
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,280
 That's the last thing she said. There's a scene later

296
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,160
 The movie is that scene like 90 minutes left. Yeah. Yeah. Oh

297
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,120
 Yeah, it's almost over

298
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,200
 Like he's just like well, it's a build-up to this moment and this moment is where that

299
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,800
 Should make him break down and make the right choice, right? And it's that it's like but that's not what happened in real life

300
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 So goodbye and then

301
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:33,480
 Sure, let me composited this together. He even has this epic road trip, which is which is hysterically

302
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,720
 Factual and that spring she never drove so someone had a drive to California

303
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,480
 Springsteen and Copperfield are two two huge celebrities who just never really drove

304
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,240
 and

305
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:55,120
 Like muddling in the diner with his food in the middle of like, you know El Paso or something and he's going like she's right

306
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,760
 She's right

307
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
 But he doesn't act on it

308
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:09,980
 Moves on as though she had never spoken. He doesn't even move on. It's he is absolutely

309
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
 Just feather on the wind

310
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,000
 He does not do anything he directs little anything in this film

311
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,840
 Aside from recording an album in his bedroom

312
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:30,280
 That's the only thing that he really does and then that same that same moment of him being out in this

313
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,920
 Road trip the guy after he's seen him get all upset with his food

314
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,680
 gets on the horn to the manager and

315
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,200
 Comically, it's the springsteen is like five feet away from

316
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,100
 He's like, I don't know he's gone off the deep end

317
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:59,120
 It's the dumbest thing you've ever seen

318
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:07,960
 It's like they want to talk about all the the the darkness in his soul, but it never really it's just I mean

319
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,500
 They they delve into his childhood abuse

320
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,120
 okay, but

321
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
 It's just it's just

322
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,640
 abuse in a way that is like if we if you and I went to film school and we're like

323
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,480
 How how do we want to want to show you boost?

324
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,240
 Let's cut to black and white and do the most like standard bad dad

325
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,760
 Scenes you've ever seen in your and the bad dad

326
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,040
 His bad dad is a character actor who's been in a lot of stuff and most notably

327
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,440
 He plays Italian gangsters and he played Capone and I want to say boardwalk Empire

328
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,400
 I could bone and also in adolescence. He's the tough dad and

329
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,640
 Adolescence the oh is a big hit the big hit on Netflix that for okay

330
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,480
 So he's very pigeon-holed like you see him and you're already like oh

331
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,360
 His father was Al Capone. Okay bad guy bad guy

332
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,240
 and

333
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,360
 Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. I would say has a breakdown at an amusement park. It's

334
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,300
 Like you know even Graham is that actor's name. Yes. He's great

335
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,680
 Stephen Graham he was really good

336
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,760
 Look, you know like he put out he put out this big autobiography and there's a big deal

337
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,160
 He does one person show on Broadway and where he was more candid than he'd ever been about his childhood

338
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,540
 and this is you know, he was he is the child of an abusive father and

339
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,680
 You know as a rock star, you know that obviously has a different, you know, weird weird way of sitting with people

340
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,600
 but uh, you know, I

341
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,480
 Said to Paul I said basically if you took

342
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:54,560
 Like this moment, right? This is a moment basically like spacing is finally which with the mood is get into but he's passed his lawsuits

343
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,220
 He can finally put out music again

344
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,840
 He can finally tour again puts up the river the rivers huge and they're begging him to like come back with another killer album

345
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,320
 And he instead takes this artistic right turn puts up the brass gal and all that stuff is true

346
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,360
 And it's crazy. And so like that is a weird turn and like and I said to Paul like anytime

347
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,400
 Springsteen fans talk to non springsteen fans, and they say he's just a cheesy rocker

348
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:25,520
 Most the first words out of most springsteen fans his mouth is something about Nebraska like that album is this totally different turn

349
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,500
 With with beautiful storytelling and songwriting in it that's not pop, right?

350
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
 and and so

351
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,620
 You know to tell that story as a moment of triumph, you know

352
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:46,420
 artistically is maybe fascinating and kind of like basically then you pit yourself against the record people and the pressures and all the people want

353
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,900
 To be super famous that feels like more of like a typical story and then he's battling depression during this time

354
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,860
 That feels like that would be like an underlying kind of B story, right and instead this movie makes the

355
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,840
 artistic choice to put up the Nebraska album against all the pressures of fame as this kind of

356
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:11,260
 Dragging B story while we watch this very in-depth arc of depression in the Jersey Shore

357
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:20,620
 Where the only solution is to run away and move to California forever and like she and like that's not a movie anybody wants

358
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
 to see about anyone

359
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,120
 Right. Yeah, so that's that's that's my sum up of it

360
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,540
 They flipped the a and the B stories in a way that was so strange

361
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,680
 It's just it's it's a weird movie. It's not a bad movie

362
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,560
 No, but it's not a good movie. No, it's a problem

363
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,760
 Another thing we said in the car was was like it's as if like a bunch of actors got together and we're like

364
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,320
 I want to make a movie where all of us get scenes where we get to act our faces. Oh, man

365
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,200
 It is acting happening in those fucking moat. Oh my god. Yeah, there's some people just really acting hard

366
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,320
 acting

367
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,200
 Well, I feel bad for the you know, the bear Jeremy Allen white or whatever like, you know

368
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:10,860
 You know your your basic book on screenwriting is in the scene a character should feel different

369
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,520
 Than it does in the beginning of a scene, right?

370
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,760
 So it starts off feeling one way and by the end of scene it feels another because that's how we're watching that interaction

371
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
 That's that's we're watching

372
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,020
 Situations where people can possibly change right? That's what makes compelling voyeuristic

373
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,920
 Scenic acting movie making work and there are so many scenes where

374
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:38,980
 Bruce's the same exact mood at the start of the scene at the end of nothing changes nothing changes in the same

375
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,840
 So nothing affects him. No

376
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,560
 But I did just find out that

377
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,400
 Matt did you know that the Nebraska and in cold blood were about the same events? Yes, I

378
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,920
 Think I think am I the only one who didn't know that I think that common knowledge as a matter of fact

379
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:05,480
 I believe if you listen back to our Halloween episode Jacob just the last episode when Truman Capone stopped by I did indeed ask him

380
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
 About that he did

381
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,560
 It's the start. It's the Starkweather murders. Yeah, it's clear that I wasn't listening at that moment of the last show

382
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,420
 You're juggling. You're juggling characters popping by the doorbell. I get it. I'm just letting you know that

383
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,880
 Karen and Georgia evidence. I just found that out this week

384
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,000
 I didn't I didn't know that Karen and Georgia on my favorite murder just recently covered the Starkweather shit. It's awful and

385
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,920
 Yes for a lot, but for a long time it was framed as this sort of Bonnie and Clyde type situation

386
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,640
 Yeah, all right sure more and more we're learning. This was a 13 year old girl who watched her parents murdered in front of her

387
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,680
 Yeah, not like she really had a choice, but to go with the psychopath. Oh, no. No, it's it's horrible. It's dark

388
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,120
 It's dark shit, but but I mean it turns out that story of murder is a bad story well, but

389
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,180
 But the fact that we lumped a poor little girl in on it

390
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,600
 This country's just fucking dumb

391
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,920
 Look at all the things that make this country

392
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,480
 It wasn't the Starkville murders

393
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,760
 Stark weather murders that they didn't just blame him a 13 year old dragged along for some murders. I think we have indeed figured it out

394
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,280
 I think we've righted that wrong ball. I think that's maybe maybe I guess I don't know

395
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:34,480
 Paul Paul Paul I got you the country is in trouble and those murders were horrible. Yes, those are both true

396
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,720
 Okay, they might not be related

397
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,480
 I don't know it feels like in a lot of ways it feels like he's just misogyny all the way down

398
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,600
 That's what it really feels like I went to I told you guys a couple of months ago. I went down to

399
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,520
 Prim to look at some of the casinos down there

400
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,520
 Just so we can just kind of walk through some of the casinos down there before they shut down right and one of the casinos

401
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,720
 Down there has the Bonnie and Clyde car. Yeah, where they were where they were shot to death and

402
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,840
 You know, it's got all the bullet holes and everything and it's a tourist attraction and I just stood there and looked at this thing

403
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
 I was like this this car

404
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,760
 was

405
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,960
 two people's death site

406
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,200
 the evidence of them of them dying is still here and

407
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,880
 They they killed people and they robbed people and they hurt people and they and they did all these things

408
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,760
 This is not this is not a nice story

409
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,400
 And I and I just kind of stood there being disgusted that this car was on display for people to come over and look at

410
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,840
 That's me with the Mob Museum people love going to my museum

411
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:43,160
 there's a little like a little little like a mini doc that runs throughout the whole time and there's one words mafia guy is

412
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,160
 is talking about being a consultant on a De Niro movie and

413
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,480
 They're reenacting the murder and he's describing like how the murder went down and they're like, oh, they're like, oh man

414
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,200
 It's got the way he's describing. It's like he actually was there and it's like, oh, isn't that awesome? No. Yeah, it's fucking

415
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,360
 Yeah, he was actually there. He was there and he committed fucking brutal murder. I don't know why yeah, that's a

416
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,000
 I don't know why that's a taint tickler for you. Oh because Matt, it's the it's the fedora

417
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,040
 If you're wearing a fedora

418
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,760
 Cosa Nostra, that's right. That's right. Oh, and he's not black. It's those it's those two things put together. Oh, man

419
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,200
 Speaking of Vegas icons

420
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,720
 Sarah has to Ross was filming a music video and

421
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,300
 Yeah, yeah, and I was asked if I would play

422
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,640
 Not Elvis. This is key, but a Fremont Street Elvis impersonator. That's that's the key there

423
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,960
 Oh, yeah, that is. Yeah, there's a degree in casting there

424
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:53,600
 And if you need an Elvis Matt Donnelly is not your guy if you need somebody on Fremont Street impersonating Elvis Matt Donnelly

425
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,160
 so I

426
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,720
 My wife

427
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,280
 Mistakenly thought I still had this Elvis outfit that I used to have

428
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,640
 But it eventually just like weathered away became, you know, I feel like she wore it out

429
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,400
 Honestly, if we if we're just telling the truth, it's like she just she just fucked the shit out of

430
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,320
 Well, I'm gonna call I'm gonna screen it but

431
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,320
 My friend Jeff calls it's Nevada Day

432
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,280
 here, that's right and

433
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,600
 My friend Jeff knows all the words than the Nevada Day song the Nevada the Nevada anthem

434
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,000
 Any calls every single friend who still lives in Nevada every Nevada Day and sings the entire song into their voicemail

435
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,040
 And so I have that that's what's happening right now. It's my favorite thing

436
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,300
 One of the more fun things about Nevada is that became a state on Halloween. Yeah

437
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,520
 Anyhow, so

438
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,520
 So I went down to star costume and I was like this is actually is nothing to do with Halloween

439
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
 I need I need an Elvis costume

440
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,360
 and so I look and

441
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,160
 In in my sizes they had this really nice red one, it's really nice red one say, okay

442
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,040
 That looks really sharp. It was it was a little pricey

443
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,080
 But I've been asked to dress up like Elvis on multiple occasions and I don't know if it was figured

444
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,200
 You're gonna get another run out of this. Oh, this was a purchase not a not a rental, right? This is a purchase because also

445
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,000
 When I did Virgin Voyages and I hopefully that went well enough that they'll invite me back

446
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,620
 They do a thing called scarlet night where everyone dresses in red

447
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,140
 And I was like, wait a minute

448
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,520
 One I can wear this. Yeah

449
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,720
 On the Virgin Voyages represent in Vegas. That'll look yeah. Yeah

450
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,520
 and so yeah, I bought myself a nice Elvis outfit and then went down to

451
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,800
 Fremont and I was like, hey, you guys are just shooting on the street, right? She's like, yeah

452
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,640
 Like so there's no like dressing area. She's like knows like so basically I should arrive as Elvis

453
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
 They're like, yeah, okay

454
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,760
 so

455
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,960
 Me which coincidentally is the same note that every person who hires Matt to do any gig tells

456
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,800
 I knew to ask I knew

457
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,520
 It's so common. My my my tear my tear of

458
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,800
 Acting is so familiar that I know be like no dressing rooms, right? No makeup

459
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,660
 Right is an AAE actor is what they call it arrives as Elvis

460
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
 I

461
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,040
 was just walking up and down Fremont Street dressed I had to tow his Elvis and

462
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,240
 Anyone look at you twice?

463
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
 No, people were loving it

464
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,800
 Loving it. And so then I did this at this bit of a Sarah that when the music video comes out

465
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,620
 I think it's gonna look great. So I won't spoil it, but it was super fun and

466
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:50,000
 As I'm walking back to my car a guy literally goes like hey

467
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
 Are you?

468
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,040
 Are you like doing stuff here? And I was like, no, no, sorry

469
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,800
 I'm just I just actually just got a music video and I'm just walking back to my car. He was okay

470
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,760
 Um, can I take a photo of you anyway?

471
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:13,880
 Sure and he's like you like gets down like it's a good angle or whatever. Yeah, it's like

472
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,680
 Sorry, I mean, can I do is like a self selfies? Okay, is this selfie? Okay, and I was like, yeah, let's let's do it man

473
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,440
 We took a nice selfie whatever and he was like I got to give you some money

474
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:33,760
 This is you better say

475
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,640
 You've had a wonderful person I was like

476
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,400
 Did you take some money? I hope you took some fucking money. This is the thing

477
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,240
 I told the story to Sarah and she goes how much you make I said I said no, no, I'm okay

478
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
 I want to just want to get home to my kids, you know and

479
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,840
 Uh

480
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,240
 Sarah was like you you're a fool. Yeah

481
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,160
 And I was like, I know I'm dumb every person I talked to it has been like

482
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,800
 What was gonna give you it? I was like, I don't know. I don't who knows you probably get a hundred bucks

483
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,640
 I doubt it, but you never know man. People are crazy out there. No Jordan Campbell says this is how Matt started on his only fans

484
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,880
 Jordan this did feel

485
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,320
 It did feel like a moment of like I often gonna rack my brain if I could like make extra money or whatever

486
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,240
 it's all the idea if I could just get on a free street just like

487
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:30,200
 It felt like too easy like that's it was like I literally was like trying to not do it and then someone stopped and like

488
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,180
 Made sure they are funny and I was getting a lot of attention

489
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:40,560
 You know, I was walking with purpose to like not get stopped, but I was causing a lot of attention walking up and down

490
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,840
 Pretty much three dressed at the toe is Elvis. Yeah, so real talk

491
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,280
 I think you might be able to make some money doing this especially in like the earlier hours on Fremont Street

492
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,320
 Not like 2 a.m. But like the 10 p.m. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm thinking like 9 or 10

493
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,660
 I'm thinking like early early night time and but when the families are still out

494
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,800
 Yeah

495
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,680
 Because the people the people taking pictures with people on Fremont Street

496
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,340
 If you don't want someone to be naked in your photograph, you're out of luck

497
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,320
 Like you're just you're just out of luck. Yeah, or if you don't like palm

498
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,120
 Crucifixes palm crucifixes are naked people like you do often crucifixes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

499
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,220
 So everybody's down there though. I did stop and watch a street magician

500
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,160
 How was it form for a few minutes? He was really good. He was really good. Well, that's good news

501
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,420
 It's after some money in his bucket. He was great

502
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:40,960
 It's hard because there's there's music playing at all kinds of volumes the entire time. Yeah, sometimes it's super loud. Sometimes it's just loud

503
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,680
 This guy was a genius. I thought about that while I was watching him. He did it most of it

504
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,440
 He did silently right? That's that's what it would take. Yeah

505
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,640
 I saw a guy doing that that kind of like over there. They're all silver and money moves them kind of oh, yeah

506
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:02,600
 Yeah with a magic trick kind of attached to that and I was like, yeah, that's all we can do down there. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah

507
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,880
 So, yeah, I don't know

508
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,880
 Just the second time just to see what it's like to actually give it a shot really

509
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,240
 I think I also want you to go down there without getting a spot reserve for yourself

510
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,280
 And I want to see if you get some shit for not having a reserved spot

511
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,920
 You probably will if you that's the thing if you do it with the intention of getting paid you won't get paid

512
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,200
 right people talk about it all the time like when when when folks hit the skids and

513
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,880
 They're out on the street begging for money like the first day they feel like oh

514
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,080
 We're gonna be alright here. And then after that is this weird beginners luck thing and it just gets really hard

515
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,280
 Yeah, yeah, that is a lot of stories. That is a lot of people's stories. You're right. It's all attitude

516
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,180
 I think it's all the attitude

517
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,680
 I think I think people can I don't even know how to say it because I don't know what it is

518
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,960
 But but I think that people can

519
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:07,120
 Sense that what the one thing is soon as you are desperately as soon as you're actually desperate

520
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,360
 That's that rippy holy energy. Yeah

521
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:17,060
 I'll tell you who else has got that rippy holy energy and that's the following sponsor

522
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:25,520

 Okay

541
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,120
 I

542
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:27,720
 Really sucked him on that last one there Paul Chamberlain just left the room. It was an unintentional Wallachian impression

543
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,180
 I did well, I guess while Sean is just a squirrel

544
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,840
 I did sound remarkably like all

545
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,440
 I've never seen one Sean and a squirrel in a room together. So I can't I can't say for sure that he's not a squirrel

546
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,860
 I was trying to surprise you did play to my recorder

547
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,740
 So Jacob is this already played to my recorder, but I was playing the home is Nevada

548
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,840
 They think this big if I get them both my mics here

549
00:45:49,840 --> 00:46:16,160
 Who's that singing Jeff my friend Jeff well done Jeff. Yeah got some pipes on him

550
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

551
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:25,120
 Oh

552
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,040
 Go ahead Jacob. Oh

553
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,040
 I was just gonna tag on to the end of Fremont Street. I did see a

554
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,800
 While I was down there the other day. I did see a

555
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,800
 Parent who was watching a performance

556
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,200
 Whose child I would guess?

557
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:46,600
 Six or seven was just sitting on the on the ground at Fremont Street

558
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,920
 While the parent was watching something kind of over there, you know a couple of feet away. Mm-hmm

559
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,440
 It's the first time I've ever wanted to call CPS on any wait now. Oh

560
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:03,240
 The parent was letting your small child just sit on the on the on the street on Fremont Street

561
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,160
 That's that's already disgusting. Yeah, pretty gross

562
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,800
 Yeah, I was I was not okay what captured their attention so much. Was it one of the giant gorillas?

563
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,320
 No, it was just one of the bands. It was just it was just music going. The band was great

564
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,080
 But you see any of the giant gorillas while you're down there, man

565
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,160
 No, that's any giant girls. There really it really wasn't actually a lot going on. I know I

566
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,460
 Haven't been down there in months without seeing at least three or four giant gorillas. I wasn't I was surprised at how little I mean

567
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,640
 We were there. It was a you know, it was I was there from around

568
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,760
 Like 330 to five maybe it's like 530

569
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,440
 I

570
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,720
 Surprised how little was going on?

571
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,200
 Like I said, there's a lot of a lot of unhoused people just sitting in the spots that were designated for performers

572
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,960
 Yeah begging and then some some some some some crucifixes and then the one guy painted in silver

573
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,240
 His bit. Oh

574
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,680
 This was also a Tuesday

575
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,040
 Maybe don't wake up till later. That's probably that's I mean, that's very possibly true. Yeah, also

576
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,860
 I also went to disco the other night

577
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:20,400
 Oh nice and drove down and not since I moved here in 2008 where I stick those back roads to paradise and Koval to get

578
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
 down to the Venetian

579
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,680
 Boy, no one just absolutely no cars. Just driving around absolutely nothing

580
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,080
 I've never seen the streets so empty. That's nice. And then I pulled right into the link and

581
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,640
 Got in the very first row of self parking just a space wide open for me at seven o'clock at night

582
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 Rumors are true Vegas is dead

583
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,080
 Or everybody is avoiding Matt

584
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,440
 No, I don't think that's it. I could not believe how little

585
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:01,680
 There was anyone around in Las Vegas. That's so like I drive down those streets all the time and they are packed all the time

586
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,240
 Yeah, yeah

587
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:14,080
 I have to go down there to fucking the flamingo which has gotten even harder to get to now, which is crazy. I

588
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,000
 Should note that they did start building the f1 track. So it could just be a lot of people just avoiding

589
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,760
 But that might be it

590
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,160
 But also yeah, there was that I mean I walked up and down the link

591
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:33,680
 I was very surprised that that just kind of that's kind of crazy, man. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of crazy. It was weird

592
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,320
 It's anecdotal, but it's weird. Sure still

593
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:42,280
 Still I'm gonna go see disco tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I haven't seen it since since the revamp

594
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:49,480
 Oh, I think yes, I think you'll dig it. I'm looking forward to it. I'll tell you though. He recently added

595
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,600
 our friends D and

596
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,640
 Great grace

597
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:02,800
 Created these clown characters to perform around the venues that are around disco not in the venue itself

598
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,760
 The two other people were doing their bit

599
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,160
 where they're just oh, yeah, two giant disco balls wearing capes and disco mustaches and

600
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,840
 They were killing it. I didn't know I didn't know these people were which is weird

601
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,240
 I'm surprised. Oh good. There's two people that were just being that I need to find out who they were

602
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:29,920
 But they were being hysterical so people came out of I always get nervous when people create bits like like Dean Grace did and then

603
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,200
 Kind of hand them off, right? The handoff always makes me nervous. I'm glad to hear that. It's going really well

604
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,680
 Yes, and so they were just doing a thousand bits and that people nice falling over laughing and I was like, this is great

605
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:50,560
 I'm really looking forward to it. This is gonna be great. Yeah, it's a fun show. I really like that show

606
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:58,200
 It's so different and but it's really cool now. It's super it's super streamlined and it just goes and our friend

607
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,200
 Eli is the host

608
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,480
 and

609
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,480
 He's just so funny. He's just a funny like a full person. Yeah. Well, that's one reason I'm going tomorrow is

610
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,000
 Our another friend of ours. Nick is in for Eli. I've seen Nick do it. Nick's great at it. Nick is great at that

611
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,040
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Nick from banana fame at scoop fest. Yes will be in disco tomorrow. I drank his milkshake

612
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,680
 You did you drink it up? I

613
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,080
 left a little on the floor for Jonas's wheel, but

614
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,760
 a little surprise for Jonas later

615
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,040
 Surprise

616
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:43,460
 But the answer is yes, I'll be dressing up like Elvis tonight for my trick-and-treat I'll be Elvis in my neighborhood and yes

617
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,800
 I was just about to ask you how long are you because I know what time your trick-and-treat is starting today

618
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,220
 I saw your wife last night and she said that you guys are starting at 3 p.m. Today

619
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,600
 Well, how late are you planning on going?

620
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,100
 We usually go to like 9 or 10. Usually the streets get pretty empty at 9

621
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:04,560
 Okay, and then I just run in a front yard party until until until the streets get rolled up

622
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,540
 We have a set time here. It's it's 6 to 8

623
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:13,540
 Yeah, yeah, that's something the high mark, but people come early some people have little kids they go early

624
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:19,420
 Well, it's the light out and then also just you know teenagers and all these other kids that go late and for me for the trick

625
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,420
 And treating I like the teenagers. Yeah

626
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

627
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,520
 for

628
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,160
 Magic trick purposes not for yeah. Sure. Yeah

629
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,640
 Yeah, it's better to deal with I don't know why Matt thinks I mean something else. I'm talking about his magic trick

630
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,160
 No, he's teenagers. I love his magic. I put an audience and we disappear

631
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:47,160
 You want an audience that has grasped the concept of object permanence? That's right before you perform magic. That's correct

632
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,280
 Matt's baby magic didn't go well

633
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,440
 Yeah, and my my my my big ringer when should I fix the clown in time for it to be a jump scare?

634
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,440
 That'd be great. And then I

635
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:08,360
 Got a duck a wooden duck that whoa pecks at cards and and snatches your card out of a deck of cards

636
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
 Oh, that's pretty good. Whoa

637
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,600
 Is it like one of the one of the happy bird? Yes. Well, no, no, no nice

638
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,480
 It's like it's like a wooden it's like an ornate wooden

639
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,320
 This isn't you'd see it like a kitschy like like a cracker barrel lawn decoration, right?

640
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,840
 but it has it has a

641
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:31,040
 Mechanical neck so you push the okay you push the duck's head down and it's just and it just

642
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,360
 Opens beacon snatches a card out of a deck of cards. Oh, I wish my wife had that

643
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:43,640
 What it's a what it's an old it's an old it's an old old magic prop. I just bought one. Oh, it is. Okay

644
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,760
 Yeah, it's a known thing that the done. Yeah, the duck card picker it be duck. I think it's called. Yeah

645
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:56,400
 Yeah hippie duck dip dippy duck dippy duck dippy duck. That makes sense. Yeah. Hippie dippy duck is a whole different thing

646
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,280
 Yeah, you guys want to lose scoop mail, yes, please let's go let's do a little scoop mail

647
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,560
 From winter scoop, this is something I've been wanting to talk about for a week

648
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,160
 Now the jewelry heist at the Louvre has my brain screaming

649
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,320
 The guys use the construction ladder to access a balcony to bypass the front doors

650
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:26,280
 They were work vests and helmets and stole the jewelry after the place opened up guests watched them do it and nobody said anything

651
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:33,480
 They just assumed that they were guys. They're working doing their job the balls on those guys. That's from winter scoop winter scoop

652
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,800
 I'm genuinely concerned that the robbers of the Louvre are scoops. I

653
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:48,000
 Have been advocating bring a ladder for years that you can get in anywhere. These people just took that to the nth degree

654
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,560
 So I heard also apparently that that kind of apparatus that long ladder

655
00:54:53,560 --> 00:55:00,760
 Hooked to a little scooter cart kind of deal is a lot more commonplace out in France because the buildings are so old

656
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:06,160
 That they don't have proper places for you to unload cargo in a lot of these places

657
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,980
 Sure. Sure. So it's not like in the states if you saw somebody with a ladder up to a window you go

658
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,840
 Wait a minute

659
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,840
 right, maybe I

660
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,840
 Tell you how you I'll tell you I'll tell you you need

661
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:27,040
 One thing to make it where people don't give you that look in the states when you're when you're doing that and that is an orange

662
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,240
 Road cone next to the ladder. Yeah, you're right

663
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,320
 I mean that you put a single orange road cone next to the ladder

664
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,640
 You're done. The safety vest thing really does a lot does a lot of work. Yep

665
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,640
 And if you got a radio like you can just flush this whole thing out. I

666
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,920
 Think this could happen all the time. I'm really surprised. This doesn't happen more often

667
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:52,440
 Like you just fit in you just fit in and go do whatever you want

668
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,440
 Let's see we got one I

669
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,920
 Know people that in magician's world who are thinking that it's a it's secretly a ploy to advertise now

670
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,120
 You see me the new now you see me movie coming up. Oh

671
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,520
 Could be

672
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,640
 That's an elaborate

673
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,560
 Well

674
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,280
 Was Gabriella one of the Louvre robbers

675
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:23,320
 Jesse Eisenberg is donating a kidney as part of his promotional work, I guess

676
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,880
 What? Yeah. Yeah, Jesse. Eisenberg is donating kidney to a stranger and

677
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:37,360
 The bit is they stole his kidney. No, he's just big and what is it with these magicians and donating blood Matt? What's going on?

678
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,160
 Does playing with cards enough make you just say that off got way too much blood in me

679
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:49,640
 I'm blanking on her name. She made a documentary about this basically like how it's been it's difficult

680
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,520
 Some very healthy people have two functioning kidneys and if you are a very good health

681
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,300
 you don't need them both so to speak right and there are a lot of people who need kidneys and

682
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:06,160
 Just did the one on the Satanic temple

683
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,580
 Oh, you know what Penny Lane Penny Lane Penny Lane that did a doc on this

684
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:20,440
 She found it very difficult to try to donate your kidney to a stranger. She I remember her doing this doc

685
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:26,280
 I never got to see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She did a doc about about like rent not even random donations

686
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,260
 But like random anonymous donations of organs, right?

687
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,440
 Yes

688
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,960
 So basically like a lot of times you can put out calls if you need a kidney then then your friends and neighbors or friends

689
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,320
 Or friends you put a campaign to do it and that's how right most kidney donation works

690
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,280
 But when it comes to just saying like hey, I

691
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,200
 Have an extra kidney find someone who needs it for me that that operation wasn't streamlined

692
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,960
 But that has improved over the years and so now

693
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,400
 People who just kind of are you know, if you're generally, you know, like I said, you don't drink

694
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,240
 You don't really do too much crazy shit and you can just be a healthy person

695
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:08,160
 You can go go without go without one of those kidneys. No one has ever asked me for one of my kidneys. Oh

696
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,140
 No, I don't know why it's never come up yeah one of your marinated kidneys

697
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,880
 Ten scoop in the chat mentions. It's even harder to donate if you bring it in a cooler

698
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,420
 Mine I've been sitting on this thing for a week. Come on

699
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,640
 YouTube tutorials and now

700
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,380
 You made me fill my bathtub up with ice for nothing

701
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:37,200
 Cost me like $23 to get all that ice

702
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:46,300
 We got one from pigases hey Matt Paul and Jacob, thank you guys and especially all the safety cones helper scoops and performers

703
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:52,540
 For putting together another incredible scoop fest. It was amazing seeing so many weird and wonderful scoops

704
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,540
 There is a great mix of new and old

705
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:01,240
 Older scoops that hang out with and go on adventures with it's incredible how you can not see a scoop for 18 months and pick

706
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:06,260
 Right back up where you left off from the last scoop fest podcast trivia battles and variety shows

707
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,240
 Especially Hollywood squares were some of the very best ever

708
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,480
 Although I'm going to try to avoid being conned into sitting in the front from now on

709
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,480
 Quick scoop vest that basically proves that I'm a potato

710
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:24,140
 Sunday night after scoop fest I was in an elevator at the Orleans when two very friendly and drunk women hopped on

711
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,840
 They noticed my hot dog necklace right away said how much they liked it and we chatted a bit between floors

712
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,680
 They were on vacation and clearly having a great time while I stood there being well me when I got off the elevator

713
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,160
 I ever heard one of them say to the other it's okay

714
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
 I guess he doesn't want a party

715
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,720
 It wasn't until much later at McMullin's that I realized what was actually happening in that elevator

716
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,320
 I just thought they were being polite. I'm already looking forward to the next one

717
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,020
 It was great meeting so many new scoops and reconnecting with returning scoop

718
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,720
 Thanks again for all the hard work you do to make scoop message a unique and fun gathering

719
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:06,120
 Pegasus will fly again fucking you in the face. That's Roger aka the nest scream our nest creamer aka Pegasus

720
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:10,640
 All right. Thanks Roger sounds like you saved yourself about six to eight hundred bucks, buddy

721
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:17,440
 It's really true. It's probably like you all know you probably were almost about to get rolled

722
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:23,820
 You never know in Vegas, and you know, I think Orleans. It was 350. I thought well, I think I think I

723
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,320
 Know for myself just come on

724
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,720
 You just kind of default to the no way. This is not happening. This is some candy camera bullshit. I

725
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:39,800
 Have had multiple friends think that they were doing very well with women

726
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,960
 Then to realize on their own that they were talking to prostitutes

727
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,440
 That's happened to multiple friends of mine and they're sad every time it happens

728
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,400
 They still pay for the sex and everything. They still do that

729
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,040
 It's a blow to their ego first

730
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,640
 It's a blow to their ego that it's a boat

731
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,600
 Good day. Good deal fair. Oh

732
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,440
 Let's see, oh there's another scoop me or another

733
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:15,200
 What does it think we do scoop fest no I don't need to do the scoop best email right now from bear scoop

734
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,840
 Hey, Matt Paul and Jacob in the same vein as the he did what and other tales

735
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,600
 I decided to write in with my story of it's actually what a

736
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,880
 Time well one of many when my sheer stupidity revealed itself in true glory

737
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:36,080
 For context I live in a somewhat big city not far from Vancouver BC and for years

738
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,880
 No decades my commute to and from work

739
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,420
 I would routinely see a box truck think a u-haul like a three or four ton with words

740
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,680
 diamond delivery

741
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:52,020
 Plastered on the side and back which of course was of course a picture of a huge diamond in the middle now

742
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,640
 I don't know if I was just in the monotony of my commute every time I saw these trucks

743
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,840
 But I always assumed that I made up a story that of course these trucks needed to be this big

744
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:06,240
 they were delivering diamonds throughout my 1 to 2 million population bustling metropolis and

745
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,560
 The safe the safes used to do this probably take up most of the back of these trucks

746
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:18,120
 That was until my early to mid 30s when I saw one of these trucks parked in my townhouse complex outside another unit

747
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:23,000
 I found this odd as why would a residential customer be having diamonds be shipped to them

748
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,980
 Oh dear God as I see them taking plants furniture another crap out of the back of the truck

749
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:32,840
 Diamond delivery is a delivery company not a diamond delivery company

750
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:41,260
 So anyway, that's my it's actually what story fucking with the face. That's a bear scoop

751
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:46,280
 Thank you bear scoop. Yeah, I

752
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:53,500
 For a little while when I was a kid. We used to have Schwann's did you go? Yeah Schwann's meal delivery?

753
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:59,220
 Yeah, yeah, the refrigerated trucks and everything. I thought it was delivering swans

754
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:03,760
 I thought these people are getting are getting geese

755
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,280
 Swans delivery service. Yeah. Yeah

756
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,900
 People used to eat swans, right? That's a thing. I guess you could eat a swan. Why not?

757
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,120
 I mean, you did anything with the right attitude

758
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,840
 We are one from slurping time motherfucker greetings face fuckers

759
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:32,640
 I'm writing in response to a conversation at scoop fest about bits and how this community attracts people with a fervent love and

760
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,000
 Commitment to silly bits. Yeah

761
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,680
 It's it's one of the best things about our community

762
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:45,200
 One of my favorite things this year was being privy to scoops sharing their personal bits with each other giggedy

763
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:52,180
 So that we could all go home with fresh road tested material that our spouses and loved ones would still not appreciate

764
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,520
 This jogged my my memory of a genius bit

765
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,320
 My high school friend Nicole invented that I think some scoops will find useful in their everyday life

766
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,840
 Here is what she would do

767
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:10,920
 In the middle of class Nicole would tilt her head up crinkle her nose and say mmm. Did someone just microwave popcorn?

768
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:18,580
 Then seconds later everyone sitting around her would start dry heaving and coughing uncontrollably with laughter

769
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:22,400
 While some managed to choke out a faint fuck you

770
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,200
 Let me explain

771
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:30,080
 This is a bit Nicole and her older sister perfected in a prank war as kids

772
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:36,320
 When one of them had a rancid silent, but deadly fart and they wanted to trick the other into smelling

773
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:42,520
 Through many iterations. They found the foulest trick was priming each other from

774
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:50,820
 Microwave popcorn scent as it lowered the victims defenses and when one's olfactory is expecting a sweet buttery scent of microwave

775
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:57,340
 Popcorn the juxtaposition of the actual scent of a putrid ass gas kicks in bad

776
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,400
 There is also a delay

777
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:05,080
 So the victim will have taken a full-throated drag and had their lungs filled with the flatuous

778
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:11,120
 Before their senses could smell the the rocket actually been cooking no

779
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,600
 That's the result of the prank this is

780
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:22,120
 It's a war crime. It's a hell. I hate I hate what I'm listening. That's a hell of a move

781
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:27,080
 I don't this is actually this is worse than what the u.s. Is doing out in the pacific. Oh

782
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:37,760
 Bung rip a break coughing and retching from my classmates Nicole gave and still gives zero fucks as she did this popcorn bit

783
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:44,480
 Every goddamn time she farts and it was truly one of the funniest things to watch once you're in on the gag

784
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,160
 However, she did it to me so fucking bad with this the first time she did it to me

785
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,520
 What I was ten years ago that till this day I went when I walked through an AMC movie theater

786
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,880
 Feel free to use this bit at your own risk PS. I'm curious what other bits scoops might have to share

787
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,220
 And if they could be so good to share them in a fucking scoop mail format

788
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:09,180
 Figgy fucking your olfactory glands. That's slurping chi a motherfucker

789
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:14,920
 That's really funny that that's commitment. I mean that is that is commitment for sure

790
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,520
 That is like Geneva wants to have words with you

791
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:28,360
 That's that's just cruel. I mean just do that once is genius to really commit and do it all the time. That's crazy

792
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,760
 Yeah

793
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,680
 How are you guys on fart humor

794
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:44,960
 Well, I'm very happy with fart humor when it is the the sound of the fart and and the funny like oh

795
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:51,000
 This was this was a fart thing. Yeah. Yeah, this is great as soon as I smell something just rank I

796
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:59,840
 Stop thinking it's funny. So quickly there is there is a my favorite murder animated a letter that somebody wrote into them

797
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:07,480
 About this guy he was working at a post office and he let a fart that was so stank

798
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,220
 That the post office had to be shut down and the fucking bomb squad got called

799
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:17,700
 Because they thought it was some kind of chemical contaminant coming in through the mail

800
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,840
 It is wild

801
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,200
 Wow

802
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,520
 Yeah, I never was like all that stuff was farting

803
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,800
 It feels like in the in the in the vein of like like bag tagging or like drawing

804
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:38,000
 Yes, if someone falls asleep all that all that kind of stuff puts me in a weird place. I don't like it

805
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,640
 I'm with you Jacob. I think the noise is where the funny is the machine. Yeah, make the sounds and all that are great

806
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:50,600
 But like didn't they just have a teacher get arrested for putting fart gas on his students all the time

807
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,120
 What? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

808
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,120
 There's a story about

809
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,760
 to the internet Jacob

810
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:06,900
 When I typed in teacher arrested the autofill was for fart spray. Okay, this was it so share with it

811
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:13,140
 I don't know the exact what what happened, but let's see when it comes to the smell stuff. That's when it starts to get

812
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,760
 criminal a

813
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,080
 32 year old assistant teacher in West Florence High School in South Carolina was arrested for spraying a foul-smelling

814
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:29,440
 Substance through the school's ventilation system his actions which occurred nearly over nearly a month long period

815
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,240
 led to six to six students and over

816
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:43,300
 $55,000 in damages to the school's air conditioning system Lewis face charge of disturbing schools and malicious intent malicious malicious injury to property

817
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,200
 I

818
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,220
 Questioned the quality of that AC system

819
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,720
 Fart spray takes it out

820
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,920
 Yeah, that's not HEPA approved. That's for sure

821
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:03,660
 This was and that have you seen the the the cruel thing that the people do for the people who are in the inflated costumes

822
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,060
 Yes, because you got a little you got you fart into the fart at the vent

823
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,560
 Are you put something at the vent and they're just stuck?

824
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,640
 Can you imagine just fart not somebody's vent and it's just like

825
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:22,580
 People take like a fish bait and just throw it up against the fan

826
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:28,760
 My favorite example of that comes from the Harlan Williams

827
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:35,180
 Rocketman movie. He does it he's connected via a tube to another astronaut

828
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:41,960
 That's a part and there's this whole back and forth where they're stuck in there with the fart. Oh

829
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:50,120
 it's funny when it's on TV and it's a sound and you can't smell it, but I think you're right Jacob when you smell it it's

830
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,640
 Just I just don't know shit. Yeah. This is why I don't hang out in Paul's bathroom

831
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:01,920
 Yeah, just don't want it just don't want it. What were you about to say Matt?

832
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,680
 That I was at a kids Halloween parade

833
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:13,020
 Yesterday where I saw a lot of the idea of seeing these adorable children being assaulted with farts is really just not comforting

834
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,720
 You saw a lot of inflatable costumes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

835
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,320
 So if you yeah, you're gonna get them just hit them with a little fart spray right on the

836
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,580
 They're done. Just do it the old-fashioned way and fart on them

837
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:27,440
 Just go in there and fart on them

838
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,920
 Let's do a little jock vs. Nerd

839
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,520
 I'm on the hunt for balls

840
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:47,840
 The hunt for balls

841
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,680
 Explosion up the stairs. Oh, no, it's happening

842
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:11,360
 We got an old-school jock vs. Nerd coming to us today from King scoop King scoop has sent us a timeline jock vs

843
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,360
 Nerd, I think he sent us another one of these a long time ago. This one also might be from a long time ago

844
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,360
 I didn't see what the date on the email was

845
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,600
 but this is I'm gonna give you an event and then I'm gonna give you two other events and

846
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:28,120
 Then you're gonna tell me which of those happen closer to the primary event. Oh, right. Yeah, these are interesting

847
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:33,920
 So the first one and he made this so I can't see the answers. Okay. I like them too. So I can play it too

848
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,500
 So these are head trippy

849
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:42,240
 Yeah, so the first one the first San Diego comic-con took place. That's the main event

850
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:50,620
 That's the primary event is that closer in time to the Berlin wall being built or the fall of the Berlin wall?

851
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:54,840
 Ooh

852
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,800
 Paul you want to go first on this one you seem like you got a sure some kind of handle

853
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
 Does anybody know when the Berlin wall was built?

854
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,280
 Well, it came down in the 80s so before that I

855
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,760
 Asked when it was built. Yeah, it was built before that

856
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:20,160
 But it's like the 90s or right out. It was not built in the 90s. It got built in like

857
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,500
 In like the 50s, right

858
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,760
 After the war right

859
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,920
 Oh

860
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,240
 Boy, it's gonna be close

861
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:41,360
 Close close close. I guess I'm gonna say it's closer to the building of the wall

862
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,000
 Do you know when the first comic-con was?

863
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,620
 78 I think oh

864
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,520
 Well, then I would also say it's closer to the to the building of the wall

865
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,600
 Matt, what do you think? So I have to get which event is closer to the wall or comic-con

866
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,480
 Yeah, it's comic-con is the is the primary event

867
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:06,520
 Yeah, is that closer to is that closer in time to the Berlin wall being built or the Berlin wall being taken down?

868
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,920
 I'm gonna say Berlin wall taken down

869
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,720
 All right, so Paul and I both think built Matt thinks

870
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,840
 taken down

871
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,940
 It is the Berlin wall being built right

872
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,860
 Comic-con first done in 1970 of the world was built in 61

873
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:28,000
 So off on that one came down in 89

874
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,640
 Okay

875
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,760
 Let's see we got the first Major League Baseball World Series took place

876
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:42,840
 Is that closer to Joseph Stalin coming to power or Coca-Cola is first sold in bottles?

877
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:53,600
 I'll go first on this one. I think this is gonna be closer to the Coca-Cola. What what's the main event again?

878
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,400
 Major League Baseball first World Series, okay

879
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,360
 World Series Stalin or coke

880
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,240
 Yeah

881
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,240
 I'm going world. I'm going

882
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,400
 coke cola the stories of like I

883
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,600
 Think it was like shoeless Joe Jax in order for being like an early investor in coke

884
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
 So I'm gonna go with coke as well

885
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:22,480
 Really? Okay. I feel like coke is super old. And so is the World Series. I'll just but this isn't coke

886
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:28,540
 This is bottles. This is bottled coke. I'll go contrary and I'll say Stalin. All right, let's see

887
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:32,180
 It is coca-cola

888
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,180
 World Series 1903

889
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,720
 Stalin 1924 Coca-Cola first bottled

890
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:45,440
 1894. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's it. Oh, that's the other bottling. I know. Okay, that's that

891
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,520
 bottling thing I

892
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,640
 Think that's the non carbonated

893
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,740
 Bottling of coca-cola and you had to you had to have the thing to add

894
01:14:55,740 --> 01:15:00,360
 Into yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you had to add the seltzer water in maybe okay

895
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,280
 I

896
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:07,240
 Think I might be I might be off on those dates. I should know this my granddad worked for him

897
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:13,920
 the first disco world novel by Terry Pratchett was published disk is that closer to

898
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,020
 That does say disc world

899
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:24,240
 No, it's a what yes also I have disco on the mind

900
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,120
 Yeah, so anyway disc world novel was published

901
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:33,080
 Is that closer to Israel becoming an independent Jewish state or Donald Trump becoming president?

902
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,760
 I

903
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,520
 have I

904
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,800
 Don't have a guess on this really at all. I know that Terry Pratchett is a fairly modern

905
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,940
 Author so I'll say Trump disc world was in the 80s. Oh

906
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,880
 Okay, I believe

907
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,920
 Late 70s early 80s

908
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:10,280
 I'll go with Israel. Yeah, of course is about Israel

909
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,180
 Matt I think it's also about Israel. Let's see

910
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:22,680
 Point for Jacob Donald Trump up this world published in 83 right on that Paul

911
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:30,500
 Israel becomes an independent Jewish state in 1948 and Donald Trump becomes president and 2016. Okay, so there you go. Okay

912
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:37,400
 The first time a player Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a basketball game

913
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:43,560
 Is that closer to Orson Welles war of the world's being broadcast or Facebook's founding?

914
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:55,560
 Chamberlain scores a hundred points with the still that's the 70s the Big Dipper. Yep

915
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:03,000
 No, three-point line just scored a hundred points two points at a time that thing was in the 50s

916
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,160
 the world of worlds, yep

917
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,720
 and

918
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,620
 This was found in late 90s, I think Facebook was like, yeah

919
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:22,920
 Something like that. Yeah, it had to been like yeah very late 90s like 98 or something 97

920
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,160
 I'm gonna go with Facebook. I think the world of worlds is older than that

921
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,520
 I'll go with war of the worlds. Oh

922
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,240
 You put me in a predicament

923
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,000
 I'll go

924
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,400

925
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,600

 War of the world's Paul gets a point. We go. Yeah back on the board

927
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:50,280
 1960 sorry

928
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:56,520
 War of the world's is that the hundred-point score from wilt is in the 60s. It's 62 not in the 70s

929
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,880
 We were off on that. I also thought that was in the 70s

930
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,060
 War of the world's is 38 Facebook 38 2004

931
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,880
 so

932
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,920
 Basically every single date we said about anything in that question was all wrong

933
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:15,860
 Yeah, we were just wrong about every well and that and that tracks that I would get it right for not having the right math

934
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:20,960
 First ever video game tennis for two was created

935
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:27,160
 Is that closer to the USSR launching Sputnik or the movie Jaws opening in theaters?

936
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,880
 Tennis for two is the video game. Is that closer to Sputnik or Jaws?

937
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:40,680
 Sputnik was 60s Jaws was what 78?

938
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,600
 Something like that

939
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:53,280

 Sputnik. Oh it is Sputnik. Yay tennis for two 1958

 Okay, and then Jaws opened in 75. So Sputnik was really close. Yeah

949
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:38,640
 Rocky Marciano retired having gone undefeated in 49 boxing matches

950
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:46,920
 Is that closer in time to computer game space invaders being released or the GI bill is signed providing financial aid to veterans?

951
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:55,640
 Rocky Marciano closer to space invaders or the GI bill
