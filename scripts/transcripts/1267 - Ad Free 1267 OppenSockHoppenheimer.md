**[0:01:37]** I don't know why

**[0:01:39]** It's just been the last five days the lefty. So we have a different disease entirely. Absolutely

**[0:01:44]** Absolutely different. It's be careful fellas. It's spreading completely different shit. I don't know

**[0:01:49]** It's just you know, I think it's possibly the change in the weather combined with the fact that I

**[0:01:55]** Worked my ass off three days straight. I don't know

**[0:01:59]** Who knows whatever it's you know, what's fucked up, but good it gets better the more I'm up and on it

**[0:02:05]** So I guess that's weird. It's when I sit down that it starts to get really bad. Oh, it's like tightening up

**[0:02:11]** Yeah, I don't know so I'm having to stretch a lot more and all that kind of thing which eventually is good

**[0:02:16]** I do need to do more stretching and all that kind of thing

**[0:02:19]** What's happening with your knee Matt? I?

**[0:02:24]** Just heard it playing in the soccer game with adults versus kids soccer game. Oh smart. Oh, yeah smart play

**[0:02:32]** Okay. Oh, hold on one second guys. I gotta hit this button

**[0:02:41]** Because my knee hurts too

**[0:02:45]** And what I'm finding is that I am a restless sleeper. Oh

**[0:02:51]** I tossed in turn so what happens is I

**[0:02:55]** Feel better and then I wake up and my knee hurts the next day because I've you've been jerking around leg around all

**[0:03:01]** When I like okay, so I worked yesterday early in the morning

**[0:03:06]** You know had a full day and stayed up past my normal bedtime, which I was I had three days in a row

**[0:03:12]** So I was getting to bed at like five o'clock

**[0:03:14]** So I wouldn't play I wouldn't play any games and sick as a dog

**[0:03:18]** So I was trying to take care of her a little bit and not get sick myself and so far so good

**[0:03:24]** Yeah, I got a little stuffy head today, but not too bad, but

**[0:03:30]** When I stay up late like I did last night past my normal bedtime my

**[0:03:37]** Legs start to get real

**[0:03:40]** antsy

**[0:03:41]** And they start they start to hurt and they get jittery

**[0:03:44]** And I have to like shake my leg and twist my leg all evening

**[0:03:48]** It's like go to bed go to bed go to bed. Okay fine

**[0:03:52]** But yeah, I was up pretty late. I mean I wasn't up that late. I was like 930, but

**[0:03:58]** Well, I

**[0:04:00]** Forgot that I'm here. I'm at sea. I'm in the ocean. Yes. I'm actually actually off-shore some rando

**[0:04:07]** island at princess zones

**[0:04:12]** But I've seen it and I

**[0:04:16]** Forgot to pack a knee brace because I found it was helping my knees

**[0:04:19]** I was going to sleep with a knee brace, which doesn't help me sleep better

**[0:04:22]** It just helps my knee feel better the next day. I sleep worse. I sleep more restlessly wearing a knee brace

**[0:04:28]** Okay, right because I wake up. Oh, it's got me

**[0:04:34]** Something's grabbing my knee. Oh shit. I'm watching alien Earth. I assume some alien has gripped my knee

**[0:04:48]** They do

**[0:04:49]** By the way, I hate the modern TV show where like you you kind of like slow burn

**[0:04:55]** Middle episodes to like to like peak almost peak boredom and then they and then they really stick the landing on the final

**[0:05:00]** Two and a half episodes and you're like, yeah, all right

**[0:05:04]** You did pick it up and I it's like I'd rather watch the show that I just watched at the end the whole time

**[0:05:09]** Are they I hate it too and what makes me crazy is in our day. We had 24 25

**[0:05:19]** Now they can't even get fucking eight. Yeah

**[0:05:23]** Well, yeah, I think we look back at the quality of those 24 episodes. We're not gonna be like nail them

**[0:05:28]** I think yeah, I think you'd be surprised. I think you'd be surprised

**[0:05:34]** Well, here's the thing here's not nailed them. Take a look take a pause recording. Let's all go watch Hill Street Blues

**[0:05:40]** And let's come back

**[0:05:43]** Let's all go watch in the heat of the night. I mean my my base dog is

**[0:05:49]** We're gonna sit down everybody and all watch a different world. Let's do it

**[0:05:54]** I just think they're trying to get rid of more episodes

**[0:05:57]** Where I want to agree with you

**[0:06:01]** It's just money. We just we're spending movie money on television now

**[0:06:05]** And so you can't afford to make more than eight episodes, right?

**[0:06:09]** but

**[0:06:11]** Compelling drama that can resolve in an hour. That's where you're talking about that's what you're talking about Paul is

**[0:06:18]** These episodes are these these modern TV shows are secretly just super long movies. Yeah, which is gross, you know

**[0:06:23]** Yeah, they're a lot of movies. They have some

**[0:06:26]** They have some kind of arc

**[0:06:28]** Yeah

**[0:06:30]** But they

**[0:06:31]** They're slow burning the shit. Well, that's the thing like Trek is sort of

**[0:06:38]** Responsible for all this too because it was season three where they did

**[0:06:44]** You know best of both worlds

**[0:06:45]** That was the first true

**[0:06:49]** Season to season cliffhanger that had ever been attempted in syndication

**[0:06:54]** Oh, I see it was it was the end of a season and then the season break. Yes

**[0:06:59]** Gotcha, so half of the season half of the cliffhanger was at the end of the season

**[0:07:03]** then you had to wait four months five months before the next one started up again and

**[0:07:09]** you know

**[0:07:11]** Tantalizing but it was the one where Patrick Stewart became the other thing that the when he became a cutis. Yes

**[0:07:17]** That is are the what's the Borg that's the Borg that became the cutis of Borg

**[0:07:22]** Yeah, and that is that was the model that they then went forward with from then on out with all

**[0:07:28]** The Trek series all the Trek series had season cliffhangers. I

**[0:07:34]** Still remember as a kid not knowing how like I didn't necessarily like we didn't get like TV guide to the house or anything, right?

**[0:07:40]** And different strokes. Yeah, they snuck under the set of Knight Rider. I remember that

**[0:07:46]** They were hiding behind he was with that kid from Terminator

**[0:07:50]** Not the main kid from Terminator the other redhead kid from Terminator

**[0:07:54]** Well, I think was also on salute your shorts. Yeah. Yeah, the little punk that was him and and

**[0:07:59]** Arnold hid what happened they hid and they almost got killed

**[0:08:03]** They hid the hit in the set and it's that was gonna be exploded, right? Yeah. Yeah, and everybody goes

**[0:08:08]** The audience goes well and I was like all summer being like I have to remember to watch the first

**[0:08:15]** comes back around

**[0:08:16]** What happened?

**[0:08:19]** Yeah, he was wondering whether

**[0:08:23]** Dead and explosion like they start the series like so sorry every character is dead. They all do well

**[0:08:29]** It wasn't every character. It was just Arnold dead space

**[0:08:32]** The cast on to the set of a James Cameron movie James Cameron murdered them

**[0:08:38]** Was gonna happen in terms of that like Arnold's death. Yeah, I don't

**[0:08:45]** In a set explosion in the Simpsons in the first season

**[0:08:49]** A child was killed. There's that classic episode in the first season Simpsons are all classics

**[0:08:54]** But that one where Homer finally goes to try sushi and

**[0:08:59]** He fucking loves it and then he decides he wants to go for the forbidden sushi the Fugu

**[0:09:05]** Which is the blowfish which if not prepared properly can be poisonous and deadly

**[0:09:11]** And yes, so the whole premise was will Homer die

**[0:09:16]** Eating this poison sushi and the commercials that you didn't get TV guide

**[0:09:21]** I got TV guide and the TV guide commercial was a little blurb a little picture

**[0:09:26]** With Bart coming up to going. Yeah, right like they're gonna kill the main character of a

**[0:09:33]** Show in the first season and you know

**[0:09:37]** So it really was you know, it was before Game of Thrones. They were do that back then

**[0:09:42]** They were always on their ear. They were always putting stuff in a thing. What then I also saw

**[0:09:48]** Damn, I just saw a tick to talk to me. So say I'm not gonna talk about it. Anyway, I

**[0:09:54]** Wanted to say before we go any further. I

**[0:09:57]** Wanted to say thank you to Matt and Jacob because

**[0:10:00]** Guys, I don't know if you know, but they always come through when it's my birthday and sure enough here

**[0:10:06]** We are recording on my birthday

**[0:10:08]** And they did it. They gave me permission to use my sound box throughout this episode

**[0:10:16]** Happy birthday, buddy. There we go. So that's what you have to look forward to

**[0:10:21]** Wait, is zoom is zoom cutting off the

**[0:10:25]** The fart box it didn't let the sound go through. Let's see if I can get one to go through the recording will hear it, but we won't

**[0:10:36]** Zoom as a thing where it cuts out like weird weird weird noises of it's part of it's part of it's

**[0:10:41]** Noise canceling things that you'll meet here. What a bunch of shit

**[0:10:48]** Correct that it is going into the

**[0:10:52]** Okay, that's great. Well, so it'll be really funny

**[0:10:56]** That it will you know

**[0:10:59]** It'll come up only in the episode

**[0:11:01]** So that'll be a whole surprise for later. Yeah, that's right. So yeah, but a couple of people said it

**[0:11:07]** I already had it pulled up to I'm sorry Paul

**[0:11:11]** Star Trek didn't do it first. Who did it first?

**[0:11:14]** Dallas who shot J. R. Oh, I guess you're right. Yeah, ten years ten years earlier Dallas was 1980

**[0:11:21]** Star Trek did it in 1990

**[0:11:24]** Yeah, yeah, so they did the the season great who shot J. R

**[0:11:29]** I'm sorry Paul. You're precious Star Trek didn't do it first. Hey, look look I'm I am I

**[0:11:36]** Have no problem giving Brandon Braga less credit fuck that guy

**[0:11:41]** Dog good he can eat dig what a turd he's at Brandon Braga's a piece of shit

**[0:11:53]** Oh, man now my my computer's asking me if I'm playing music. No, I'm not playing music. You dumb thing. I

**[0:11:59]** Mean I played a tiny little piece of music. Well, now I can't really do it. It's not fun if I nobody can hear it

**[0:12:05]** Anyway, oh, I got a message for so

**[0:12:10]** Well, not only did I injure my knee playing soccer

**[0:12:13]** But we decided this year man. We did a whole

**[0:12:18]** Is it Nick Newman

**[0:12:20]** Totally influenced by whole family about Thanksgiving. It's basically this is the unit because he did our kids hate

**[0:12:26]** Thanksgiving food. Oh

**[0:12:29]** Would you do that's right? Your kids do not care for Thanksgiving food. They never have they do not they do not and

**[0:12:37]** Sarah's, you know, basically a vegan. Mm-hmm

**[0:12:40]** And so I rest that there's only one person the household that was looking forward to Thanksgiving

**[0:12:44]** It was me and I was like, well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna, you know, be a fatty dick

**[0:12:49]** And so we blew it off I've never done it before my life we blew off Thanksgiving. Oh

**[0:13:01]** I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. Feel so weird. I feel icky about it. No, no, no, what'd you have?

**[0:13:09]** Just normal. So here's what we did. We rallied a

**[0:13:13]** Kind of like friends friends with kids kickball game, okay?

**[0:13:19]** And

**[0:13:21]** We brought turkey and roast beef deli slices and croissants and right and some fixings

**[0:13:26]** Some hummus of penis peanut. I said Pia penis. I said penis. Okay, so we did we did our we did our new tradition of

**[0:13:35]** Dipping our penis and in hummus

**[0:13:37]** Good

**[0:13:40]** Mind the pine nuts and

**[0:13:44]** Uh, we have like a basic like half ass picnic

**[0:13:49]** Rich Cooper the jet says that's not a new tradition. You know what's weird matt

**[0:13:53]** You know what's strange about that tradition is I personally have never had anyone

**[0:13:59]** I've never paid anyone to penis on me before

**[0:14:01]** Uh

**[0:14:07]** Nobody's buying that

**[0:14:09]** You never paid a garbanzo to be

**[0:14:15]** They're paying a garbanzo to bean on me. Oh shit

**[0:14:20]** There's no evidence that built that built could never garbanzo'd on trump's bean. That's right. No, no

**[0:14:26]** But holy shit

**[0:14:30]** So then so we're playing kickball and both sarah and I

**[0:14:35]** Popped the hamstring playing kickball. Oh, damn it. That's awful

**[0:14:41]** I saw sarah that night and she was like this is terrible. This is the worst thing

**[0:14:47]** Sarah really

**[0:14:48]** Sarah really poppy she was going to run for a ball and you know like like it's like you like music professional dreams

**[0:14:53]** Whether they're running and they just stop and you go

**[0:14:55]** Yeah, like sarah's sarah's running and all of a sudden it was like nope

**[0:14:58]** And I was like, oh god like I was the one running. I could have ran

**[0:15:03]** To the next base and I stopped like oh god and then the very next play

**[0:15:08]** I popped my hamstring running from second to third. Oh god. So, uh, I just

**[0:15:12]** It's my brain subconsciously cannot let sarah have any more attention that she already gets good. I have to bear

**[0:15:18]** We have to do it. Well, we had we had inadvertently

**[0:15:22]** a similar situation at my home

**[0:15:25]** because

**[0:15:26]** uh

**[0:15:27]** the day before Thanksgiving and got terribly sick like

**[0:15:32]** Knocked down drag out sick still had to go to work still worked and almost dying

**[0:15:39]** And so I was like, okay. I better make at least some kind of backup plan

**[0:15:44]** So on the way home. I bought warm up mashed potatoes and mac and cheese

**[0:15:48]** So at least we'd have something that resembled a Thanksgiving day. Okay, okay

**[0:15:53]** And got home and sure enough. She was just out of it. We were done. We didn't get to go down to the the in-laws

**[0:16:00]** But we absolutely had

**[0:16:02]** chicken nuggets mashed potatoes cottage cheese

**[0:16:06]** That was that was Thanksgiving dinner

**[0:16:09]** That was it

**[0:16:11]** Wait, where's the cottage cheese is the cottage cheese of its own dishes to go on top

**[0:16:15]** I put mashed I put cottage cheese on the mashed potatoes. I can't I love that. That's my favorite

**[0:16:19]** Good lord. I this has come up before and I I still don't understand it. I talk about it all the time

**[0:16:49]** Uh

**[0:16:50]** I let's see nick see nick newman top baked potatoes with cottage cheese. I think it's a southern thing

**[0:16:55]** I think there's some kind of weird

**[0:16:59]** You and nick will not represent the entire

**[0:17:02]** No, okay, okay, but oh i'm say katucky fine. I'll say katucky because I my mom

**[0:17:10]** My mom used to make lasagna using cottage cheese instead of ricotta

**[0:17:15]** So I that's I prefer cottage cheese and lasagna to ricotta

**[0:17:20]** Any day of the week. Yeah

**[0:17:22]** But I just really love a little cottage cheese on my mashed potatoes

**[0:17:26]** According to the google. It's not a uh, it's not a southern thing or

**[0:17:30]** It doesn't have a particular area of origin

**[0:17:33]** It is uh touted though as a a nice higher protein version and a little healthier version of mashed potatoes

**[0:17:39]** If you're not doing like all the yeah, if you're not doing like the

**[0:17:42]** Loaded mash sour creams and bakings and all that now. I just do a little just a little cottage cheese

**[0:17:48]** Just a dab of potatoes and some cottage cheese in there little salt and pepper. Yeah, sure

**[0:17:53]** Yes, little salt and pepper some kind of sure every doctor be proud

**[0:17:57]** Proud of you switching the cottage cheese. Oh, I mean, it's the healthy lifestyle choice of the generation as you can tell

**[0:18:03]** It's done wonders for me

**[0:18:05]** It's really moved the needle

**[0:18:07]** I mean it got you to this birthday. It did. I mean, hey, I made it to 51

**[0:18:11]** Better than a lot of people do

**[0:18:13]** I bet it's better than half the population does

**[0:18:17]** So there you go

**[0:18:19]** RFK approved. Don't be saying that lemur creamer lemur creamer in in in the chat

**[0:18:23]** Well, it's an event that took out all those horrible dyes of the cottage cheese

**[0:18:27]** Turned out that cottage cheese is actually

**[0:18:32]** When it's with the mashed potato

**[0:18:36]** Brings out the body

**[0:18:40]** Oh

**[0:18:40]** Paul you RFK we can't hear you, but I know it'll be on the broadcast

**[0:18:48]** I killed my wife. I drove into suicide and I write horrible fuck poetry

**[0:18:56]** He's so nasty. We're not nasty. He wrote he's so nasty

**[0:19:00]** I would pay

**[0:19:04]** $14.99 for a book of RFK's poetry. Oh god

**[0:19:10]** Don't say that he'll publish it. He'll do it. He'll he don't give a fuck

**[0:19:15]** Only if it's an audio

**[0:19:18]** He does sound a little like

**[0:19:19]** Yes, the kickball we all ate sandwiches and hummus and uh

**[0:19:24]** It went home and I had we had leftover pizzas from the day before because we had all the a bunch of kids over

**[0:19:29]** if we all saw wicked

**[0:19:30]** okay, and

**[0:19:32]** So it was so it was leftover pizza was the other Thanksgiving course that we had and then uh,

**[0:19:38]** And it was off to mac kings for dessert

**[0:19:40]** That's pretty great

**[0:19:41]** That sounds like a really nice day

**[0:19:44]** Uh, it was super fun. It was it was it was really nice not to take Thanksgiving that seriously

**[0:19:48]** And it was like gosh

**[0:19:50]** I really have to figure this out

**[0:19:52]** It's a really good idea

**[0:19:54]** To not stress out of the whole Thanksgiving

**[0:19:56]** Um

**[0:19:59]** I performed at in the max Thanksgiving variety show nice good

**[0:20:07]** Um

**[0:20:08]** He asked bread sure would and I since paul couldn't make it paul was invited. Um

**[0:20:14]** To do a some kind of improv song bit. Oh fun

**[0:20:18]** And then I called spedoni and spedoni was available. So we had spedoni there beautiful

**[0:20:25]** And then

**[0:20:27]** After arranging all that I got a text from brad saying you got a minute and I was like, oh, no

**[0:20:31]** He's gonna fail. Uh-huh, and then I I call him and it is not him bailing. He's like, hey, I said a wild idea

**[0:20:39]** He's like, what if all right, what if

**[0:20:42]** what if we do uh, uh do it all in shakespeare

**[0:20:47]** And uh, you do magic tricks, but I play like your hype man like your producer

**[0:20:51]** And I'm just blown away by all the magic we're doing and I just narrate everyone's thoughts

**[0:20:55]** I like this

**[0:20:59]** and I said, um

**[0:21:02]** The one thing that mac king's show has is magic. Yeah

**[0:21:09]** And arguably lousy with it

**[0:21:12]** and

**[0:21:14]** You know, we were specific guys to do music. Yeah, it goes. All right. Why don't we do it as a musical?

**[0:21:20]** Oh

**[0:21:21]** Yes, and motherfucker

**[0:21:26]** So we did uh

**[0:21:30]** Uh, we we did what we call the uh, the prom Shakespeare repertory presents much to do about magic the musical great

**[0:21:40]** Funny that's cool

**[0:21:44]** Uh, it was so well that some people thought it was written which is always the best

**[0:21:50]** Exactly

**[0:21:52]** And brad and I want to do it again beautiful

**[0:21:54]** That we want to find a way to like we we were not satisfied with just the the ten minute hunk that we did

**[0:22:00]** We want to do it again. This is the trick, right? Like we're finding these new ways to expand on improv like, uh

**[0:22:06]** Collin mockery is doing

**[0:22:09]** the hypnoprov

**[0:22:11]** Yeah, brad works with collin a lot, so

**[0:22:15]** I imagine he's seeing the bold new adventures that can be like what else can we use improv to mine

**[0:22:23]** Well

**[0:22:25]** Yes

**[0:22:26]** so

**[0:22:26]** brad and collin perform

**[0:22:29]** Uh, i've been performed together for 15 something years or more than that maybe okay

**[0:22:35]** So so anytime you see hip-prov performing that's collin not performing with with brad

**[0:22:41]** Ah

**[0:22:43]** It's just I think that's the the most uh delicate way I can say got it. Yeah. Yeah fair fair

**[0:22:51]** So yes, collin has discovered that trying to sell the hip hip-prov thing they tried it in vegas

**[0:22:57]** It was too soon. It was a mistake and there's also bad timing. Yeah, um and and uh did not

**[0:23:03]** Did not get a lot of positive show reports from that hey, man

**[0:23:06]** Experience, where did they do that? Muppet improv didn't hardly fucking work in vegas. No, it's it's fucking tough

**[0:23:13]** Muppet didn't work in vegas for a different set of reasons. Oh fine, but it's still it's still

**[0:23:18]** Improv with awesome shit not working. So yeah, there's the crazy cocaine habit of all those puppets that really did it in

**[0:23:25]** That's that they really do

**[0:23:28]** Good lord those felt line straws. They are just

**[0:23:32]** hoovering it

**[0:23:38]** They are Paul they are

**[0:23:40]** I'll tell you who else is sucking up a lot of cocaine into their felt lined noses and that is the following sponsor

**[0:23:47]** Which I have in my hand right here. Oh

**[0:23:51]** There we go. Sorry. I've heard do more than I usually have to um

**[0:23:55]** This is paul's emergency toilet paper socks paul's emergency toilet paper socks from a scoop of montecristo

**[0:24:02]** Uh this year that was this year

**[0:24:08]** We've all had the horrible embarrassment of

**[0:24:11]** having to shit

**[0:24:14]** In a place

**[0:24:15]** Without a bathroom

**[0:24:20]** When it happens

**[0:24:21]** Not if

**[0:24:23]** but when

**[0:24:25]** Will you be ready for the challenge?

**[0:24:28]** Of the necessary ass wipery

**[0:24:32]** Because that's the real challenge of going to the bathroom without a bathroom the cleanup

**[0:24:41]** introducing

**[0:24:42]** paul's emergency ass wipe socks

**[0:24:46]** Paul's emergency ass wipe socks are equipped with a double layer

**[0:24:51]** one for absorbency

**[0:24:53]** and one

**[0:24:54]** to be discarded

**[0:24:56]** and then used again

**[0:24:58]** for absorbency

**[0:25:00]** That was two number ones. There are two number ones

**[0:25:04]** Yeah, but one of them's four number two when you have the paul's emergency shit socks on

**[0:25:09]** You technically are wearing four socks

**[0:25:13]** The first outer layer is the more absorbent layer

**[0:25:17]** And that is the one to be used

**[0:25:19]** upon first blush if you will

**[0:25:21]** getting the most

**[0:25:24]** liquid

**[0:25:25]** Out of the system

**[0:25:28]** The second is less absorbent but no less important

**[0:25:34]** But we advise you go ahead and employ both socks

**[0:25:39]** Use the second sock's first layer of absorbency

**[0:25:44]** To make sure that the rectal area is clear of all juices

**[0:25:49]** Then

**[0:25:50]** With the third sock, which is the first sock second layer

**[0:25:55]** Go ahead and do what we call the check it tab

**[0:26:01]** Tab it up there

**[0:26:02]** Take it back out and check it

**[0:26:05]** Where are we standing folks?

**[0:26:07]** Did we get everything?

**[0:26:08]** If we didn't

**[0:26:10]** Invert the third sock, which is the second sock of the first sock

**[0:26:15]** I'm sorry paul, I can't believe the war is happening

**[0:26:20]** Finally

**[0:26:22]** After the check

**[0:26:24]** You go ahead

**[0:26:26]** And you use the fourth sock, which is the second sock of the second sock

**[0:26:31]** That one of course

**[0:26:33]** Is rounded up

**[0:26:35]** And tucked

**[0:26:36]** As a muffler

**[0:26:37]** To prevent any further seepage

**[0:26:40]** Interhase goops and check out

**[0:26:42]** It just makes too much sense

**[0:26:45]** We gotta figure out the zoom thing because everyone's turned off their cameras and so we can't see if anyone's laughing

**[0:26:54]** I saw a few or maybe everyone turned off their camera just to vomit I saw a few I saw a few laughs. I saw a few laughs

**[0:27:05]** Just

**[0:27:05]** Just in time for christmas

**[0:27:08]** Just in time for christmas

**[0:27:10]** You can hang them by your you can hang them by the fireplace, you know, uh, I mean you gotta drive out somehow. Yeah

**[0:27:18]** Have you been if you guys been watching this show physical asia on netflix

**[0:27:28]** Is that the one with the really strange?

**[0:27:31]** uh, japanese

**[0:27:33]** Uh, olivia newton john impersonator

**[0:27:38]** Yes, yes, that's that's the show that i'm alluding to right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the japanese olivia newton john impersonator physical asia

**[0:27:47]** Yeah, that was it was really odd, but I mean, you know, yeah, let's get physical

**[0:27:53]** in asia

**[0:27:55]** Oh, that's so much better than the the japanese person singing physical that I thought you were about to do

**[0:28:00]** I didn't do that. That was bad. I know you did

**[0:28:04]** Uh, they so it's it's a uh, it's a crazy reality competition show

**[0:28:10]** Where they do, uh, these insane like physical tasks and everything and it's different, uh, asian countries

**[0:28:16]** Uh, participating uh competing against each other also for some reason australia

**[0:28:21]** So it's like all these asian countries because olivian john and australia because of olivian newton john, of course

**[0:28:29]** So i'm watching it last night

**[0:28:32]** And they they do it's all uh overdubbed all of the language is overdubbed

**[0:28:36]** Which is kind of neat, uh, just as a side note all of the teams competing against each other

**[0:28:41]** Uh in the overdubbing watching watching the show it just sounds like they're all speaking english to each other

**[0:28:46]** Which of course they are not they're all speaking their native languages to each other

**[0:28:49]** Which means nobody else can understand them in the competition

**[0:28:53]** So they can just work together and talk to each other in their native language and the other team can't understand their planning

**[0:28:59]** And it's it's really kind of a neat twist

**[0:29:02]** But the thing i want to talk about was the overdubbing because they do all of these crazy physical things where they're like grunting and yelling and everything while they're

**[0:29:11]** While they're doing it and they overdub all the grunting and yelling

**[0:29:15]** Oh, that makes no sense

**[0:29:18]** It's so goddamn funny that makes no sense

**[0:29:22]** That's really strange. It is the best thing to watch once you realize that that's what they're doing and like

**[0:29:28]** Oh, right. That's not the uh, that's the same overdubbed voice that is now yelling

**[0:29:33]** Which is not what that person actually sounds like

**[0:29:37]** Yeah

**[0:29:38]** It's so good

**[0:29:40]** It's so good

**[0:29:41]** What are some of the physical challenges they have to do?

**[0:29:43]** They do shit like

**[0:29:45]** I mean, it's it's really insane stuff

**[0:29:49]** The the first one they do is like a king of the mountain type thing

**[0:29:53]** Where they have these these each team is six members and they're all like

**[0:29:58]** MMA fighters and uh wrestlers

**[0:30:02]** Uh track stars. It's it's quite a few former olympians

**[0:30:06]** Uh all this stuff. I mean it's it's the battle of the network stars

**[0:30:10]** Kind of but in like a hard core way. I mean it's it's a ball of the network stars was hardcore

**[0:30:17]** I'm telling you paul

**[0:30:22]** Meatloaf could not have gotten through the first leg of the first competition on this show

**[0:30:26]** He would have died in support

**[0:30:29]** I was wondering we're going to present a vigorous defense for battle of the network stars

**[0:30:33]** I will I will

**[0:30:35]** It's paul's birthday matt

**[0:30:36]** Of course, we're going to present a vigorous defense of battle of the network stars

**[0:30:41]** You know, I also saw jacob. I don't know if you're aware of this new show that they're doing

**[0:30:45]** They've gone in and they're doing this whole retelling

**[0:30:49]** Of the guys who came up with the atom bomb

**[0:30:54]** Uh, but it's set back in the in the 50s

**[0:30:57]** So it's like it's like a future backwards

**[0:30:59]** So it's like it's all it's the it's the the the scientists that made the atom bomb, but they're all

**[0:31:05]** Uh high schoolers in the 50s

**[0:31:08]** Right, okay, so it's up up and hop up and sop up and sock hoppinheimer is what it's called

**[0:31:15]** Uh

**[0:31:17]** Sock hoppinheimer

**[0:31:19]** If you can't say the title of the show on the first three tries the title is too complicated

**[0:31:24]** Up and sock hoppinheimer. I said it there

**[0:31:26]** Up and sock hoppinheimer and it's also starring

**[0:31:32]** olivia newtron john

**[0:31:35]** It all comes together that's how it works. Yeah

**[0:31:40]** Uh

**[0:31:41]** The show was a bomb. I'm assuming it's that's pluto tv and it's pluto tv. It's a pluto original

**[0:31:47]** Good call man. Good call pluto original

**[0:31:51]** Oh

**[0:31:53]** There I said it again

**[0:31:59]** Say up and sock hoppinheimer five times fast. Good luck. No, I'm not trying to watch pluto tv

**[0:32:08]** I

**[0:32:08]** No, they do these insane challenges

**[0:32:10]** Like they they do stuff that if the three of us tried to do

**[0:32:14]** Oh, god single one of these games we would die. Oh, I can't play kickball

**[0:32:19]** Oh, the first thing I heard about on thursday night was how injured you and sarah were

**[0:32:28]** And

**[0:32:29]** I see sarah and sarah's like oh matt and I are so hurt and keeps watching these

**[0:32:36]** These tick tocks with these physical challenges. Have you seen some of these where the couples do these extreme physical moves?

**[0:32:43]** With each other they do like these very gymnastic

**[0:32:46]** They'll see a gymnastic move and then they they're like, okay

**[0:32:48]** We can we can do that, you know, and they're they're in there like a little home gym and they're trying to do it

**[0:32:53]** And sometimes they fuck it up and some of them. Well

**[0:32:56]** over Thanksgiving

**[0:32:57]** She found this one where these guys are doing a new tradition right after the Thanksgiving meal the men

**[0:33:04]** Grab the their wives and hoist them on their shoulders and run a race

**[0:33:11]** And and it's the beats of strength. Yeah, and was laughing her ass off

**[0:33:15]** And I was like, I could do it. Let's do it. She's like, no, no, you couldn't I said I could do it

**[0:33:20]** Come on. I'm picking up. Let's go and I can't try to pick her up

**[0:33:23]** And she wouldn't she wouldn't work with me at all which is probably trying to convince and to let him pick her up

**[0:33:30]** Is the video that we all need to see she wouldn't do it. She would not do it

**[0:33:33]** She's like, no, no, no, I was like, I can't do it by myself

**[0:33:35]** You gotta give me a little jump so I can you know get it going here

**[0:33:39]** But she would not she would not commit to the bit but to be fair

**[0:33:43]** She was also coughing up a fit because she was still uh very very sick, but uh, I don't get picked up like that

**[0:33:49]** That's right. She doesn't get picked up like that and she didn't get picked up like that because I didn't do it

**[0:33:53]** But she was she was ridiculous

**[0:33:56]** I could have done it, but uh, yeah, I see all these things

**[0:34:00]** Jacob, did you ever see the the japanese one with the wall and the shapes?

**[0:34:06]** The wall and the shapes. Yeah

**[0:34:09]** So did I see a television show made in japan that had a wall and some shapes is your question

**[0:34:18]** Yeah, so what happens is

**[0:34:21]** Yes, good job. You're standing. You're standing. Yes. I saw shogun paul. You're standing in this you're standing in this

**[0:34:27]** hallway, no wait paul before you go on

**[0:34:30]** I'm trying to think of a show that doesn't have a wall and shapes

**[0:34:33]** any of them

**[0:34:36]** What happened is the outdoors set shows like the bear grill site things where he's surviving in the wilderness

**[0:34:41]** I guess I don't have no walls. There's plenty of shapes though. They have shapes, but no walls

**[0:34:47]** The the wall has a shape cut out of it of a silhouette

**[0:34:53]** Uh-huh, right a person's physical silhouette. Okay in some sort of stance

**[0:35:01]** Oh, and the wall. I think I have seen this actually the wall moves towards you

**[0:35:05]** Yep, and you must assume the stance to wily coyote style

**[0:35:10]** Fit through the silhouette as it you have to pass through the wall or it smacks you

**[0:35:15]** Yes, you have to it's called hole in the wall. There you go, buddy's on it. It's called hole in the wall

**[0:35:21]** And so I thought it was called any port in the storm

**[0:35:25]** Any port in the storm

**[0:35:27]** It depends on what region you're watching it in some of them is called any port in the storm

**[0:35:31]** Some are called hole in a wall

**[0:35:33]** I've watched every episode of any port in the storm

**[0:35:37]** So that's what happens and the wall keeps going up and then either you get through it or you get smushed

**[0:35:42]** They're gonna do a two person version of that paul. Have you seen that? No, what is it called death in the doorway?

**[0:35:47]** Oh, it's a gentleman's game

**[0:35:52]** Any port in the storm also has a lot of smushing as well

**[0:35:55]** A lot of smushing

**[0:35:57]** A lot of smushing

**[0:36:02]** There was the cocaine addicted muppets

**[0:38:50]** So they were they were around

**[0:38:52]** We had a ton of people

**[0:38:53]** It was great though several people even commented on it

**[0:38:56]** We had no stress the whole cooking of the of the meal and everything

**[0:39:00]** We were just walking around having a nice time. That's how you do it, baby. No stress at all. It was great. Everything just worked out

**[0:39:07]** Uh, we had a nice big spread set up outside in the in the yard

**[0:39:12]** Uh, yeah, just so so so nice

**[0:39:15]** That's beautiful because I this the only adjustment I should have made just

**[0:39:18]** I should I should have come by your house after kickball is the only adjustment

**[0:39:21]** I should have made yep

**[0:39:25]** Because that's the nice pack from you. Yep. Yep. I want to help you out with a nice pack

**[0:39:30]** also

**[0:39:31]** The best thing happened that I doubt I'll ever be able to repeat

**[0:39:36]** That is what's that we we had the big spread set up. We had all the people

**[0:39:41]** Uh, a couple hours later. I had to go to work. I'd do shows that night

**[0:39:44]** Uh, that's where I saw the uh, the injured sarah that night and we we talked about the kickball game of doom and uh

**[0:39:51]** I got home a couple hours later. There were still about five people at the house

**[0:39:56]** And the first thing that sj said to me when we when I got home was hey, there's no leftovers

**[0:40:02]** Everybody ate all of it. Wow

**[0:40:04]** Oh, wow

**[0:40:05]** Oh, my we did it. We did it. We got the exact right amount of food

**[0:40:11]** It got grazed on after the after the meal was over and it's just all gone. That's great. This is magical

**[0:40:17]** I took about like I you know grew up with uh with four brothers and a sister and uh

**[0:40:24]** We you know, I I am I am the shortest of my not by a lot, but I'm the shortest of my brothers. Uh,

**[0:40:31]** So, uh, never

**[0:40:33]** Never had leftovers. Yeah

**[0:40:35]** Never no no meal no meal leftover. Yeah, that checks out

**[0:40:40]** Y'all we're like leftovers. What is this? What is this concept?

**[0:40:47]** Uh

**[0:40:49]** Yeah, my mother-in-law does this thing where she insists on trying to make like a turkey soup with the turkey carcass of the

**[0:40:55]** turkey thing

**[0:40:58]** And like it's this it's this whole it's the thing that takes up the whole next day. Right, right

**[0:41:03]** Uh

**[0:41:04]** All that all that started was to make sure that sarah and I stopped cooking turkey. That's all that happened

**[0:41:09]** because that we just don't we just

**[0:41:11]** were like

**[0:41:13]** We don't want to spend the whole other day making soup and we don't want to spend the next four days eating that soup

**[0:41:17]** Yeah, uh, it's just not just not the world we live in

**[0:41:23]** Um, but uh, yeah

**[0:41:25]** But look I saw on instagram. It looks like you had a fine spread at your house there, Jacob

**[0:41:30]** Oh, yeah, no, it was it was so nice at uh, yeah, we had a we had a ton of people over and everything

**[0:41:34]** It was great. I love Thanksgiving. I don't know what y'all are talking about. I love doing the the whole meal

**[0:41:39]** I love doing all of it. It's it's great time

**[0:41:42]** I did too. I think it's my favorite holiday really

**[0:41:46]** I I promise I'm making a very good turkey. Yeah, um, I just wasn't simply alone in my house

**[0:41:52]** Uh, uh, as as nimble and famously said all Thanksgiving food tastes like napkins and that's what my kids think too

**[0:41:57]** So there you go

**[0:41:58]** And it was it really was this show that changed my perception. So at first I was like I have to as their dad

**[0:42:05]** Keep making it until they like it because that's the way it works and there's only on this show

**[0:42:09]** I found out so many listeners hate Thanksgiving food also as adults

**[0:42:14]** Oh

**[0:42:15]** You should show your boys. Do you ever watch uh, garen the guy out of ireland? He's very funny. He's gonna say

**[0:42:23]** Thanks for watching. I'm delicious

**[0:42:26]** You ever seen him? He's really funny

**[0:42:28]** No, no, he's he's really really funny. You should look up some of garen's stuff, but he did

**[0:42:33]** from ireland

**[0:42:35]** Just a couple days ago. He cooked his own version of a traditional american Thanksgiving dinner

**[0:42:42]** And uh, I was very surprised by what he liked and what he didn't like

**[0:42:47]** So he was okay with the turkey

**[0:42:50]** Okay, um

**[0:42:52]** He hated craft macaroni and cheese box dinner

**[0:42:57]** The box fine, which I mean, I guess yeah, that's not really Thanksgiving food. Anyway, well mac and cheese

**[0:43:03]** Mac and cheese is a Thanksgiving food. And that's what people I suppose so sure people getting shit

**[0:43:07]** You're you're bringing a very fiery debate. Yeah, there are people that

**[0:43:10]** That insist that mac and cheese is not a Thanksgiving food people says that it is

**[0:43:14]** I don't think it was a Thanksgiving food, but I'm not upset if I see it show up. I love it. I love it

**[0:43:19]** Uh, mashed potatoes. He made his own mashed potatoes. He has a special recipe for the mashed potatoes

**[0:43:23]** So he wasn't expecting the mashed potatoes to be anything but delicious. They were

**[0:43:27]** He made kind of a cheese that he put in his mashed potatoes. What kind of cheese?

**[0:43:31]** What kind of white cheese does he put in there? Oh, no, he does not do the no no

**[0:43:35]** He doesn't do the cheese

**[0:43:38]** It's just curds and way it's barely even cheese. It's like halfway done

**[0:43:42]** um

**[0:43:43]** So, uh, then he had the green bean casserole

**[0:43:47]** Which he was very suspicious of

**[0:43:50]** But he liked

**[0:43:52]** Yep, I like a green bean casserole and then he made pumpkin pie

**[0:43:55]** Which they don't do pumpkin pie in ireland at all apparently

**[0:44:00]** No, they do potato pie. Yeah, but I mean they don't mash potatoes

**[0:44:03]** They don't do pumpkin pie at all

**[0:44:06]** And he was really super suspicious about it all

**[0:44:10]** But he made it and he really liked it. He was suspicious of the pie

**[0:44:14]** He was suspicious of the pie. He did he he was took him

**[0:44:18]** Some time to get over the he's he was like, oh, it's got this vegetabley

**[0:44:22]** Uh mush to it. I'm not used to like a dessert

**[0:44:26]** And he says and then I went on and I watched all your fucking videos of all your fucking celebrations

**[0:44:31]** And I saw how all you got all you only got these these yam potatoes all these sweet potatoes with fucking marshmallows on top

**[0:44:38]** So many fucking marshmallows get fucked. I don't want marshmallows anywhere near my dinner. That's bullshit

**[0:44:45]** I do agree with that. I don't want the marshmallows. I agree with that too. He says he says I know a lot of you say it's great

**[0:44:50]** I don't know

**[0:44:52]** More power to you keep those fucking things away from me. It's secretly deserting early

**[0:44:56]** That's what I don't like about it

**[0:44:57]** Yeah, it's like what's it because what I have marshmallows and sugar and brown sugar and cinnamon on something

**[0:45:01]** I'm like well now I don't want to eat savory things anymore. You you shift my gear to dessert

**[0:45:05]** Right. It's unfair. Yeah, it's like it's like a hip it's hip prop

**[0:45:09]** Like we do we do the uh the the sweet potatoes we do the sweet potato casserole

**[0:45:14]** It's got brown sugar and pecans and everything. It's not healthy. It's not it's not a uh

**[0:45:18]** It's definitely still a dessert masquerading as uh as a dish

**[0:45:22]** But uh, it doesn't do the full on swing over with the marshmallows

**[0:45:27]** Sweet potato the masquerade

**[0:45:31]** Um

**[0:45:33]** Uh

**[0:45:34]** Galactic president scooper star McScoops a lot

**[0:45:36]** Stuffing on a waffle iron. That sounds amazing stuffing on a waffle iron is legit. I saw that earlier. I've seen that before

**[0:45:44]** It's a that's a fucking idea

**[0:45:46]** Do you put a little gravy on it and then kind of sear it all in is that how it goes?

**[0:45:51]** I think your gravy afterward though. You have like a little

**[0:45:53]** A little I suppose you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you just make it

**[0:45:57]** I think you want the hot gravy. Yeah, nice hot gravy then pour it on after you waffle iron it

**[0:46:02]** Because when you get something that has crispiness and moisture, that's the key. Yeah, right

**[0:46:06]** So that's that's that seems really good. That sounds fucking good

**[0:46:11]** But paul wants the hot crispified some gravy, which is also ambitious

**[0:46:16]** As long as it has a skin

**[0:46:20]** Give me that give me that skin

**[0:46:23]** Give me that gravy skin. No gravy skin is not

**[0:46:26]** Not no, that's no good

**[0:46:28]** How dare you

**[0:46:29]** No, I'm just uh, I'm just upset because uh

**[0:46:33]** Well, I'm I'm not I'm not I upset is the wrong word

**[0:46:37]** disappointed lightly

**[0:46:38]** That I can't just go get the food that I want on my birthday without driving an hour and a half out of my way

**[0:46:46]** Yeah, like it's literally an hour and a half drive for me to get even fucking panda express

**[0:46:52]** It's like

**[0:46:54]** This conversation for me must be what it's like when the topic is football for other scoops

**[0:47:03]** You're horse racing. Yeah

**[0:47:07]** Yes, not so express you're absolutely right rich

**[0:47:10]** Yes, it takes way too fucking long so I and that's the thing it's by the time I get back home

**[0:47:15]** I'm like, oh, well

**[0:47:17]** I drove an hour and a half for panda express

**[0:47:20]** You might as well just give fucking mcdonald's. It's just it's turned into

**[0:47:24]** Shit at that point

**[0:47:26]** I mean that's the same thing, right?

**[0:47:28]** Kind of panda expressing mcdonald's or it didn't even say it's all owned by the same company, right? Well, we're thinking of uh

**[0:47:35]** Maybe going to cost go on wednesday

**[0:47:38]** I'll get that good old hot dog

**[0:47:40]** That'll be my so what did you guys what did you guys think of wicked too? Didn't see it

**[0:47:45]** What? No, I didn't see you didn't rush out to see the sequel. I did not I've only seen it seven or eight times

**[0:47:50]** Uh, so I I don't really have a fully flushed out opinion on it yet

**[0:47:58]** I know it's really cool when they breakdanced to save the car wash

**[0:48:03]** I thought it was really amazing

**[0:48:06]** Have you seen that is that what you're talking about that?

**[0:48:11]** no, there's

**[0:48:13]** There's a bit I'm talking about the plot of break in two

**[0:48:17]** Okay, well, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind to show you some shit that you

**[0:48:22]** You're not gonna show me anything, please

**[0:48:24]** Show us something ball. It's an audio program. I'm gonna tell you about it as it's happening

**[0:48:31]** You're gonna narrate it to us. Oh good

**[0:48:35]** First it's like a long time pulling up though. I don't know if I have the plot right from break in two

**[0:48:39]** I'm not looking it up. I'm just we're just moving on

**[0:48:42]** No, all it is is it's the old donnie and marie

**[0:48:45]** Uh

**[0:48:46]** Or the osmonds that's what it or no no wasn't the osmonds. It was a fucking money call. It's a brady bunch

**[0:48:52]** Uh, the break you remember the brady bunch had it had a

**[0:48:55]** They're providing show. Yes

**[0:48:57]** Yeah, yeah, where um one of the kids I forget which which kid one of the kids got replaced on it

**[0:49:02]** Because they couldn't get the whole original cast back together

**[0:49:06]** That is correct. I think it was one of the young kids. It was just like a new kid

**[0:49:10]** Oh jan. Thank you. You like the president. Yep. They had to replace the jan

**[0:49:14]** Well, what you just and jan sickly stuck upstairs. She was cutting

**[0:49:18]** Ropes to see different obviously would fall from the top of the theater and there's a cliffhanger

**[0:49:22]** The first cliffhanger ever

**[0:49:24]** What you just joked about matt happened

**[0:49:27]** And it happened with none other than rip taylor as the cowardly lion

**[0:49:34]** And the rest of fucking brady's dressed up like the people from os

**[0:49:39]** Doing the theme from car wash. They're doing car wash at the car wash. Yeah, and

**[0:49:45]** Fucking greg brady dressed up like the scarecrow and rip taylor is the lion to be in as flamboyant as he can be

**[0:49:53]** Just out of hand and I thought this would be really funny for somebody to slip into a copy or one of the edits of

**[0:50:01]** Uh os 2 or wicked 2 wouldn't it be really funny if this showed up? I'll uh, you know, um

**[0:50:09]** Somebody's just like watching that on tv in the background or something

**[0:50:11]** No, no, it would you know, what's the on tv in the background? I don't know tv. No, what's uh

**[0:50:17]** Fight club like in fight club. Remember how uh, he would always slip in little snippets of pornographic stuff

**[0:50:24]** And all the movies if you could put this in

**[0:50:27]** And just make everybody upset

**[0:50:30]** That is true. That is true. We gotta do that. That is quite a fever dream as none of the elements make sense at all

**[0:50:36]** No, it's fucking bizarre

**[0:50:39]** And and rip taylor evolved a rip. Yeah rip taylor of all people you think like if you you'll never get rich

**[0:50:45]** But it beats digging a ditch

**[0:50:50]** I think I said you guys the funny the me my song which is that uh, don't worry glinda and alphabet will be back in avengers

**[0:50:56]** Uh

**[0:51:06]** That's awesome

**[0:51:06]** Tick-tock and

**[0:51:08]** The guy

**[0:51:10]** He's a madham madham. What now madham mova or whatever name is, you know, there's dolls of all these figures, right?

**[0:51:17]** There's dolls. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, sure. So he's got all the dolls stacked up

**[0:51:22]** And then madham mova

**[0:51:25]** Comes in and it's playing that that song from the drag race stuff

**[0:51:29]** And here comes the hurricane bitch Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina Katrina. She's not getting

**[0:51:37]** And the bow comes down and crushes

**[0:51:42]** It's fucking funny Katrina Katrina Katrina here comes the hurricane bitch yelling Katrina. It's funny

**[0:51:50]** It makes me laugh. So what what did you really like it? Did you not like it?

**[0:51:56]** Oh, that was fun. That was good. That was good. Would you be able to watch it all in one sitting?

**[0:52:02]** Yes

**[0:52:03]** That's that's that's my only takeaway is they added three songs to it and those three songs aren't on par with the actual

**[0:52:10]** Chorus soundtrack. Yeah to basically strike to basically make the second

**[0:52:16]** Movie fill out. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:52:19]** Is it they're not terrible. There's not there's just there's nothing to is it closer to the book or the

**[0:52:26]** Musical do you know

**[0:52:28]** I wouldn't know

**[0:52:29]** Because my wife wouldn't know either my wife loved the book

**[0:52:32]** And we went to see the musical and she was so upset because the ending is oh really

**[0:52:38]** Yeah, the ending is so different and just all had to carry her out of there like it was a Thanksgiving day prank

**[0:52:44]** I threw her on my back and she laughed the whole way home

**[0:52:50]** It was crazy

**[0:52:52]** It undercuts the meaning of the whole

**[0:52:55]** Story the ending scooper nova girl in the chat says that it's the musical on screen nothing added from the book. Well, that's unfortunate

**[0:53:03]** For an yeah, because that musical did did so poorly, but um, no, I don't like the musical

**[0:53:08]** No, the the ending of the musical is

**[0:53:10]** bupkus deus ex machina bullshit

**[0:53:14]** That's everything now though. I guess you're right. There's so much

**[0:53:17]** People are coming movies for happy endings, dude. Yeah

**[0:53:20]** Yeah

**[0:53:20]** I'm not worried about that. Like there's so much of that any tv show I watch any movie

**[0:53:26]** I watch like half of them now at least have the have the uh

**[0:53:30]** God from the machine. Yes the deus ex machina

**[0:53:33]** Just some kind of supernatural thing or somebody comes in or something

**[0:53:37]** But something off-screen happens and the plot resolves itself

**[0:53:40]** Do we know do do our do our audience members?

**[0:53:43]** I think most of our audience members know deus ex machina

**[0:53:45]** But you know where that really comes from from back in the day in early theater

**[0:53:49]** There was actually a hand. Yeah, the greeks. Yeah, the greeks had an actual hand of god

**[0:53:54]** That would come down from the top of the

**[0:53:57]** The thing and touch characters or zap characters and that was a way to resolve plots by actual

**[0:54:03]** Divine intervention. Yeah, they would they would just say like, uh, you know medea is doing all of these things

**[0:54:10]** Uh off off stage right now, right and then the gods intervened intervened and and now it is this

**[0:54:17]** And now here comes everybody to bow. Yep

**[0:54:20]** Yeah, there you go. Uh, yeah, I was told that people kind of get all off script

**[0:54:24]** And kind of go haywire with stories and stuff and and and so like that was a way to like just clean everything up

**[0:54:29]** Yeah, yeah, and uh, somebody did 10 minutes of uh, shake spirit magic

**[0:54:32]** I can tell you we can go haywire fast. I'll bet you go haywire. I'll bet it go lose. He lose. You know, you

**[0:54:37]** ought to do that again

**[0:54:40]** No, we're gonna

**[0:54:41]** Paul might have to take a flight. We might have to do a thing

**[0:54:43]** I would I honestly think I would fucking I want to I want to I want to see brand schedule, but I want to submit it for uh

**[0:54:50]** Uh fallout fringe. Oh, oh, yes

**[0:54:53]** That'd be really fun. Yeah

**[0:54:56]** um

**[0:54:57]** So I you know for people going to see the movie. I don't want to you know, it's a good movie

**[0:55:01]** I don't want to pass the whole thing. Uh, yeah

**[0:55:03]** There's just one part that really stuck out to me that I was really really like like really laughing because it almost took me out of it

**[0:55:09]** So this whole thing's like basically family friendly pg ish pg 13 ish

**[0:55:14]** story

**[0:55:16]** but there's a part where

**[0:55:18]** The prince has got to get it on with somebody they they they they they run off and they they they're finally by themselves and they're gonna

**[0:55:24]** There's there's a hookup that's going to happen. Oh, yeah

**[0:55:28]** And it is the weirdest shot

**[0:55:31]** thing

**[0:55:33]** Ever it's like this weird like it's like it looked like an old chris isaac music video

**[0:55:37]** Like everything from one room to another

**[0:55:41]** And like

**[0:55:44]** It took me out of it completely. I literally was like almost laughing. I was like, what is the scene?

**[0:55:50]** Because I can't like just show them getting it on right? So there's

**[0:55:53]** Wicked games the title of the song is wicked games

**[0:56:00]** That's what it must have been

**[0:56:02]** That must have been

**[0:56:07]** You don't know the wicked games video listeners do yourself a favor and google the wicked games video

**[0:56:15]** So it's like the characters from one room to another like taking off clothing, but then also putting on clothing

**[0:56:20]** Like that's great. Bizarre

**[0:56:22]** Someone said big ups to modern love whereas someone puts on a sensible shawl to have sex

**[0:56:31]** Oh gen alpha

**[0:56:33]** The sex card is now I think

**[0:56:35]** Matt I don't want to frighten you but if you back up just a little bit

**[0:56:39]** Back back your head up just a little bit. There you go. Perfect. Stay right there

**[0:56:43]** Everybody in the chat

**[0:56:45]** don't move

**[0:56:46]** Is it me or is the shadow of the babadook behind him?

**[0:56:53]** Am I crazy? Is that the shadow of the fucking babadook over there? Yeah. Yeah

**[0:56:58]** It's the babadook

**[0:57:03]** The little top

**[0:57:08]** Why are you worried about a giant shadow of a big cartoon great day behind me?

**[0:57:13]** You know, they talk about

**[0:57:17]** He's gonna get you they talk about they talk about you know within

**[0:57:23]** Spooky stuff ghosty stories that they talk about the hat man and all that kind of thing

**[0:57:26]** Babadook definitely qualifies as a hat man. Yeah, that's pretty scary. That's kind of creepy

**[0:57:33]** All right, well have a good night sleeping tonight with the babadook uh in there. Yeah, no babadook is now a gay icon

**[0:57:41]** So I think you're safe

**[0:57:44]** It truly is babadook has now been taken over by the gays, which I think is awesome. Oh good. Yeah

**[0:57:50]** The gays do good work. They fucking do they rehab the babadook of all of all critters
