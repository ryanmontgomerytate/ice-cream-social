14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,440
 preaching fun I like Taskmaster it's a huge fan of how did this get made the

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,040
 podcast with Paul Scheer and Jason Manzoukas who has done Taskmaster in the

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,080
 past I don't know if he's on this season or not that well just imagine and I

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,600
 haven't got it I just informed by a friend but just imagine because basically

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
 wrote them being like why aren't I on this show and like barge this way on it

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,720
 got us himself invited onto the show yeah but it's an English show and you

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,680
 have English comedians or British comedians on there and it's the snarky

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,840
 hosts co-hosts and they put people through like random tasks would have to

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
 be very creative or justify their answers it's all very like very funny

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,440
 and I didn't know about the show and turned out a friend of ours their

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,300
 daughter was I'm being informed that's that's not snarky it's just British fair

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:21,560
 enough and their daughter was totally into this show and so we decided they're

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,760
 going to throw a Taskmaster themed birthday party so what happened was they

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,320
 need a taskmaster coach out to California and and they couldn't come

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,680
 without bringing a gift because every on the show every community has to bring a

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:48,280
 gift with a certain theme ah and the theme had to be rain and sticky was the

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,320
 was the theme of the of the so everybody brought her a rain stick and a press on

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,640
 a press of Audrey there was rain and sticky and someone could have you could

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,080
 have done that but the problem is if you watch the show if you something

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,480
 predictable then the snarky slash just British hosts will slam you and not give

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,600
 you points so you have to surprise they'll be British at you and give

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,200
 points and so at first I was like I cannot believe that I'm driving my kids

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,760
 out to California and I'm giving them homework right but I start watching the

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
 show with my kids and they haven't seen it either the prep and the show is

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,960
 really great like it's really funny I'm gonna have to check it out it's it's

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:30,280
 really great and Jacob what gift would you bring under the restrictions of

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,360
 rain oh I glad you asked I already thought about it I would bring a bottle

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,480
 of pancake syrup that's exactly what I was gonna do I was gonna do a mrs.

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,760
 Butterworth dressed up like a queen oh no no I'm going to have somebody else

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,040
 sit in a chair I'm going to do a sticky rain on them oh I was gonna have the

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,080
 queen the queen mrs. Butterworth she would have the rain of sticky oh that's

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,480
 good too I like that there's a bit of a pun what about you Matt what did you

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,800
 end up bringing her so help my kids out with two different ones my one kid

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,400
 decided to make a fortune-telling jar of answers to any questions that he had

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,520
 with a with a fishing pole with a and this the hook was sticky it was a ball

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,880
 of sticky tape so great he basically wrote like yes no maybe ask again fill

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,000
 in the blank hell no oh he didn't write a whole bunch of like really super

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,320
 specific answers and just drop it in there I know you should not invest in

52
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,520
 that property yeah and then my other kid took an umbrella wrote the most

53
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,080
 impressive thing on the umbrella with sticky notes and dropped glue sticks

54
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,000
 from strings from each prong on the on the umbrella so he opened up the great

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,340
 with an umbrella of glue sticks he won he won the challenge with the really

56
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,160
 with the glue stick umbrella yeah he's he's good at a lot of things this was a

57
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:09,000
 like 24-hour event this was my friend went way the fuck overboard so they were

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,800
 throwing a birthday party for their child with all the kids the next day

59
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,560
 but the chosen five were to be contestants in in the in the contest for

60
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,640
 the whole day the day before they're doing all of that and then having a

61
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,640
 birthday party after that yes I was like that is crazy that's too much you need

62
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,640
 to have an intervention with these people like no one loves their child as

63
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,700
 much no one no so we had our objects I load up with all the stuff they needed

64
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,840
 for their sleepover and they were tasks waiting at the door before you enter the

65
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,320
 house so it's like they have these like little ornate envelopes with like the

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,440
 red wax kind of sticky on them or whatever uh-huh and I my two children's

67
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,920
 they've been given two different assignments one was told to enter the

68
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:08,560
 house in the most annoying way please I don't even know I don't even want to

69
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,640
 know which kid that was that go on and then the other kid was told enter the

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:21,760
 house in the smartest way mm-hmm both kids instantly had an idea great so one

71
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,640
 kid who had the annoying assignment just opens door and goes hey six seven six

72
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:34,640
 seven six seven six seven six seven six seven and this does it and my other kid

73
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,040
 just threw his stuff at me and ran around the house like went to find

74
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,920
 another way in to the house yeah and so I entered behind the kid who got the

75
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,360
 annoying assignment and said you got to go find my other kiddies coming in some

76
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,440
 other part of your house probably good luck to everyone involved uh you know

77
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,040
 they were given like all kinds of crazy tasks and the birthday girl was the

78
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:07,720
 hosts and the my co-hosts and they literally ran the whole afternoon with

79
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,360
 games and tasks for five of her friends to compete in in the contest that took

80
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,960
 place all day you know I'm thinking about I think this is a girl parent

81
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,560
 versus boy parent difference you say that Jacob just but I had just a

82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
 demonstration of how much harder it is to be a girl parent it is to be a boy

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,280
 definitely is it definitely is different challenges for sure I I would say though

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,400
 too like some people birthdays are way more of a thing like yeah with my yes

85
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,480
 wife's family birthdays are big big deal you get to eat wherever you want everybody

86
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,440
 has to go along like it's a it's a it's a thing yes my my family wasn't that big

87
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,040
 of a oh it means occasionally it would be a big thing when we were little

88
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,720
 little littler but you know it wasn't it was in our house it was able to be

89
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,220
 shuffled around like we still would do like a dinner yes where or event but it

90
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,220
 was like hey this brother has a basketball game this brother is a

91
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,080
 football game this is like we need to do it next Saturday especially you got that

92
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,520

 something like that some kind of celebration thing and we're gonna do it

95
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,960
 at some point did you have a heavy month Matt was there a triple sibling with my

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:42,360

97
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,080
 no we were pretty we're pretty spread out actually with my fam oh that can be

98
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,560
 a trouble with the period - yeah June July we have a June and July August three

109
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,200
 thing but I thought it was awesome nice yeah when he's little you just don't

110

 I've never worn contacts I I have readers hit me all over my house like

159
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,280
 like Easter eggs on Easter okay every room has like a pair of readers I've

160
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,800
 just thrown there just in case and what what number reader are you purchasing

161
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,000
 and hiding around your house that's the round one with a big stick at the end of

162
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 it and it's like that's it that's a real big you know one seven five once that's

163
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,040
 not too bad okay okay good good yeah I've recently started hiding readers

164
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,480
 around my house as well that just go along with my contacts because now my

165
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
 farsightedness is is thinking about starting to catch up with my

166
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,920
 nearsightedness fine which is going real real bad for Jacob seeing any hit the

167
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:18,800
 to Jacob let's hit the to middle-aged white guy let's do it because I need I

168
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,000
 need I've added one to the kitchen so I used to have one wherever I'd sit and

169
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
 look at my phone there's a pair of glasses I look at my phone and then I

170
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:41,040
 started for directions on stuff to cook I had a pair I have a pair next to my

171
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,560
 chair and having a pair next to my bed I just have to just just a two around the

172
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,280
 house well at first my and this is really fascinating for listeners but at

173
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,600
 first like you know obviously reading tiny things was was where it started

174
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,200
 just not being able to look at look at small things so so did you have the same

175
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,280
 did you have the same reaction that I did when I started to not be able to

176
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,840
 read my comic books I was like what the fuck is wrong with this printing and the

177
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,280
 same with like macaroni and cheese instructions and things like that I'd be

178
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,280
 like who is this font for what yeah what Lilliputians are picking up these boxes

179
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,400
 this is ridiculous yes yeah and now the problem might be me you see the TV above

180
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,040
 my head that's the bet that's the TV in my bedroom so my I'm further away from

181
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,600
 the TV than like a regular TV viewing kind of thing uh-huh now I'm having hard

182
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,920
 time seeing the subtitles on shows I'm watching from there so now the other

183
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,440
 side's going too so yeah it's time that's both ends it's time but I would

184
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,480
 right after yeah right after this episode I'm running over to Pearl Vision

185
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,240
 oh nice yeah so they said yes we can't help but not today that's right yeah

186
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,560
 that was let's do it let's do a whole appointment we'll do the whole thing

187
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,480
 which gave me some time you know give me some time to think about it and so I

188
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,400
 started buying a lot of supplements off of Amazon and I think I spent this I'm

189
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,960
 trying to cure my eyesight train your eyes train your eyes in three days so I

190
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:22,880
 called back never mind I'm fine right as rain click I saw some tic-tocker he's

191
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,720
 like problem solved when I tell you about where these glasses he's got these

192
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,480
 glasses that just have nothing but little pinholes in them I wear these and

193
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:40,600
 that fixes my eyes I'm like fuck you do fuck it does you lying at the you hope

194
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,420
 it does yeah I understand that you would like it too it doesn't know the idea

195
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,640
 like look I know medical costs and medical care in this country is

196
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,480
 complicated annoying and expensive everything else but the idea that it's a

197
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,840
 constant just like no we don't want anyone to know that the simple blank

198
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,080
 exists so that we can just rake in the dough on every single ailment that we've

199
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,360
 come up with it's just a little much sometimes yes it is I don't want to sit

200
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,800
 around defend the medical industry but I don't think that the whole eye doctor

201
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,640
 industry is like shit hope they don't figure out pinhole glasses that we're

202
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,800
 doing like yeah my eyes here's how bad the the medical insurance here is my

203
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,960
 eyes are terrible we've talked about that in show before my eyes are horrible

204
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,360
 you've never seen me without contacts or glasses I can't function without at

205
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,320
 least one of those things and like if this weren't this century if this were

206
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,520
 just a few hundred years ago I would just be dead in the woods somewhere

207
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,640
 right remember there's an old like back like a decade ago an old Netflix show I

208
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,700
 think it's called yeah it was a Western show and it had a guy his glasses broke

209
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,640
 on like a on the terrain and he's yeah and he spent the rest of the series like

210
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,800
 not able to see and I was like holy shit yes I was like oh my god you don't think

211
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:07,100
 about that like my worst fear on vacation is like if I leave town if my

212
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,040
 contacts or glasses get fucked up yeah I can't do anything yeah I'm just done

213
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,420
 no you will cut pinholes and two pieces I would fashion a mask out of it like a

214
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:29,320
 placemat you would tape it to your head just pinhole your way around Portugal

215
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:37,560
 and I'd be fine then I'd be fine but no our insurance is so bad like I have good

216
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,520
 I have good insurance I have good health insurance I've good medical and vision

217
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,600
 insurance all that kind of stuff there is a surgery that could fix my eyes my

218
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,640
 eyes are so bad I can't do like the LASIK thing and so the surgery is

219
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,120
 basically a cataract surgery where they they take that lens out and they put a

220
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,480
 corrective lens in in its place and then it's just an implanted contact lenses is

221
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,960
 basically all it is probably safer than LASIK maybe I have no idea who knows but

222
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,960
 I do know what it does is is it keeps you from getting cataracts later in life

223
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,440
 it's also it's also a preemptive surgery for cataracts preventative because you're

224
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,560
 doing the cataract surgery before you have cataracts smart with my

225
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,680
 astigmatism I'm very likely to have cataracts they will not pay for that

226
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,720
 surgery now until they will pay for cataract surgery until you get they will

227
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,200
 not it's not they will not pay for the surgery that would also correct my

228
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,000
 vision because that's that's an elective surgery even though I will almost

229
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,960
 certainly get cataracts in the future and then I'll have to have the surgery

230
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,280
 anyway yeah it's fucked it's really stupid it is it's stupid it's awful I

231
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,200
 mean one and this is the kind of obstacles I faced as a man of size

232
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,120
 trying to address my hip issue for years you know and just being basically you

233
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,360
 know dismissed out of hand by the first guy I went to because the doctor didn't

234
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
 have the appropriate eye prescription and couldn't see you well he could see

235
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,560
 me and he was like he was like look here fatty and I was like put these put these

236
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,480
 pinhole glasses on and you can only eat things that fit in this pinhole I just

237
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,760
 I'll never get over I'll never get over the glory hole diet the the the actual

238
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,720
 guy that actually helped help me and fix my leg and the fact that when they got

239
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,840
 in into my hip socket they were like it was basically deteriorated into fragments

240
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,000
 and dust yeah well we're really surprised how you were walking on that

241
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 as am I I told you this for you it's fucked if y'all listen to him bitch

242
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,140
 about it for the whole time you wouldn't be that surprised your buddy yeah Jacob

243
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:56,480
 and I were not it was better than what we thought it was gonna be but this is

244
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,000
 the same thing like why the fuck don't I just you know and it's it's worse for

245
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,780
 women I know that too like it's one thing to be a heavy dude but it but if

246
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,040
 you're a woman forget it my god the shit the fucking race the only aspect where

247
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,120
 it's hard to be a woman than a man but thank goodness only applies in the

248
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:23,840
 medical field oh yeah yeah just well well everybody has a good day I'll keep

249
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,000
 you posted well Jacob do you think there's any way that you could possibly

250
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,800
 rectify this because I know that there has recently been a kerfuffle on

251
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,720
 tik-tok I don't know what other social media sites you frequent or our party to

252
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,360
 but there was a guy on tik-tok I'm pretty much just I'm pretty much just

253
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,840
 tick-tock Paul I just do lots and lots of tick-tock well he needed he needed a

254
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,280
 liver transplant right okay and the the insurance would not cover it they would

255
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,240
 not go through with it he was ready to do it and you know he was gonna die and

256
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:11,040
 so he raised a bit of a stink on on his tik-tok page and it went very viral and

257
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,680
 what do you know sure enough they turned around and they did the surgery and he's

258
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,840
 gonna live but it takes a couple of million strangers screaming at these

259
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:30,240
 mega corporations to say hey help this person it's fucked up I'm the same way I

260
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,960
 won't do that I won't help anyone until there's millions of people experiencing

261
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,560
 intermittent or outrage I would also like a liver though so if everyone could

262
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,480
 please raise a lot of outrage get Jacob a liver I don't want it I don't want any

263
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,080
 surgery I just want the liver put it on ice by the way it's a little update on

264
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,400
 the old duo lingo I've after when I was suggested to be friends with my dead

265
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,680
 friend I since I've got a lot of scoops and other people follow me on duo lingo

266
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,480
 I'm following everybody back I think it's gonna be really funny if my most

267
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,160
 popular social media outlet is duo lingo I am eating apples I am drinking water I

268
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,400
 am you know eating pan I'm asking people they speak English or Espanol I'm on a

269
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,160
 roll I'm on a roll yeah but but in terms of like hey do does your phone listen to

270
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,880
 do apps listen to other topics and try to compete with each other my Instagram

271
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:39,160
 apparently was very jealous of duo lingo uh-huh so that they gave me not one but

272
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,560
 two friend suggestions for two people who are dead they two dead friends they

273
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,280
 offer me to follow back two dead friends just one and two right there first two

274
00:25:49,280 --> 00:26:01,080
 many dead friends follow why would you compete with this I think actually Matt

275
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,720
 you have inadvertently subscribed to cul-de-sac which is the new app that

276
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:15,600
 just has you trapped in a dead friends and escape I have a lot of friends on

277
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:27,680
 seance have you guys downloaded seance you wanted to say Spanish you got the

278
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,160
 seance you wanted to say Spanish yeah that's right that's right

279
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,200
 chaotic points out in chat that my duolingo streak is better than my dead

280
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,280
 friends so there you go you got that going for me those are wins or wins might

281
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,880
 not have made the Myler's Club but goddamn it that streak is on no problem

282
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,920
 what are we getting buried with our phones what's the plan here what are we

283
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,720
 doing with our phones I don't know what the hypothesis that made that what's

284
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,200
 that how does that answer a question I don't know I'm just thinking like maybe

285
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,060
 you keep it plugged in throw some kind of bullshit AI on it and let it keep

286
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,880
 chirping and chipping away at people long after you're dead me like hey man

287
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,400
 what's up you know it's like wait I thought you're fucking dead yeah I'm dead

288
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,800
 so what my it's just Paul having weird dark thoughts over here I'm doing fine

289
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,880
 that's precisely like that's it I can't think of a more tech bro idea they'd be

290
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,840
 like I want to be great when you as your AI self can let other people know you're

291
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,000
 dead so to find out from anyone else yeah I mean I mean your brain knows for

292
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,120
 like six minutes or something like that they say so hey yeah great yeah phones

293
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,000
 are waterproof now so it doesn't that doesn't take Throshen off the table you

294
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,360
 know right gates Throshen still there and I can still it's basically I'd be

295
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,160
 talking to you from the grave and a submarine it's like the same time well

296
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,120
 now the only the only challenge is keeping it powered that's the challenge

297
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,000
 is how do you keep the battery going hey how you doing this is the AI Jacob how

298
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,160
 are you I hope you're doing well Jacob is not doing well at all he has passed

299
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,760
 away I am really sorry to be the one to tell you about this I am 100% sorry that

300
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,880
 Jacob has passed away and I am 200% sorry to have to be the one to tell you

301
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,960
 about haha yes of course you said yeah you're a good friend and Jacob was you

302
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,200
 to know that really good job would you like me to break down three different

303
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,000
 ways for you to pay homage to Jacob by the way that might fit your comfortable

304
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:40,440
 lifestyle I know you don't like my firms wait wait I like it I like it yeah this

305
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,240
 is gonna be a new thing it's definitely gonna be a new thing yeah yeah well I

306
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,880
 mean there's plenty of gravestones with QR codes and shit on them and that

307
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,080
 stuff's not gonna stay around forever it's just weird I don't know grave

308
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,320
 gravestone QR code is actually that sounds better to me than what we just

309
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:04,520
 came up with that seems like oh how so the idea of just strolling through a

310
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,840
 graveyard and scanning QR codes is both beautiful and horrifying you can do it

311
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,360
 right now there's plenty of graves with QR codes you can scan it up to bring up

312
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,480
 a little memorial and pictures and videos and stuff yeah yeah that's what I

313
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,680
 want I want people on their phones you know like I really want people just be

314
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:33,640
 in tech just in their day-to-day shit grieve through the screen put these VR

315
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:43,800
 glasses on and grieve give me your grief in AI AI grief so my oldest kids a spoiled

316
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,840
 brat he's this this this week ends with him going thank God you figured it out

317
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,000
 first this this week ends with him going to the

318
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,720
 sphere with his schoolmates to see Wizard of Oz which we still haven't seen

319
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,240
 uh-huh and then the next day they go to Disneyland with the show choir that's

320
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:12,520
 that's his Thursday Friday this week tough tough days but the message we got

321
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,720
 for the sphere was hysterical okay so like one is that we have to fill out

322
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,480
 photo and press releases for our children in order for them to go you

323
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,280
 can't go unless you fill out a photo release because both the sphere and the

324
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,280
 school need to put bus to publicize the event they're having school kids visit

325
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:42,040
 the sphere okay what's what's gonna be shown is I got a show in the big nature

326
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,320
 film Wizard of Oz yeah no one cares about nature anymore Paul that was when

327
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,480
 the sphere opened I don't think they even do the nature film anymore

328
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,800
 and then Lauren Shreve is it sounds expensive it is we fundraised throughout

329
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,560
 the year you know it's it's death by a thousand donations with schools they

330
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,880
 just keep beating you with the same fundraisers I have no idea how much

331
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,480
 money we gave to make this happen but I know that it happened in like several

332
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,560
 several increments of time do you think that you gave more money to this than

333
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,920
 you would have given if you just paid for the kids to go to these events well

334
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,200
 certainly Disneyland because their grandmother has a pass so yeah so more

335
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,600
 than free more than free you should be like yeah you can take my kid to

336
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,040
 Disneyland hold on I'll set up his ticket then the sphere had a breakdown

337
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,520
 that was like hey there'll be no book bags or any kind of carrying permitted

338
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,900
 into the sphere not even water bottles you can't bring water bottles or

339
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,800
 anything into the sphere nothing your children will come in as they are

340
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:01,400
 dressed that's it okay and we will not sell any food or beverage to anyone while

341
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,560
 they're in the sphere this is the second no this is no this is I get this

342
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,840
 because you get one peanut allergy and it's all downhill bottles of water no

343
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,000
 you don't want nothing it's the desert look give them some water go get your

344
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,840
 own camel back or where's our camel fuck that's the first line of the sand I've

345
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,760
 seen with anyone with school kids and their access to water there's one thing

346
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,800
 the kids have just been able to be fucking nuts with is that they must have

347
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,240
 access to these oh my god they're so hydrated these children now so hydrated

348
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:45,400
 Mark Gates is no peanut water there's a market salty and delicious peanut water

349
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,640
 hey look at that is that official Waffle House merch it's official Waffle House

350
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,520
 bunk yeah did you buy that at a Waffle House I bought it off the Waffle House

351
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,680
 website because I was waving about Waffle House website send me Waffle House stuff

352
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,120
 and I was like what there's nothing here oh we're usable coffee mug yeah look at

353
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,320
 that I like that it wasn't the yellows this is the blue one that is a subtle

354
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,080
 Waffle House and but yeah so so the kids didn't go there they're they may starve

355
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,520
 while they are in there but that's what's gonna happen go in there and then

356
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,160
 have no evidence that they were ever there ninjas they must come in right

357
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,080
 without a trace there's just gonna be a whole sphere filled with starved and

358
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,440
 desiccated children stuck like mummies to all the little chairs just I just want

359
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,140
 to know what the sphere is gonna do when a busload of kids shows up and they're

360
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,120
 all carrying water bottles like yeah what are you gonna do it really feels

361
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,680
 like like whoever's running the actual like boots on the grounds part of the

362
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,520
 sphere doesn't have kids and like for like eight meetings they're like and

363
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,360
 there's a we have another request from school they're like Jesus Christ with

364
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,480
 these school kids want to come here god yeah yeah so I was like well might be

365
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,160
 good PR all right they better sign fine this is they better have no evidence

366
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,120
 they were ever fucking here they better not fucking pee or eat or drink or not

367
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:17,600
 like I want to it's like we pulled the bathrooms out there aren't bathrooms

368
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,960
 anymore we will bring them in through a series of locked chambers it's a bad

369
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:32,400
 idea idea to bring him there yeah any of it yeah yeah I think that I think the

370
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,160
 sphere is making a drastic error how about that do your kids are your kids

371
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,960
 familiar with the Wizard of Oz yes okay I wonder at what point well what part

372
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,560
 will we get to the point where people haven't seen the original Wizard of Oz

373
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,600
 enough to get what's going on at the sphere yeah I don't know I mean you know

374
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,960
 the whole thing is that the wicked wicked creates this extra more current

375
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,600
 right a city for the original that's true Oz yeah who wrote that book in a

376
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,800
 minute couldn't couldn't have thought that this was that this was gonna happen

377
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,220
 with that of all the you know quote-unquote IP the Wizard of Oz like

378
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,120
 you know that's a crazy it's a crazy ass weird psychedelic the guy who wrote

379
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,800
 wicked or the guy who wrote Wizard of Oz Wizard of Oz yeah the person who wrote

380
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,600
 the original yeah the wonderful world of Oz and all that stuff yeah that that's a

381
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,840
 Frank Baum right I think so bomb sounds right yeah so what's fascinating about

382
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:43,720
 him that Ann has continued to educate me on is that his wife is a woman of some

383
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,200
 renown who's now flying out of my head one of the suffragettes you can fly no

384
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:57,780
 no no I'll fucking find it but uh yeah his whole family situation was really

385
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,600
 really interesting and that's a big part of why he put women forward in much of

386
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,840
 his work because he he and his family especially his wife in the forefront of

387
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:16,800
 feminism in that time oh wow oh and it works women have it so easy though no

388
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,760
 good job everybody no but it's great I didn't realize that and it's good it's

389
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,580
 good that it's good that it just puts women forward and I don't necessarily

390
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:34,160
 make it like oh it's a pro-woman thing so it's good oh pro-women oh bro all right

391
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,360
 yeah so I still haven't got anything in the sphere so my kids will like it will

392
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,240
 beat me to the sphere experience there do you have a desire to do anything you

393
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,000
 want to go see at the sphere I don't have like an eight hundred dollar desire

394
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,920
 yeah it's just the price point thing like even even the movies like yeah

395
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,000
 because because I'm not gonna see was advised by myself so I think that's like

396
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,700
 two hundred something dollars right right but it's still a hundred dollar day if I

397
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,960
 take the fam right sure so that's like it's just it just it just doesn't add up

398
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,520
 or whatever yeah our pal Lewis was looking out for me for a little while

399
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,960
 for first few years stuff that was popping up he runs that liquor

400
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,960
 distribution company all right okay but still the spheres tight tight ticket

401
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,040
 it's pricey it's a tight it's a tight ticket well it's a nine-inch nails ever

402
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,880
 plays a sphere that will prop that that could very well get me to Vegas they did

403
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,680
 right now Metallica the Metallica thing is like that's that but that's pretty

404
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,040
 great that's gonna be so much money so much money it'll be I think it's gonna

405
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,800
 be a lot of money and and but if I ever get the opportunity to I would go see

406
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,740
 the Metallica sphere that's for sure yeah are people making films of these

407
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,880
 concerts yes several of them yes okay I know there were films of the u2 one well

408
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,520
 I know see that's thing like Trent Reznor was working very closely with

409
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:05,320
 James Cameron at one point to put together a toured film and it just fell

410
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:11,620
 apart at the eleventh hour but I would love to love to see all that I still

411
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,520
 have I just realized I still haven't sat down and watched Ozzy Osbourne's last

412
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,640
 concert that that big huge concert they did shortly before he died that he

413
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,560
 actually performed at so two things from that you guys are really kind of

414
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,680
 contemplating or beat yourselves up for not seeing stuff it's really Kelly has

415
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,560
 turned into a scarecrow and Jack was just on TV talking about how the

416
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,440
 benefit money was way overinflated I guess they they had claimed like a

417
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,640
 hundred ninety million dollars or something like that remember Ozzy's

418
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,920
 concert yeah remember how giant time money that was supposed to be coming in

419
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,280
 I don't remember hearing anything about the money but I believe it yeah this

420
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,840
 latest interview Jack was like no it was like ten million dollars yeah it wasn't

421
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:07,100
 190 million dollars but then part of me goes oh wasn't it check oh really mr.

422
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:13,400
 runs the till yeah as far as I know we donated I don't think we got any money

423
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,360
 our way a lot of expenses here if somebody could reimburse me that'd be

424
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:28,160
 really great exactly exactly so I don't know yeah so my kill my kid will do that

425
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,800
 and then I'll go I should take all of the school to Metallica that's what I'll

426
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,160
 do good man that would be hip as shit well for your for your next kid's

427
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,680
 birthday you could have five of their friends show up Oh could learn to play

428
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,760
 all of the Metallica music on real instruments and then you could book the

429
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,600
 sphere for them to open for Metallica before Metallica sphere concert you

430
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,320
 could do that and then the next day you could throw a birthday party for your

431
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,280
 kids and wanted me to tell you Matt and wanted me to tell you I don't know if

432
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,820
 you know this map but there is a thing you could do for your kids and their

433
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,080
 friends relatively inexpensively if you wanted to show up like a boss Starbucks

434
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:19,040
 has just unveiled a mr. beast drink oh yeah that's you take our bucks you could

435
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,040
 take the kids to Starbucks for a mr. mr. beast pick me up I think that would be

436
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,560
 like number one on the kids list like if I if I if they could meet a celebrity I

437
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,320
 believe both my kids would choose mr. beast really really damn that's sad huh

438
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,360
 I know I started watching much less obtainable for them than audio guy for a

439
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:50,840
 podcast I yeah I mean they we just started watching beast games to the

440
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,360
 second alright of beast games came out this is admittedly not as

441
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,560
 psychologically torturous as the first season so far I've only watched the

442
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,560
 first two episodes lessons I learned this lawsuits have been settled not just

443
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,520
 a bunch of people being terrible right off the bat and just making everyone

444
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:14,560
 cry there's been a lot less tears in this first two seasons and actually much

445
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,660
 more of like competition stuff which is what you feel like legit things happen

446
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,600
 with winners and losers so I do think they've learned something from the first

447
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:28,120
 season like go to room one of you yeah psychological breakdown and then you

448
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:34,360
 lose it would have been difficult for them to how hard would it have been for

449
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,280
 them to just recreate that first season oh if you were just like do exactly the

450
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,400
 same thing here's the new people yeah you would have been like fuck no yeah I

451
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,640
 can't be if they did it again it'd be a felony no I thought it was so funny

452
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,360
 because he's he is remarkably not empathetic and he hosts like his his

453
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,560
 authentic reactions of what he laughs at or like what gets him like a little a

454
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,720
 little stirring is always like wow he just has no room for another human heart

455
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,520
 in there just not right in there and there's one game where they had to wear

456
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,320
 circles on the colored circles on the back of their head and there was

457
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,000
 different circle colors on the floor and within 10 seconds you had to run and be

458
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,320
 in the proper color okay that mass about your head so it means you had to ask the

459
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,920
 person next to you what colors in the back of your head or whatever it's a

460
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,520
 you quickly looked around to see who you had alliances with it would be truthful

461
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,240
 to you and in this particular round everyone was truthful with one another no

462
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,000
 one wanted to fuck anyone over oh nice and so everyone kept going to the proper

463
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,320
 colored circles and he kept being like if this is supposed to be a bluffing

464
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,800
 game and if no one plays the game then we have to find another way to live by

465
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,240
 people and you will not like it and he had to like admonish them for not

466
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,360
 fucking each other over and sure enough I did this is sort of drawing people at

467
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,560
 random and eliminating people because everyone's being truthful and even after

468
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,040
 the first rounds of that happening it never got the bluff game going they just

469
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,240
 eliminated people arbitrarily until it got down so that game was just people

470
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,000
 well you know that gives me a little hope that creeping fascism might have

471
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,520
 some speed bumps along the way oh no I think I think that is a I'm not even

472
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,760
 terribly surprised to hear it hear that honestly I've seen several things now

473
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,320
 like reality TV games I go down weird rabbit holes on these reality TV game

474
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,680
 shows especially foreign-made ones yeah and I just got done with a Korean one

475
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,560
 called something like the it translates to something like the devil's game yeah

476
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:48,240
 and it is not a well-made show but the game that they that they built to build

477
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,240
 to film the show around is a fascinating game and it was there were people who

478
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,000
 were doing kind of what you're talking about Matt there was one guy

479
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,200
 specifically he was like I'm gonna try and play this game where nobody gets

480
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,540
 eliminated until the final episode which I want to play this game where no one

481
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,320
 gets eliminated and we just play for the prize at the end and that's it Wow and

482
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,000
 it didn't work out that way but like he had real momentum going and just like

483
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,440
 kindness and working together is definitely something that is in the

484
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,920
 face of shitty people doing shitty things is definitely something that is

485
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,840
 making a resurgence I mean I think people recognize that it's a needed

486
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,360
 commodity and and they're filling a void I think yes and I mean it's a good point

487
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,240
 that should be represented in those kinds of more exciting or mainstream or

488
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,520
 attractive kind of media ways people are generally good good like like the

489
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,000
 problem yes the problem is that what makes the news is very right now we're

490
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,400
 living in an unprecedented era of blatant power grabs by very powerful

491
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,520
 people right right and it used to be that even the power grabbers would have

492
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,960
 to pretend to be altruistic or pretend to be you know caring in some way they

493
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,400
 had to do at least one press conference where it wasn't just about the oil right

494
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,960
 like could you imagine if you know as Elon Musk is winning court cases of

495
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,800
 anyone trying to be in the way of him becoming the most obscenely rich person

496
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,880
 on earth right he keeps winning these court cases and Tesla keeps battling to

497
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,320
 pay him the most amount of money possible and the thing that I find

498
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:29,320
 generally baffling if I were a major Tesla shareholder I would just be

499
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,760
 furious yeah all the time and it's this it's this tech bro like Messiah culture

500
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,760
 where they just make anyone who's come up with a good idea and got fucking

501
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,280
 really lucky yeah become the most you know worship person on earth and

502
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,160
 therefore these things can't exist without the worship person being a part

503
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,520
 of it right and it's really strange but could you imagine if he said hey if you

504
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,360
 if since everyone's making all this money I've decided to make dedicate

505
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,920
 blank of my income to go to these other things but he doesn't right I mean look

506
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,560
 there are plenty of examples of people who have you know like right Bloomberg

507
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,320
 Soros there are plenty of people who have made sure that Bill Gates has spent

508
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,840
 a lot of his money and influenced with altruistic endeavors so it's not it's

509
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,760
 not without examples that that exists but it's just not the culture it's a

510
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,560
 simply not the way it's it's going and so right now we have an era where very

511
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,440
 few people are being blatantly greedy for both money and power and going out

512
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,600
 of their way to affect people's lives that have nothing to do with it right

513
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,960
 and this is yeah that's a thing and those people are inviting other

514
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,800
 people's kids to come to these weirdly elaborate birthday parties for their

515
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,120
 kids it's not it's not free for the other parents I mean they have to do they

516
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,080
 have to spend the time and the money and everything and then they have to go do

517
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,760
 all these all these crazy tasks with their children the parent did offer to

518
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,840
 reimburse anyone for expenses for any supplies and beg them not to spend more

519
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,480
 than $20 so but it's interesting the thought did cross the mind obviously for

520
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:26,080
 that yes of course oh well I think the majority of people are still good and

521
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,240
 the majority people are empathetic and look out for each other and I do too and

522
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,480
 we see it with people putting the other resources like for example even the

523
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,320
 crazy-ass liver story that you told Paul millions of people did rally right like

524
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,160
 you know like yeah you know it's like we we do look out for people all the time

525
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,360
 did you see the doctor pepper thing I have a lot of friends in Minneapolis so

526
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,040

528
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,800
