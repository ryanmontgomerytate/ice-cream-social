1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you are here because it is time to thank you the ice cream

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
 truck drivers.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,080
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,040
 Right now I'd like to thank Jason Klepper, Jeff Harris, Jonathan, Lori Ellsworth, Leon

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,120
 Cassam, Malia, Mike, Paul's brother, and Pyro.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,840
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks, head over to preachingfun.com.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,600
 Where you can go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows, the life you save

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,520
 may be your own.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
 Just may be.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
 Boom.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
 A program.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
 Here we go.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Yeah I'd love to.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Great, let's go.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I also want to thank a ranch slug.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 We owe him a bunch of thank you.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 That's right, ranch slug.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm going to thank him at the top of the show.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Even though he's an ice cream truck driver.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,600
 Thank you ranch slug.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,520
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,160
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,160
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's Paul Mattingly.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,520
 Also sitting in Las Vegas, that's me and Jacob.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 We're preaching fun.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
 Hey everybody.

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,880
 I tell you what, I am preaching fun, but I accidentally just bummed myself out yesterday.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,920
 Oh no.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,520
 What did you do?

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
 Did you read the newspaper?

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,340
 Well, this is the thing, I don't listen to news podcasts anymore, I'll listen to Justin

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,840
 Robert Young when I feel like I can take it, when I feel like I'm okay.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
 It's absolutely, yeah.

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:55,600
 Because he tells it like it is and the way he's telling it, I don't like the way it is.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,560
 And the rest of the time, you normally just play myself with sports podcasts.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,280
 And right now, there's not a lot of sports happening.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,960
 And so I just go into the back catalog of Pablo Torre explains, what does it explains

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 at all?

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,960
 No, that's Clarissa.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,160
 I also always get Pablo Torre and Clarissa confused.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
 Yeah.

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
 Easy to do.

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
 Easy.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
 Yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
 Finds out.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
 Pablo Torre, Melissa Jonard.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,960
 And they're talking about this obscure statistician guy from the 80s is doing a deep dive and

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,040
 this guy who was kind of ahead of the sabermetrics thing before that became a thing, for anyone

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,440
 who doesn't know what we're talking about, it's like basically the nerds won breaking

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,600
 down baseball, then the nerds won breaking down basketball, and he was the first nerd

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,860
 to break down basketball.

53
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
 And he was...

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,800
 Is he the moneyball to basketball that the moneyball guy was to baseball?

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
 Correct.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,080
 The guy, Bill James, who started the moneyball craze, he was in the moneyball GM, but he

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,120
 was the guy who first started kind of breaking down baseball as a solid thing, anointed this

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,320
 guy whose name I'm forgetting as the-

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
 The moneyball basketball.

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
 Yeah.

61
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:16,560
 But that guy did not go on to have different success and basically, I guess, trigger warning,

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
 suicide.

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,560
 I don't know.

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
 Well, yeah.

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
 He didn't have depression.

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,760
 He didn't feel like he should have done something.

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,040
 He literally laid out an argument, like he laid out arguments for basketball players.

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,720
 He was a very laid out argumentous guy that he basically wanted to end his life specifically

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,540
 on his 60th birthday and just be done with it.

70
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,200
 And you say this bummed you out, huh?

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
 This super upbeat story somehow bummed you out?

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
 You've got like three years.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,920
 What are you worried about, man?

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,160
 And I'm thinking, I'm reading, I'm at the gym, I'm walking on my kid's soccer practice,

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,560
 I was reading about this obscure statistician and then it takes a turn and I'm sure there's

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
 a warning in the notes.

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,400
 I never read the episode notes.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
 Right.

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,440
 And so, but it was also fascinating, like he wrote all these emails to his family and

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,320
 put them to be sent hours after his death.

81
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
 He made sure-

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,880
 Oh, so he really set it all up.

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,280
 Yeah, he made sure to do it at the back parking lot of a police department so he could call

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,760
 911 so he could be an organ donor and no one who hadn't dealt with death would have to

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,080
 see him besides people who were in charge of doing that.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
 Wow.

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 It was this very crazy-

88
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 Intriguingly phone out.

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
 -consuming thing.

90
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 And it really-

92
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
 I'm inspired.

93
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,680
 I'm not depressed by this, I'm inspired by this.

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
 Pump the brakes.

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
 What's the scoop fest today, Jacob?

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
 Slow down.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 Slow your roll.

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 Oh, you are not helping your case, sir.

99
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
 I know.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,800
 I know.

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
 And I was like, oh man.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,320
 And then I was like, well, I'm going to get off, you know, I still had some walking to

103
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,600
 do at the soccer practice and so I was like, I'll switch over.

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,480
 And I decided to listen to two characters and a clown.

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,760
 Which one?

106
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
 The last one.

107
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,840
 Oh, it's over.

108
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
 Right.

109
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,280
 So I'm just going to tell you this, it is a fascinating one to listen to because when

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,480
 they start the episode, they don't know they're doing their last episode.

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 Really?

112
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
 Oh.

113
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 Yes.

114
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 It's that much of a thing, huh?

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 Oh, I had no idea.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 Right.

117
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,120
 It's not a bad blood thing, is it?

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
 No, it's fascinating.

119
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,080
 Again, another really fascinating thing about-

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,160
 It's just a mutual agreement that they're done.

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 Yes.

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,660
 But everybody's still amicable.

123
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
 Everybody's still friends.

124
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,520
 They're still working with each other backstage and still loving each other.

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,200
 What happens is you kind of listen to the episode and I knew that this was their last

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,040
 episode so it was fascinating to listen to it unfold.

127
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
 It was fascinating to hear them realize it.

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
 Yeah.

129
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,920
 So I knew it was their last episode, but I thought it was going to be them coming on

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,440
 air to talk about why they're going to do their last episode.

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,960
 And instead, I listened to 11 minutes of them talking about crab cakes and fish cakes and

132
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,720
 I'm like, "This is really weird."

133
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,000
 And then it's so clear that they have, and those who have to forgive me, I'm just going

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,640
 to talk about it, but it's so clear that there's a bunch of straws on the back of the Campbell,

135
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
 so to speak.

136
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
 Right?

137
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
 Oh.

138
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
 They're talking about how things are changing at work.

139
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,560
 They're talking about how things that they're dealing with at home.

140
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,320
 And then they talk about getting a complaint email from a listener.

141
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,280
 And then they kind of get into like, "I want to talk to you guys, but I don't want to talk

142
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,720
 about stuff on there.

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,600
 I don't want to worry about what I'm saying to you guys."

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:16,880
 And it is a fascinating listen because it's very clear Jimmy is the first one who's out.

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
 Right.

146
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 We realize it.

147
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
 Yeah.

148
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
 So for this, we have another podcast.

149
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
 It's two characters and a clown.

150
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,480
 It's three friends of ours.

151
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,120
 They all work backstage at a Cirque du Soleil show.

152
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,080
 They've been doing a podcast for three and a half years.

153
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
 And...

154
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
 Well, they all work on stage.

155
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,600
 They're all three performers at a Cirque du Soleil show.

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 Yeah.

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,360
 They're literally two characters in the show and a clown in the show.

158
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
 Yeah.

159
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
 Yeah.

160
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
 And you still have...

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
 If you're just giving us now, you have three and a half years of fine episodes.

162
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 Yeah.

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,600
 For instance, I just subscribed to it.

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,800
 I'm really looking forward to catching up.

165
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,880
 When there's a half hour left, maybe a little more, RJ makes a big dark night of the soul

166
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:08,680
 speech to Jimmy, really tries to get Jimmy to understand and feel his value, things like

167
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
 this.

168
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,880
 And Jimmy is having none of it, none of it.

169
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,440
 And that was hurting me, it was hurting to listen, you know?

170
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,400
 It does, it hurts to listen to that.

171
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,080
 I was like, "No, come on, buddy."

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
 He's telling Jimmy how valuable Jimmy is, and Jimmy's like, "Eh."

173
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 Yeah.

174
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 Okay.

175
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 And Jimmy's not buying it.

176
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
 Right.

177
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 What?

178
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
 Come on, Jimmy.

179
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
 Exactly.

180
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,080
 And then it's really funny because then Johnny just comes in, right, and starts talking.

181
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
 And I timed it.

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,160
 RJ doesn't speak for 25 minutes after his big speech, nothing.

183
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,960
 So I was like, "Oh, Johnny's the only one who thinks this is still a podcast right now."

184
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
 Oh, no.

185
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,720
 I think RJ knew on the big speech when it was just landing with nothing, he was like,

186
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 "No."

187
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 We're done.

188
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 We're done.

189
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
 And then...

190
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 Wow.

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,820
 And then so, you know, I mean, spoiler, it's a fast thing, listen, so I'm not even, I mean,

192
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,160
 it's all a spoiler, but it's all a fast thing.

193
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
 Listen.

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
 Listen anyway.

195
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,240
 RJ just goes back in and goes, "So why don't we just stop doing it?"

196
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,560
 Like right after he's not speaking at all, we're supposed to do it.

197
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,880
 Johnny is caught off guard?

198
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,080
 I don't think people realize, even RJ's friends, even me, I fall into this trap too.

199
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
 I forget what a thinker RJ is.

200
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
 Yes.

201
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,520
 So RJ will sit and think and ponder over something.

202
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,080
 And then when he comes back into the conversation, he's got it all straightened out.

203
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
 Totally.

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,960
 And you don't realize it for a minute or two.

205
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
 Yes.

206
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,880
 Big heart, big brain, that boy.

207
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 Of course.

208
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
 Just really loves his voice.

209
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,640
 And he literally just, he says, "Let's stop doing the podcast."

210
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,320
 On there, you can't hear, you know, it's an audio podcast.

211
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,980
 Johnny's struck and RJ goes, "Look how big the smile on Jimmy's face is."

212
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
 And Johnny does.

213
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
 It goes, "Oh, you're right.

214
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
 It's over."

215
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
 All right.

216
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
 Oh my God.

217
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,600
 And then, and I was like walking around my neighborhood, like I had to push pause to

218
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,320
 like make dinner for my kids.

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,040
 And I was like, "God damn it."

220
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,120
 I was like riveting.

221
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,200
 I was just like, crawling with discomfort for my friends and also like totally enthralled.

222
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,720
 And then I had to like table it for an hour and then go and finish it on a night walk.

223
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,240
 And I was just like, I was teary-eyed walking.

224
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:44,040
 I was like just, it was the most crazy podcast episode ever.

225
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,520
 Like, I couldn't believe it.

226
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,680
 I think it's hilarious that-

227
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,680
 I had honestly been saving it because, I was saving, it's the strong word, but I've been

228
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,840
 saving it because I was like, "Oh, they've got their last episode up.

229
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,560
 I've got a basic time to listen to it.

230
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,920
 Now I'm just fascinated."

231
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
 Yeah.

232
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,960
 I know because like, you know, we were lining them up for a trivia battle, right?

233
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,880
 And so that's when RJ let me know that it was like, "Oh, I don't think that's a good

234
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
 idea."

235
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 I was like, "What?"

236
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
 And same thing.

237
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 I was like, "Bad blood?

238
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 Anything?"

239
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, no."

240
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
 Huh?

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 Everybody's happy.

242
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,680
 And so it was just so clear that the choice to be a podcaster just wasn't what they wanted

243
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
 to do.

244
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 You know?

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,120
 It was a secondary choice.

246
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
 Well, that's it.

247
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,440
 They bring us up at the very end.

248
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,560
 They bring up this podcast at the very end and saying they don't want to become what

249
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
 we are.

250
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
 Right.

251
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,000
 They see our world as a burden.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,880
 Well, they also have real jobs.

253
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 That was the whole thing.

254
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,560
 I could like scream across my headphones.

255
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,560
 I was like, "You know, I, we, this podcast is what we are."

256
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 Yeah.

257
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
 Right.

258
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,920
 We weren't very successful guys doing something else.

259
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,960
 I thought we wanted to shed a little light.

260
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,640
 This is our successful thing and then we use this to bounce into other possibilities and

261
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 entrepreneurialism.

262
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
 Yeah.

263
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
 This is our Cirque du Soleil.

264
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
 This is our...

265
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
 Yeah.

266
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
 Yeah.

267
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
 This is what it is.

268
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 We're walking the tightrope right now, baby.

269
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,680
 This is the thing when we tell people about this thing, people go, "Ooh."

270
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 Exactly.

271
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
 Exactly.

272
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,000
 When they tell people about Cirque du Soleil, people go, "Ooh."

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Right.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
 We tell people about our little podcast and people are like, "Oh, that's very nice for

275
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 you guys."

276
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
 Yeah.

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
 No one goes up to them after their show.

278
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
 So it was like, "Should you guys podcast also?

279
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,240
 Because I really want more of you guys."

280
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,340
 So Scoop Jesus is saying Jacob was successful and that's true, but I think Jacob will also

281
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,960
 make the point that as successful as he is, and he is very good at his job and has a lot

282
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,880
 of success as a sound guy, he still gets a lot of interactions with fellow performers

283
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 who are like...

284
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
 This is a different thing.

285
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,520
 How do you make this podcast thing cook?

286
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
 How do you make...

287
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 Yeah.

288
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
 Yeah.

289
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
 This is a very different thing than what I do.

290
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,920
 And I'll tell you what, to Matt's point, and you're talking to the guys about doing the

291
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,540
 Cirque shows and then doing the podcasting stuff, I would be a very different podcaster

292
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,580
 if I didn't have a day job.

293
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,920
 Every time I talk about quitting running shows, SJ lets me have it.

294
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,600
 She's like, "What are you talking about?

295
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,080
 You're just going to podcast all the time.

296
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,360
 If you don't run shows, you're just going to podcast all the time.

297
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,720
 What are you going to talk about on these podcasts?"

298
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
 Right.

299
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
 It's true.

300
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
 It's true.

301
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 You got to have some external life before it comes in.

302
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
 Yeah.

303
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 Yeah.

304
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,560
 But this is a whole different thing from what I do.

305
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,760
 When I go and run a show, I sit back there, I'm executing somebody else's vision, I'm

306
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,320
 doing all these types of things, here, it's us.

307
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,200
 This is our thing.

308
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,480
 We get to do whatever we want on this because it's us.

309
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,360
 We also all three don't work with each other, right?

310
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,680
 I was going to say, we don't share a dressing room.

311
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
 Yeah.

312
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
 We get a break.

313
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,680
 No, but with that, the whole reason why I wanted to do the podcast with Paul in the

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:20,120
 first place was I was a dad and all I liked to do for my entire teens and twenties was

315
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
 bits.

316
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
 All I wanted to do was bits.

317
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,960
 All I wanted to do was bust balls and make jokes with friends.

318
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,520
 I knew that being a dad would make that go away a lot, not all the way, but a lot compared

319
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
 to what I was doing.

320
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
 Sure.

321
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,000
 I was like, "Oh, let's get in a space where we can make fun of stuff and do jokes."

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Good calls.

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Good call.

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,760
 It was definitely a big time branch for me, both personally and professionally, to get

325
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 this going.

326
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:01,640
 That's the thing, texting with RJ afterward, like, "Yeah, this is what podcasting is to

327
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,760
 me and you guys don't require any of it."

328
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
 Right.

329
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
 "You don't require any of it."

330
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,480
 So it was really interesting.

331
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,920
 I mean, because they do, all three of them share that dressing room, right?

332
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
 Yeah.

333
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 It was there?

334
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
 Yeah.

335
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
 Yeah.

336
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,600
 I don't know how we would do that.

337
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 I would say-

338
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,720
 I don't know, if we had a dressing room, if we saw each other off microphone and off camera

339
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,120
 all the time, I don't know how we'd still do a show.

340
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
 Totally.

341
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,960
 And especially if it gets like touch and go, whether we can talk about where we work together

342
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
 or not.

343
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
 Right.

344
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
 Right?

345
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
 Oh, yeah.

346
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
 That fluctuates.

347
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
 That's huge.

348
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,800
 And I would say that the- I think that maybe the toughest time for this podcast- actually

349
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,160
 the pandemic, second toughest time for this podcast was when Paul and I worked together.

350
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 Oh, sure.

351
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,160
 I think 50 Shades was probably the harder spot.

352
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
 Yeah.

353
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,200
 And it became the dominating talking point.

354
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,400
 We had to purposely branch off from that.

355
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 Yeah.

356
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 Yeah.

357
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
 Yeah.

358
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
 Yeah.

359
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 I mean, we literally butted heads.

360
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
 We're like, I didn't care about biting the hand that fed me.

361
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,080
 And Paul was like, this is a bad idea to bite the hand that feeds you.

362
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
 Well, yeah.

363
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 And-

364
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 And you were both right.

365
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
 Matt didn't care about it.

366
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 And Paul did.

367
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
 Yeah.

368
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
 And I shouldn't have.

369
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
 I shouldn't have given a fuck.

370
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
 Shouldn't have given a roaring fuck.

371
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,120
 But it's easy to say that when we're out of it.

372
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
 Yeah.

373
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,760
 It's easy to say we shouldn't have cared about something that we're no longer inside of.

374
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
 Yeah.

375
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 Yeah.

376
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
 Yeah, it is.

377
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
 It is.

378
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 It's like people.

379
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,480
 It's hard to say you don't care about people while you're inside of them.

380
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
 It is hard to say that.

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I've done my best.

382
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Yeah.

383
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,680
 And that's not the only time Paul did that.

384
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
 We did the Scoop Cruise.

385
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,120
 I was making fun of the opening show in the elevator.

386
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
 That's right.

387
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,640
 And our passengers got off the elevator and Paul let me have it.

388
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,440
 And by the way, that was very helpful.

389
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,320
 Paul was like, do not talk shit about anything.

390
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,840
 Everyone reports everything to everyone on cruise ships.

391
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
 Everybody has ears.

392
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,320
 You cannot, as an entertainer, talk shit.

393
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,840
 He was right then, even though my pride didn't want him to be.

394
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
 And now I-

395
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,880
 I don't think I was too mean about it.

396
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,720
 You were not-

397
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,960
 I was probably serious about it.

398
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,920
 You were very serious and very direct about it.

399
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
 You were not-

400
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
 You were direct about it.

401
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,640
 I wouldn't say you were mean about it, but you were direct about it.

402
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
 Yeah.

403
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,600
 Well, because I'd done nine months on a cruise ship.

404
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 Yeah, yeah.

405
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 You were just real about it.

406
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
 You were just real about it.

407
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 Live that fucking life, baby.

408
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
 Yeah.

409
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,880
 Well, in some sense, that moment turned out to be very key to what I'm doing now.

410
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
 There you go.

411
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,200
 So I'm not saying you were wrong in any way.

412
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,520
 I'm saying in hindsight, I was like, boy, not only were you right then, but I'm even

413
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,800
 more grateful now.

414
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,120
 I go on cruise ships like everything is bumped.

415
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
 Exactly.

416
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
 And it is.

417
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
 Because it is.

418
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
 Because it is.

419
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
 It fucking is.

420
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
 I mean, seriously.

421
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,760
 They need the fucking organ man.

422
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,880
 You go to enough ports where everyone's toting machine guns and you get a little sense in

423
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,520
 your mind like, oh, there could be some shit going down.

424
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,560
 I bet people are really looking out for stuff.

425
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
 Yes.

426
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
 You know what I mean?

427
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,240
 Like, you know, yeah, you go to enough places where you're like, oh, there's some serious

428
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,800
 military hardware like back in these ports.

429
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,240
 They're not going to they're not going to let games get played.

430
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
 Yeah.

431
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
 Yeah.

432
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
 Yeah.

433
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
 Yeah.

434
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,880
 I'll tell you who doesn't let games get played in their ports.

435
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,480
 And that is the following sponsor today's show.

436
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 I don't believe it.

437
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 Today's show.

438
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 The show.

439
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
 The show.

440
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,120
 I don't think anything any time soon is brought to you.

441
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
 No, they didn't think it was either.

442
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:50,760
 Matt and Mattingly's Meet the Wolfman Act Four Scene Three, Matt escapes the wolf man

443
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,840
 by prepping him to perform Unfool Us from Scoop John C.

444
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,760
 We now take you to Act Four Scene Three of Matt and Mattingly Meet the Wolfman.

445
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:11,680
 Arr. Yes. Arr. Great job, Wolfman. Love the pizzazz. You have to get that giant, dirty,

446
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,320
 thick fingernail underneath two cards, but then at the top of the deck, then hold it

447
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
 as one.

448
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,720
 You're going to lift it up. Oh, man, I'm trying. These paws ain't cooperating. I know. You're

449
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,080
 doing very good. It's just called a double lift. You're going to lift up both cards and

450
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
 show it to the audience like one.

451
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,360
 What do you say we rearrange my appointment time for a full moon and I could just do my

452
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,880
 straight transformation routine?

453
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,960
 The problem is Lincoln at Fool's likes to bump people around depending on the schedule

454
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,600
 and your local so he knows he can bump you around. So you're not going to get the spot

455
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,560
 that we can't rely on that spot.

456
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,120
 I get it. I get it. But I mean, I'm a rare reverse werewolf. I'm Wolfman all the time

457
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,800
 except during a full moon. Well, I understand. I understand. Well, let me just rehearse some

458
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,280
 of the lines like so so Penn and Teller, did I fool you? You want to try that one? So Penn

459
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:22,560
 and Teller, did I fool you. OK, I think the fool is a little long. Oh, I've been going

460
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:33,200
 to speech therapy for a long time and it just don't take. Yeah. Yeah. No, I understand.

461
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,800
 I understand. I think you got a rabbit I could eat. That's the one out of your hat. Yeah,

462
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,060
 come on. Stereotype my ass. That's why I got in the biz room. Oh, did you win your

463
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,840
 team's high school basketball championship while we're doing we're doing stereotypes

464
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,180
 back and forth? Did you come here on top of your friend's van? Just because my best friend

465
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:07,520
 happens to be named Stiles. Very common. Teen Wolf references for modern audiences. Is there

466
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,280
 a young lady named Booth that has some of your attention, but not as much as it should?

467
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:21,520
 Booth. I can't believe her name was Booth. Wait, Wolfman, what was her name? Booth. And

468
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:31,760
 her hate scoops at checkout. Oh, Lord. Oh my God. Remember proposing that we should just

469
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,280
 end the show at episode one thousand. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And that bothered Paul a lot when

470
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:45,280
 I even just well, I quickly fixed it and said, no, that's the beginning of season two. We're

471
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,560
 off to the races. Oh, I saved myself for another thousand episodes. But who knows, season two

472
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,120
 might be the last season. It might be the season one might have been the penultimate

473
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,600
 season. We're going into third season here. Well, we don't know how long season two might

474
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,880
 be. Oh, well, I mean, it's going to be a thousand episodes at least. At least. I guess we know

475
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,160
 a season is at least a thousand episodes. Maybe for for for a bit sake, it's a thousand

476
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,040
 and one and then season season three starts on one thousand two. Oh, I explained to a

477
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,960
 friend the other day that they asked about a friend of mine was asking about podcast

478
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,920
 season. We're going to remember that note for seven years. But yes, keep keep going.

479
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,000
 I'll remember that easily. We need at least seven seasons, says Bossy. I will be dead

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,300
 by season seven. So that's going to be tough. That's going to be tough. Not to say someone

481
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:41,420
 couldn't pick this ball up. It's going to be my children and all of your dogs. My dogs

482
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,900
 will be long dead before that. You won't get it. Whatever incarnation of whatever, whatever

483
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,560
 sled dog thing you currently are adopting or fostering. Oh, my God, you're right. It's

484
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,880
 never going to stop. Yeah. So speaking of my dogs and talking to Matt's kids, the reason

485
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,220
 I was a little bit behind today was we're working with a contractor who their mascot

486
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,320
 is a little corgi dog in a hard hat. So it's really cute. So that helped get all right.

487
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,960
 All right. Let's say let's say percentage. Give me a percentage. How much of a percentage

488
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,800
 of of of you selecting this contractor had to do with that image? Oh, 80 percent easily.

489
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,760
 Good. OK, because because that was part of it. And Ann sent me that link and everything.

490
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,560
 And we we saw that. So we're like, yeah, like we're going to go. So yeah, it was really,

491
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,240
 you know, they know their market. Yeah. These are exterior house painters. And what do you

492
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,200
 call it? And so Ann had been looking to get some work done on the exterior of the house

493
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:48,360
 for a long time. And she's already had, you know, ideas sent out to professional planescapers

494
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,240
 that can make it look like, you know, how they want. And so she's got all the great

495
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,420
 the paint ideas set, everything set. And we got finally a consultation today. They had

496
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,680
 to move their time back a little bit just because they were super busy. But we're supposed

497
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,040
 to be meeting at noon. We ended up meeting closer to one. So that's why I got pushed

498
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,240
 back a little bit time wise. But looks like everything's going to move forward. And hopefully

499
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,120
 by October, we're going to have new exterior colors and things done. And also the big thing,

500
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,760
 the brickwork, the brickwork, which I might add, that allowed for the entrance of one

501
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:32,200
 squirrel into my basement. So the so the lack of brickwork, the lack of brickwork. So we're

502
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,960
 going to get that all touched up. They can do that as well. So we're going to get that

503
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,360
 all patched up. And they're going to do this process called lime washing cutting the brakes

504
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,480
 in that truck. They absolutely are. They want in. But we're going to get it limed washed

505
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,400
 and it's going to look really nice. So the brick, the brickwork is going to get touched

506
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,520
 up, masoned in, fixed up. And what's the line washing do? It makes it look white. Okay,

507
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,120
 instead of, you know, different shades of white instead of the regular brick color that

508
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,240
 we have right now. Oh, so it's what it makes it lighten up. Okay, exactly. Some of it is

509
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,840
 kind of like falling apart. There is a piece of brick missing from the very front of our

510
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,060
 house where it's really close to a vent for the air conditioning system. And I could look

511
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:29,340
 in that vent and I could see outside of my house. And so I was like, okay, so currently

512
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,220
 well, that's the vent, the Mattingly fix that's going on for that piece of brickwork right

513
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:41,920
 now is a big goopy chunk of great stuff. I scored it into the wall. So you've got all

514
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:49,160
 this brick and then this hunk of yellow nasty just get off the side, but you can't get back

515
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,120
 into the towel. I would have suggested just shoving a towel. No, it wouldn't have a towel

516
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,440
 wouldn't have worked. It wasn't that big of a gap, but it was big enough. Okay. The great

517
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,140
 stuff worked. So there you go. Uh, yeah. Yes. I know ranch slunk. You can't paint, uh, exactly.

518
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,120
 So the lime wash allows this. Look at that. Perfect. Ranch slunk coming through with the

519
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,400
 info. Ranch slunk in the chat says, uh, brick should not be painted as it needs to breathe.

520
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,880
 Lime wash allows for this so that it does not crumble due to weathering. Exactly. Uh,

521
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,880
 gosh, that's a big shame because all of the brick on the, on my house is all painted.

522
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,960
 We finally gave him his thank you. And then he's coming off everywhere with these facts.

523
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,240
 It's pretty great. I know. Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, Jacob, your brickwork

524
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,560
 is probably safe given the environment that it's in. I don't have any, there's no moisture

525
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,580
 getting exactly. It's so bone dry. It's not going to be a thing, but he was just telling

526
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:45,320
 us about a painted brick situation that they're dealing with on another home. They spent four

527
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,800
 days trying to get the paint, working to get the paint off so the brick can get worked

528
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,960
 on again. So it's just a nightmare if you actually do paint your bricks incorrectly.

529
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,680
 So we knew about that. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I have painted bricks, but maybe, maybe

530
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,800
 the dryness will save me in my house. I think that's it. And it's also, it's also probably

531
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,640
 depends on the mixture of the brick and what kind of, like, these are like straight up

532
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:16,520
 bricky bricks. Are yours more like, uh, non-bricky bricks? I'm fascinated where this question

533
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,720
 is about to go. I am so curious. Number one, Las Vegas masonry podcast. Let's roll. I don't,

534
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,360
 I just kind of believe there are different kinds of compositions of the masonry. I am

535
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,960
 so curious what Paul, what knowledge of bricks Paul is about to reveal and what level of

536
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,200
 brick knowledge he thinks that I have. Are they grade A bricks? Are they grade B? So

537
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,440
 I'm looking for to get some work done on my bricks. Now these are bricky bricks, you'll

538
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,960
 know. Brickety bricks. Yeah, these are brickety brick brick bricks. These ones have the same

539
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:59,640
 intelligence as a U.S. Senator. Oh my, well, brickety brick. Everything about our, our

540
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:07,200
 house is 1980. The house looks like the Ford Tempo that we used to own. If we still had

541
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,200
 that Ford Tempo, it would, you could park the Ford Tempo we used to have right next

542
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,040
 to our house and it would disappear like camouflage. You know how, uh, the, the enterprise D has

543
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,600
 that beige and, and, uh, wood. Sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, Matt and I were just talking about

544
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,760
 that earlier. The enterprise D with the beige-ness. The different browns and tans. Extra dick.

545
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:40,560
 The different browns and tans. So it was a Ford Tempo from 80, 82 maybe. It was a Brown

546
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:50,040
 Ford Tempo from 82. Uh, I think Brown Ford, yeah, around 82 or 84. Uh, 84. Go 84. It needs

547
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,960
 to be a little bit newer than that then. I love, okay. So we're, we're, for those of

548
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,920
 you listening, we're building up the, uh, the pictures here, uh, of a Brown Ford Tempo

549
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,400
 from 80. Oh yeah. That's, that's good and brown. Yeah. It was just like your house.

550
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,240
 It was two-tone though. Like it had, the top of it was, was light beige and the bottom

551
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,480
 was dark beige and then the seats were beige. It was just the beige-iest fucking thing and

552
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,960
 our house is just beige. You got a beige house. The crazy thing about it too, they just replaced

553
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:31,520
 the windows before we moved in. She's mighty bland. Boring as all get out. She's a beige

554
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,840
 house. No curb appeal at all. Just making you forget it exists. Uh, yeah. It is, I mean,

555
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,160
 for me personally, I could give a shit what the exterior of the house looks like because

556
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,960
 I've made the interior look like, at least my basement, a vomit of color and craziness.

557
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,880
 You know what I mean? It's, it's, it's nuts down here. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's special.

558
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,080
 I love it. I love it down here. It's crazy. Uh, it makes me happy. Um, and it, and it

559
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,440
 is very, a very nondescript home. Like if you were looking for like a place to just

560
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,240
 hide forever, this would be it, but, uh, it's going to be this beautiful cottage blue and

561
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,320
 whites, but they, when they put the new windows in on the house, the windows that they got

562
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,760
 had a green interior trim that was just part of the, the build, like the, it's metal green

563
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,080
 and it just looks wackadoos. Anyway, we're getting everything fixed up and it's going

564
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,600
 to be really lovely. And the fact that this company can fix them windows, the fact that

565
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,400
 this company can fix the brick as well makes me really happy because like I said, some

566
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,000
 of it's being held together with great stuff. So there you go. Yeah. Well, squirrels are

567
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,360
 being held out with, with great stuff. Yes. Yeah. Great stuff. Single-handedly keeping

568
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,160
 squirrels out of the Mattingly household. It's keeping something out. It's keeping some

569
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,960
 stuff out. Yeah. Uh, latter day scoop says my basement is the suburb equivalent of stabbing

570
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,560
 a person in the attic just to see color. I, I, or the Arctic just to see color. Oh yes.

571
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,880
 Okay. Yes. Then that makes more sense. Uh, yeah, kind of, kind of. Yeah. I drive along.

572
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,440
 I pull up to my every time I go up into my attic, I go completely colorblind. It's terrible.

573
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,160
 I do pull up to my very nondescript drive and then I opened the basement door and then

574
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,640
 just hit with a flood of color. And also in the chat, can a clumsy knows what's up because

575
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,720
 that dog ain't no dog. That's three squirrels in a dog costume. It's a heist. Oh yeah. It's

576
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,600
 a heist. It's a heist. Could be, could be. If only we could get in, but there's so much

577
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,920
 great stuff. I'm seeing some, some faces in the chat here that they're going to get thank

578
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,920
 you videos of from my son. Uh, uh, uh, but, uh, it's that time of year for my son makes

579
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,520
 adorable thank you videos. If you donate to him this year, the theme is, uh, if he wins

580
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,120
 his donation contest, he gets a big annoying beach ball. That'll be in the house and annoy

581
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,520
 his mother. So he's putting out videos. This has helped me annoy my mom and you can donate

582
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,840
 to it and scoops party stepped up. But, uh, but, but, but do, do step up and, uh, and,

583
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,160
 and if you want up, up, the link is on my Instagram. If you go to my noodler and click

584
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,800
 on my links, it says donate to my kid's school, but you can see the, uh, it's weirdly not

585
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,520
 on your wife's social media at all. It's almost like she doesn't want it to happen. So, uh,

586
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,000
 public schools still need a little extra funding. Believe it or not. Yeah. No, I don't. I can't,

587
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:31,080
 I can't imagine. You kid me. He is, he is like 150 bucks out of the top 10. So, uh,

588
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,480
 he's close to getting some real, real recognition there. That's fantastic. Good for him. Does

589
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,120
 he get a prize? If he, if he finishes in the top 10, I think he has an extra like some,

590
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,720
 I don't know, some doodad bullshit sticker. Get some graduate eighth grade. Yeah. Look,

591
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 they'll, they'll make him stand up at the graduation or something. Yeah. Ooh. Spirit

592
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,400
 of the funding drive. Let's go. Spirit of the candy bars. Spirit of the candy bars,

593
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,880
 man. That's, I am the spirit of the candy bars. Woo. Spirit of the funding drive. Uh,

594
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,600
 I, Jacob, bring our buddy, Jobbeth in here for a minute here. Oh, that's fine. Jobbeth

595
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,160
 in here? Yeah. Well, you go ahead and talk and I'll bring you up. Jobbeth is, uh, going

596
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:19,040
 to take his show to Spain. And so he's trying to, uh, crowdfund that effort. And, uh, he,

597
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,200
 he was, he reached out to me to say, if you could talk about the show, I said, yes, but

598
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,840
 I also wanted to come up with something for the scoops to put on his Kickstarter. And

599
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,760
 so, uh, he, he, uh, he's going to announce what that, what that is. Um, when you find

600
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,800
 him, Jacob, Jesus, Jobbeth, start talking. I can't find him. Oh, you need me to start

601
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,120
 talking so you can find me. I'm sorry. I thought Matt just picked up on it and started running

602
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,600
 with it. Oh no, I wanted both of you. Oh, there you are. I found you. Awesome. So yeah,

603
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,760
 I, um, producing. I was like, I can't find him in the fucking zoom thing. I don't know.

604
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,000
 From times being in the churn and otherwise, uh, past handful of years, I have kind of

605
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,100
 shifted lanes a little bit into doing hypnosis shows instead of the normal mentalism that

606
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,760
 I was doing before. And it's, it's kind of really blown up and it's taken me all over

607
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,080
 the place. So yeah, I got an invitation to go and participate in this year's 2025 Barcelona

608
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,120
 fringe festival in Barcelona, Spain, which is exciting. And we're, uh, I'm dragging

609
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,440
 my wife along. We're making a big adventure out of it. So we're going to end up hitting

610
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,200
 a couple different European countries on the way there. Um, but I'm looking to really build

611
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,440
 exposure with this thing. So the, the purpose of the Kickstarter, they all look like they're

612
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,040
 there to raise money, which is, which is great. And there's some fun perks. And we'll talk

613
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,640
 about some of those that per Matt's suggestion, which I think is fantastic. And I would love

614
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:56,120
 to do, um, some specific add-ons for the scoops really. I'm trying to get this thing to hit.

615
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:02,380
 So it, you know, it triggers the algorithm and I get more of a global exposure for this

616
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,720
 thing because it's, if anybody's ever performed at a fringe festival, I know that some of

617
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,200
 the scoops have, and I think, I mean, Matt, you did the one in, uh, fallout fringe. It's

618
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,840
 one of the best investments that artists can make. It's just, it's just, it's just a license

619
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,640
 to print money. It really is, uh, you had a decidedly different experience than, than

620
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:30,240
 I did. Um, almost every fringe festival in the language is like, Hey, we will not let

621
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,440
 you make a profit. Like it's almost guaranteed. So like you can, you can ask to break even

622
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:44,160
 at best. There's usually language in the application that says that. So before I decided to launch

623
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,140
 this Kickstarter, I talked to my wife into coming with me and I said exactly that in

624
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,720
 some version of that. I said there's the best that you can hope to do is break even. We're

625
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,840
 going to make a vacation out of this that I happen to be doing a run of shows that way.

626
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,480
 Nobody's mad about the money, but I want the exposure. I want full rooms. My shows are

627
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,720
 far more fun with a lot more people in the room. And it's a really different type of

628
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,300
 show because usually hypnotists, they do their thing, bring people up, get whoever they can

629
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,960
 into trance. And then they've got this script of routines that they go through of the silly

630
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,880
 shit that they make people do. I am doing a show where as audience members enter the

631
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,680
 theater, they are prompted to put down ideas for stuff that they want to see in the show.

632
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,000
 And I'm going to write the show basically on the fly. Um, there, there's going to be

633
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,600
 some cheating involved with respect to the Kickstarter. So if you are interested in the

634
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,720
 Kickstarter, no, I thought you meant you were going to fuck other people's spouses. Um,

635
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:53,360
 just right there on stage. If they wrote on the paper, they wrote it on the paper. Fuck

636
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,280
 my wife. The Kickstarter will give people a chance to suggest routines that I'll bring

637
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,360
 with me and drop into the bucket as potential things. So ultimately again, I want these

638
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,620
 full room, the full rooms. One of my real call to action here is less about funding

639
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,760
 the Kickstarter more about, cause right now it's in pre-launch. Okay. Uh, everything is

640
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,360
 at carnival of dreams.com. So that's the name of the show. Um, and again, the, the

641
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,800
 audience, I'll throw that in the zoom chat for people who were there. If people can jump

642
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,640
 on and follow this thing, because the, the follows that you get in pre-launch are also

643
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,560
 part of triggering the algorithm and getting it exposure. Um, I'm trying to put as much

644
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,040
 of the full court press on this thing as I can. Thank you, Jacob. Um, and, but there

645
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,000
 is some cool stuff. So for as little as five bucks, people can join a private WhatsApp

646
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,380
 group where I'm going to be giving updates throughout and everything up to getting swag

647
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:00,760
 from it, suggesting routines. Um, everything's got a price. So if you want it to be guaranteed

648
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,440
 that I use your routine in a show, there is a level where you and I will hop on the zoom

649
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,160
 call before this thing and actually plan out and write a routine. Uh, so you know what

650
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,640
 you're getting. I video all the shows. So there's one of the levels that you can get

651
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,200
 video of all of the shows from it. And for the scoops, since I'm going to be in Europe

652
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,800
 and in three European cities, there will be an ad on there that will make sense to almost

653
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:33,620
 nobody other than you all, where I will yell salt pork in front of some sort of famous

654
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:41,720
 monument somewhere in either Paris or Barcelona. And, you know, you don't even have to put

655
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,200
 hay scoops at checkout. You'll know exactly what it is. It actually even says that you

656
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
 don't have to put hay scoops at checkout. I don't even know if there's promo codes on

657
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:56,120
 it. I've backed so many damn projects, whether they are magic related or other weird tech

658
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:02,240
 stuff and like the number of decks of playing cards that I have that Sean Farquhar has designed.

659
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,760
 I could probably build a house with them. But yeah, I'm sure you shoot it with the foam

660
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,100
 that Paul used to keep the mice out of the basement. Right. A little great stuff goes

661
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:21,840
 a long way. Otherwise, three squirrels and a trench coat will steal it.

662
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,160
 So I thought it was really funny to have Jobeth yelling salt pork out loud at different monuments

663
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,800
 and stuff around Europe. Oh wait, are you going to yell salt pork in front of the monuments

664
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,560
 or are you going to yell salt pork at the monuments? As though the monuments have done

665
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,360
 something to deserve being yelled at. Dealers choice. And for anybody who's back

666
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,520
 to Kickstarter before, you know that once it funds, once you get the submission and

667
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,760
 everything, there'll be some back and forth. And you know, I've been a member of this community

668
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,120
 since I brought Matt to Elkton to really kick off us having the Elkton magic shows. And

669
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:08,800
 I kind of backdoor obelisk myself because of wanting to do some research. For a second,

670
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,240
 I thought you were going to tell a fun story about you and Matt in the early days. Hello.

671
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,840
 I mean, there's plenty of plenty of fun stories. It's very similar to Wolfman's appearance

672
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:28,160
 on foolish. Very similar. So, you know, the scopes, I don't know that I feel like I quote

673
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,240
 a lot to them, but I certainly owe a lot of enjoyment to everything that is here. So the

674
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,320
 amount of levity that's going to exist in you sending me a message saying, can you do

675
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:44,040
 specifically this consider it done? Again, the following joke was I came up with an idea

676
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,320
 for Africa Babel and maybe other people on here might like that one too. Okay. Same thing.

677
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,120
 Only you hold up a Rubik's cube and you go, you know, there's one in 43 quadrillion combinations

678
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,040
 of things on a Rubik's cube. Did you know that? And then I'll pan to my wife and she

679
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:10,240
 can do RJ's sigh. So for those listening, it's my biggest pet peeve with every magician

680
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,600
 has dumb pet peeves. And mine is that anytime anyone does a Rubik's cube trick, they say

681
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,480
 there are over 43 quadrillion combinations you can do with Rubik's cube. And I just think

682
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,160
 like that's true. I agree. But do you want me, the audience member to think that you,

683
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,200
 the magician knows 43 quadrillion combinations because that's obnoxious. That's obnoxious.

684
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,000
 You want me to think you're that much of a math whiz, but also, you know, are going to

685
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,360
 find my eight of hearts later. Like it just seems like a really weird thing to add to

686
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,920
 a show. You are the smartest person I've ever seen and you're doing Rubik's cube magic.

687
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:57,160
 Exactly. Exactly. Perfect job. I've got a question for you. The shows in Spain, are

688
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,920
 they going to be done in English or are you learning them in Spanish? They are going to

689
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:10,040
 be done in English. So that area in Barcelona apparently has a thriving English comedy scene,

690
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,800
 which is, which was what became the birth of this fringe festival there. This is the

691
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,380
 second year that they've done it. So I'm sure that I'm going to have some Spanish speaking

692
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:27,360
 or bilingual or, or folks who speak Catalan because it's in that region. I took five years

693
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,380
 of Spanish in high school and I'm surprised as I'm 60 couple days into a Duolingo streak,

694
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:47,160
 not much I both remember and forget from that time. Gracias. De nada. Perfect. Oh, you're

695
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:55,000
 ready man. I'm going to order cerveza, all that I want. I will have no problem finding

696
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,120
 the baguio. I'll be able to find the library. Yup. La biblioteca. Muy bien. You're so fast

697
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:08,920
 on that day. Nada, you're ready. You're ready to be there. Anything else people need to

698
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,280
 look for? What's that? Anything else people need to look for? Carnival of dreams, carnival

699
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,360
 of dreams dot com over time. That is going to evolve to just go to the Kickstarter site

700
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,280
 and then when Kickstarter is done, it's going to be ticket links. So if anybody's actually,

701
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,800
 I don't know if you guys have scoops that are specifically in Barcelona or if you happen

702
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,520
 to be there, if you're a scoop, reach out. I'll comp you tickets because obviously we've

703
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,800
 already written off any profit from this thing. And I'd love to have butts in seats. We've

704
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,640
 accepted that we're not going to make money. We might as well lean into it. Let's get the

705
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,680
 butts in the seats. Exactly. Oh, awesome. I like it. Cool. Hey, thank you for giving

706
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,080
 me a little time and thank you for putting enough time between the recap of two characters

707
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,520
 in a clown RIP while you were going through all of that. I'm sitting here, I don't want

708
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,760
 to follow this. I hope he doesn't put me on right after. Well, luckily everybody had forgotten

709
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,360
 about it until you brought it back. Oh, now we're all sad. I'm here to self-sabotage myself

710
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:20,360
 any way I can. Thanks, buddy. I'm following you on the Kickstarter. Looks good. Beautiful.

711
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,840
 All you have to do, go over there to that website that we said earlier that someone

712
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,720
 will repeat now that I've forgotten what it was called. Carnival of dreams dot com. Go

713
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,920
 over there. All you have to do is sign into your Kickstarter and follow it on right there

714
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,120
 and it will alert you when the Kickstarter goes active and you'll be helping Joe without

715
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,600
 to go over there. Carnival of dreams. Do that right now, especially if you're sitting there

716
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,560
 watching us on zoom. You can just go over there on your device and do it. It's right

717
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,400
 here. You're right there. It's right here. You're already here, buddy. You're already

718
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,640
 here. I'll tell you who else is already here and will probably be performing at oh, shit.

719
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:05,000
 I just muted Matt. Sorry, Matt. I just muted you on your zoom. Sorry. That was a not too

720
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,840
 subtle hint. I understand. I'll check myself. I forgot what I was going to say. Following

721
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:23,880
 the answer. Disco daycare. That's right. I heard somebody say disco daycare. Tonight.

722
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:47,880
 Tonight. Tonight. I'm watching you, baby. Tonight. I'm watching you, baby. Tonight.

723
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:58,320
 I'm watching you, baby. Walk around. Making sure you, baby, stay safe. Watching you, baby.

724
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:12,480
 Don't drown. Tonight. Tonight. I'm watching you, baby. Tonight. It must be real cheap

725
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,680
 with the zoom delay. There's not a single chance I'm ending this. This is the rest of

726
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:34,360
 the show. Tonight. I'm watching you, baby. Tonight. Yeah, I'm watching you, baby. Making

727
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,720
 sure that your baby gets fed. Making sure that it gets into bed. Get some sleep. Get

728
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:54,840
 a nap. Get a snack. I'm watching you, baby. Watching you, baby. Tonight. Why is my baby

729
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,880
 doing cocaine in the bathroom? Look, I'm watching your baby as much as I can. I can't watch

730
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,120
 him all the time. And I can't go into the bathroom with the baby. That's against federal

731
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:17,560
 law. Daddy, I need more cocaine. Don't we all. Tonight. I'm watching you, baby. Snug

732
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:26,880
 coke. Off the back of a urinal. Tonight. Not even off a mirror. Off the urinal. Off the

733
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,800
 back of a urinal. The baby's not that tall. Oh, man. It's using the short urinal, the

734
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:49,440
 baby urinal. Better hay scoops to check out. Doing cocaine off the baby urinal. Oh, Lord.

735
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,520
 I went and saw Clue on the big screen last night. Oh, yeah. That's out in theaters, right?

736
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,800
 They were playing it at the South Point here in Las Vegas. I went and saw Tim Curry and

737
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:06,480
 Martin Maul do Clue. Flames. Flames at the side of my face. Madeline Khan, when she enters

738
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,000
 the movie for the first time, I started laughing instantly. Holy shit. I love Madeline Khan

739
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,880
 so much. She's so good in that movie. So good. So tell me. And they did the thing. They did

740
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,000
 the thing, like the original one, where they didn't show all the endings. Oh, they just

741
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,200
 showed one. OK. They picked one ending and showed that. Yeah. Yeah, because that's how

742
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,400
 they did it when the movie first came out, I guess. That's right. To show all the different

743
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,760
 theaters had just one ending. I think Comedy Central started... I think they're the ones

744
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,640
 who did all the endings together. When Comedy Central started re-airing the movie. I think

745
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,600
 they did it on the VHS. The VHS release had all the endings. Oh, is that what it is? Yeah.

746
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,040
 The VHS went, "And maybe it went like this. And maybe it went like this." Oh, so Comedy

747
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:58,040
 Central showed that part. Yes. And I think that kind of inspired Wayne's World. Oh, yeah,

748
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,400
 that makes sense. First Wayne's World had multiple endings. But yeah, it was so good.

749
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:10,600
 Matt, what were you going to ask? I forget now. Oh, cool. Nailed it. Yeah, it was great.

750
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:17,480
 I love watching those. I'm no longer a good podcaster. I quit. But I have fish cakes.

751
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,120
 Oh, never mind. I'm back in. Oh, good. Urinal fish cakes. They got to hold one podcast together.

752
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:32,760
 Urinal fish cakes. Urinal fish cakes. Yuck. Gross. There was a group behind me who was

753
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:40,680
 just saying out loud every single punchline before it happened. Oh, that's so annoying.

754
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,600
 It didn't bother me that much because I knew all of them too. So I was also... I was like,

755
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,800
 "Oh, these are coming." Do you think this is an effect of it being a Tim Curry movie

756
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:57,920
 and they're kind of just vibing on that Rocky vibe? Yeah. I think so. I think they were

757
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,140
 just having a good time. I wasn't mad at them, but they were doing a lot. I was also sitting

758
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,680
 next to a... I don't know. You know me. I can't tell how old kids are, but it was a

759
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,800
 little girl. She seemed to be like, I don't know, 12 maybe, 12, 13, something like that.

760
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:21,000
 And it is really great sitting next to someone at a movie that you love. And as you're watching

761
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,800
 it, you realize how formative it was to you, especially to your comedy as you're watching

762
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:37,200
 it. And you're sitting next to a preteen little girl who is so unimpressed with everything.

763
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:46,040
 The screen might as well be blank. Wow. It was so great. It made my night. This kid doesn't

764
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:52,000
 give a shit about this at all. Just hated it. Just hated it. Really? It was like just

765
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,120
 sitting there. You could tell every reference to it because it's a more dated movie than

766
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,200
 you think it is. There are a few references in there that you're like... If you don't

767
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:09,600
 know what... Hoover is on the phone at one point. J. Edgar Hoover is on the phone at

768
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,160
 one point. And somebody makes the comment, Tim Curry makes the comment, he's like, "He's

769
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,360
 on everybody else's phone. Why shouldn't he be on mine?" Right, right, right, right.

770
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,680
 You're like, "Oh, that's a funny J. Edgar Hoover running the FBI joke that is not applicable

771
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:31,600
 in 2025 at all." Now, how old is this individual? Oh, the kid was like 12 or 13. Oh, okay. So

772
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,560
 yeah, no, no, no. I was like, "Why did your parents bring you to this? You clearly hate

773
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:44,240
 all of this." Well, and it's also just a factor of movies were a little bit more slow paced

774
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,560
 back in the day. A little slower. Yeah. So, you know, that's hard to shift that brain,

775
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:56,920
 especially at 13. My God. I get it. Yeah. I get it. You forget that Mr. Body's a real

776
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,640
 acting flex. You totally forget there's a big buildup before the murder happens. And

777
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:10,320
 Mr. Body has to be like, "I'm the greatest actor in the world." He has to come in. It's

778
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,200
 like the only actor in the movie you don't know who it is. Yeah, exactly. And he has

779
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,640
 to come in and just try his damnedest to take it over while Tim Curry is on the other side

780
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:27,520
 of the room just being Tim Curry. Exactly. Exactly. You just feel terrible for this guy.

781
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,520
 I watched it again. I watched it again like four years ago or something. I was like, "Oh,

782
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,920
 I forgot this guy really tries to throw a flamethrower. It just really isn't happening." It really

783
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:50,200
 comes across as a big lighter. It's just poor guy. He's just trying. Yeah. When I was younger,

784
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,520
 I did not appreciate, I did not comedically understand how subtle and awesome Martin Mull

785
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,380
 was being. So we were watching it as an adult. He's so funny. It's like, it's so subtle and

786
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:08,280
 he's such a groveler. It's so great. His looks are great. He keeps on touching Mrs. Scarlet

787
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:14,360
 in just vaguely inappropriate ways. And she just keeps on being annoyed by it and shooting

788
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,200
 him looks or hitting him or something. And nobody ever acknowledges it. No. I was just

789
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,680
 a little too young when they started doing the Fernwood Tonight reruns on... Yes. It

790
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,920
 went over my head. I just wasn't there, but I'm sure now I'd appreciate it a lot more.

791
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:38,440
 I missed Fernwood as well. Yeah. Oh yeah. We did it, guys. All right. We're just going

792
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,480
 to sit around now and think about nice things that we enjoyed from our childhood. Let's

793
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,400
 just think about old movies for a minute, guys. Just quietly. Remember there were movies.

794
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:59,680
 What was your favorite movie when you were 14 years old? 14 years old. Fern Gullywood.

795
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,600
 That's the one where they had to shoot the dog at the end. Oh my God. Well, they didn't

796
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:12,880
 have to shoot the dog. They got to shoot the dog. I'm sorry. They got to do it. They got

797
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:19,000
 to shoot the dog. Spoilers. Sorry, Latter Day Scoop. Spoilers. Let's do some Scoop Mail.

798
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,480
 Well, we got a Scoop Mail today from House Dad. After watching Rhea and the Last Dragon,

799
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:37,040
 what is Rhea? Or is that one thing? Is Rhea and the Last Dragon one thing? Oh, okay. So

800
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,240
 after watching Rhea and the Last Dragon, I asked my daughters what animal they would

801
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,000
 like to put a saddle on and ride around. I told them that I would put a saddle on a hippo

802
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,560
 because they are spectacular. Plus the land and water speed and maneuverability really

803
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:55,080
 checks all the boxes if you ask me. The three-year-old chose a cow, which is incredibly on brand

804
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:01,160
 for her personality-wise. The two-year-old went giraffe, which is very koala-like of her

805
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,600
 and a solid choice. Please allow me to ask you that same multi-million-dollar question

806
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:11,500
 besides my mom, what would you like to saddle and ride around? Lovingly, that's the House

807
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,640
 Dad. So other than House Dad's mom, what would you like to throw a saddle on and give a little

808
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,520
 ride to? Let's make it exciting. All the choices are only people in this chat. Okay. Okay. So

809
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:34,080
 we have Jobeth. We have... I would like to do a giant bumblebee. Giant bumblebee. Oh.

810
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,000
 Also, we're not even in real animals anymore. We're already out of real animals. I'm already

811
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,140
 out of real animals. I'm going to giant bumblebee because I don't want to hurt a real animal.

812
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,200
 I want to go with a giant bumblebee because I also want to fly around. It'd be like a

813
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:54,240
 sectar. Yeah. A gazoon type. Yeah. Yeah. You guys all remember sectars, right? Of course

814
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,400
 you do. That short-lived toy line, sectars. Do you not remember sectars, Jacob? No. Matt,

815
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,520
 do you remember sectars? I don't. So sectars... How many times can Paul say the word sectars?

816
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,400
 Sectars is a toy line. And see if Matt and I know what it is before he decides that we

817
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,160
 don't. It was a little expensive. The figures were a little closer to seven inches. They

818
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,500
 were pretty tall. And they would ride on the backs of giant bugs. And the bugs were the

819
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,120
 big feature of the toy line. So the bugs had these big wings that you could manipulate.

820
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:31,920
 But the cool thing was they were puppets. You put your hand into the bug and your hand

821
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,720
 became the bug's legs. Oh, I do remember that. I do. Of course you do because sectars were

822
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,960
 fucking cool. And so you would fly, you would fly them around and they'd be riding on your

823
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,860
 back and they had a huge playset. Their playset was jye fucking enormous. The sectar, it looked

824
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:58,280
 like just a wall, a chasm wall. It was really cool. But yeah, sectars would fly around and

825
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:06,680
 they're redoing sectars now. All right. Say sectar again. Sectar. I think I want to ride

826
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:14,680
 like a giant train, like a mechanical ball. Like, like wheel the giant train. What? You

827
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:24,080
 want to wield a giant train? And catch a ride at choo choo. Come on ride the train and ride

828
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:31,240
 it choo choo. That's what I want to do. All right then. I guess, I guess I won't stop

829
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:37,000
 you. That was bad in the chat with the say sectar one more time over. That was really

830
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:49,960
 fast. Say sectar again. Sectar don't sound like any toy line I ever heard of. You know

831
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:58,800
 what they call a quarter pound of sectars in France? Oh, what? Nerdy. I just found out.

832
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:10,200
 Le bugs and warrior. Le bugs, the finger legs. The bug, the finger leg. That's what sectar

833
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,640
 translates into. I just found out in the chat you can ride inside a train. That was really,

834
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:27,440
 what a waste of time. Oh, so silly. Oh, shit man. Oh, Jacob. I don't know. I think hippo,

835
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,960
 hippo is a good idea. Hippo is a solid rideable animal. It's tough to ride. I can't get your

836
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,480
 legs all spread way out. Well, you can do it in a saddle situation. It's kind of a seat

837
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,240
 situation. Maybe a nice side hippo saddle. Paul is holding his phone up to the camera

838
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:52,280
 now to show off what I assume is his amateur porn video. I'm just letting people, again,

839
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,400
 this is the benefit of joining up on the Patreon and coming into our feed. You get to see all

840
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,360
 the extra content like this. Like sectar, see they're finger fighting. As sad as this

841
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,860
 statement makes me, Paul's video has made me, oh Paul, your package has arrived. I like

842
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:14,360
 seeing Paul's notifications. My notifications coming up. It's pretty great. Also, Paul's

843
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,320
 video has made me realize I do know what he's talking about. Of course you remember. Everybody

844
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,360
 remembers sectars. I'm sad that Paul's video did something useful. They were expensive

845
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,280
 back in the day. They weren't- Yeah, I never had any. That's what I'm saying. They weren't

846
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:37,280
 a cheap figure. They were very expensive. Sectars. I have no idea what I was saying

847
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,680
 before that. Winterscoop put a cool picture there in the chat as well. Oh, in the chat

848
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:55,080
 here, Loane Buddy McQueen has selected horse. You know, I'm going to go with Buddy on this

849
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,720
 one. Horse seems like a really good one. But I got news for you, both. You guys live your

850
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:07,600
 dreams. You can do that tomorrow. Centaur, that'd be a good one, Leon Kassab. It's been

851
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:13,000
 a long- Have you guys ever ridden a horse? I have. It's been forever. When I was a kid,

852
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,560
 yeah. When I was a kid. I wouldn't do it now. Do you think you could still ride a horse?

853
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,280
 I have more respect for a horse than to put my 300 pound butt on my back. Oh, no, no,

854
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,640
 not that. But if you were on a horse, though, do you believe that you could still command

855
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:30,840
 a horse and ride a horse well enough? Yeah, I think I could do okay. It would depend on

856
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:38,360
 the horse, of course. Of course, of course. You really legit of courseed it. He legit

857
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:44,800
 of courseed it. It depends on the horse, of course, of course. I don't know, but yeah,

858
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:53,200
 I think I could. I think I could. I would love to ride a Clydesdale. Oh, those are,

859
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,120
 I believe, just impossible to ride. I guess, yeah, they're probably so big. You'd have

860
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:03,320
 to be so bowlegged. Yeah, they're just so massive. Oh, my God. Winterscoop saying Mr.

861
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:10,680
 Hands. That is the horse that rides you, Winterscoop. Actually, for my birthday this year, we're

862
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:16,080
 going to get a pony ride, so I'm going to ride a pony on my birthday. Oh, good, good.

863
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:23,320
 Nice. Do you guys know the horrible story behind Mr. Hands? What's Mr. Hands? Mr. Hands

864
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:31,400
 is the horse that was involved in one of those early freaky online videos that apparently

865
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:40,640
 was a cult of horse fucking people. And the Mr. Hands was fucking guys, right? They were

866
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,320
 getting fucked by this horse. You know, the horse didn't want to do it or whatever. But

867
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:53,560
 what? I know. But you were well aware of the whole bean situation and all that kind of

868
01:01:53,560 --> 01:02:01,040
 thing. And, you know, horse business is a bit bigger than human business. And the story

869
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:10,000
 was the story was that Mr. Hands got this guy, but ruptured his intestines. And he's

870
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,080
 died over time from being fucked by a horse. Oh, I have, I have found it. I found the Wikipedia

871
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:24,240
 page on it. Yeah. This is upsetting. It's dark. It's a real dark thing. And it's one

872
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,080
 of those. It's one of those very early internet things. I got to tell you for really remember

873
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,920
 for a masonry podcast. Do not screen share. I'm not screen sharing. I'm not screen sharing.

874
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:43,480
 It has taken a turn. Well, of course, of course, you got to fuck the right horse. Of course.

875
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,240
 Or don't. How about don't fuck horses? How about that? Oh, I've been watching. I've been

876
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,720
 watching a hard knocks on HBO, the season, the season camp for the Buffalo Bills. Yeah.

877
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,640
 And one of the linebackers, I think either a linebacker or a defensive lineman. He's

878
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,720
 really into horses and he has horses, he rides horses. And so they take the cameras out watching

879
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:09,480
 a huge professional athlete on the back of an equally huge cause he has like very large

880
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:17,720
 horses to accommodate his very large frame. Right. And it is so funny because he's just

881
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,120
 an enormous man on the back of a horse. And no matter how big that horse gets, it still

882
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:28,280
 doesn't look right. It looks like, it looks like you ride the kitten. Yeah. Yeah. It looks

883
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:33,720
 like, it looks weird that his feet aren't touching the ground because it looks like they just almost

884
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:39,160
 should be able to Flintstone that shit. Just get aside. He just give him a little kick

885
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:46,520
 to help out the horse a little bit. No big deal. Flintstones the horse. He's just running

886
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:59,000
 with the horse under his legs, touch the ground, cuts into the horse. It's a living. Let's

887
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,920
 do a little jock versus nerd cause you're about to lose your living.

888
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:40,440
 We got a scooper to come into us today from Leon Kassab. The categories are before they

889
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,800
 wrestled small facts, second biggest facts and cocktails. Leon and Chad.

890
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:57,240
 I'm going to go ahead and before they wrestled for 800, I'm going to shoot the moon.

891
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:03,080
 Oh, before becoming one of the world's biggest, one of the biggest stars in the world. This

892
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:09,480
 wrestler did quote the work of three men in the quote as a farmer. Oh boy.

893
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,640
 Ooh, I'm going to guess iron chic. Oh, okay. Let's try iron chic.

894
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:31,640
 Giant Andre, Andre, the giant Leon. Paul hates your game. No, I don't. Not at all. Oh shit. I

895
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:37,400
 also fucked that score up. I put nobody guessed. Paul got it wrong. Well, there's no point. It's

896
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,960
 all good. Right. Uh, you should have negative points. Oh no, no, I don't agree with that.

897
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:49,080
 Was that before or after Jack Kerouac drove him to school? I think it was after Jack Kerouac,

898
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:55,080
 but before raw doll. Okay. Um, I will take small facts for 200, please.

899
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:03,480
 At 32 days, this ninth president's term is the shortest in us history. Um, here's William Henry

900
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:11,960
 Harrison. William Henry Harrison is absolutely correct. I died in 30 days, died of pneumonia.

901
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:21,080
 Tippa canoe and Tyler Tyler. That's it. Yeah. Can you and Tyler to Tippa canoe and Tyler too.

902
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,840
 Uh, it's me. I'll try. Um, you learn your history. So you don't repeat it. That's why we learned our

903
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,640
 history today about Mr. Hands. That's right. That's right. I'm just trying. Don't fuck Mr.

904
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:36,040
 Hands between that and sectors. I've saved some lives today. Good job. Good job. I'll try small

905
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:41,080
 facts for 400 need to be more toys that you put your hand on answers. Oh boy. The smallest

906
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:49,240
 Incorporated town in the United States is Monterey, Nebraska. What is its population within 20?

907
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:58,440
 Oh, I'm just going to say, I'm going to say, uh, 21

908
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:12,600
 one mayor LCM Isler is the only resident. Wow. It's 21 within 20 of one. What's that election

909
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:19,240
 process? Like very simple. It's either very simple or very complicated. Yeah. It takes all year.

910
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:26,680
 Yeah. I think I get that right. I don't know what you're saying. I got it right. Uh, I said 21.

911
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:32,600
 I was within 20. Yeah. Well, Leon said fine. So there you go. Yeah. Great. Uh, Paul, uh, before

912
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:39,160
 they wrestled for 600, despite being part of a famous wrestling family, this superstar tried

913
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,400
 his hand at professional baseball before stepping into the ring. Damn it. That's the only one I was

914
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:49,000
 going to get right. My Joe man, Randy said, Oh wow. I didn't know that. Oh yeah. Randy.

915
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:59,080
 Uh, I know that the saints used to have the kid of one of the Legion of doom on there.

916
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:04,200
 Oh really? He was an offensive lineman. Yeah. He was a animals kid, animals child. That makes sense.

917
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,960
 Yeah. Yeah. Uh, they might still play. I don't know, Matt, you're up Anthony and buddy are right

918
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,720
 next to each other in my chat windows. Are they right next to each other in your chat windows?

919
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,640
 It looks like they're trying to punk us by like twinning right now. It looks like they're trying

920
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,480
 the same. I can't see even buddy. Now just lowered his screen to match it.

921
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:31,640
 Oh, I see him now. Oh, that's funny. It's like we're playing guess who with our, with our zoom

922
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:38,760
 chat right now. We've been defeated preaching fun.com. Join us on zoom. Yes. You get to see

923
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:45,320
 people do those, those kinds of things. Shenanigans of plenty on the zoom chat. I'll take small facts

924
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:52,120
 for 600, please. This point guard was the shortest player to start in the NBA. Oh,

925
01:08:52,120 --> 01:09:00,360
 it's either spud web or Muggsy bogues. Oh, I forgot about Muggsy bogues. It's gotta be spud.

926
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:04,520
 All right. Muggsy bogues.

927
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:16,440
 Y'all are both so confident. I think it's Muggsy, but y'all are both so confident that it was spud

928
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:28,280
 that you convinced me. I'll try small facts. England's shortest adult monarch was Charles

929
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:33,800
 the first who was estimated to be five foot four at the start of his reign. Approximately how tall

930
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:42,840
 was he by the end of his reign? I'd say approximately five foot four. No, he probably lost his head.

931
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:49,240
 Right. Oh, is that what they're doing? They're taking into consideration. He's like six inches

932
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,080
 shorter because he got his head cut off or something. Oh yeah. So yeah, I'll say he's

933
01:09:53,080 --> 01:10:00,280
 approximately one head shorter, approximately four, uh, four eight because his head was chopped off.

934
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,800
 And he answered him in, so he just gets credit. Yeah. Great. Just like what happened with Muggsy

935
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:10,280
 bogues. Just like what happened. He would have been a much taller basketball player. Yeah. Yeah.

936
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:16,040
 If he had kept his head. If he had kept his head. Paul. Uh, before they wrestled for 400, please.

937
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,760
 Prior to becoming a wrestling star, he played bass for the band

938
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:33,800
 ruckus presumably before SJ joined. Oh, I think this is Hulk. All right. Hulk Hogan. Yeah.

939
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:41,000
 Matt, this is where he came. He started saying like he almost was in Metallica. It's like,

940
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:49,000
 Oh, that's right. All the way off. You lie. You lie racist. He was supposed to be, uh, Mickey,

941
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,600
 uh, Mickey Rourke's part and the wrestler. Oh my God. He's just so full of shit. It's unbelievable.

942
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:01,000
 Yeah. Uh, Matt, you're up. Well, now he's full of dirt and worms. Well, not yet. I don't think,

943
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,960
 I think they're still getting an autopsy. There's some, some weird, yeah, there's some weird stuff

944
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:12,600
 about medical malpractice going on with his death. I don't know. Oh wow. Yeah. It seems to be, uh,

945
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:20,200
 yeah, kind of sketch. Gawker will tell us. Okay. Um, I will. Great. Gawker.

946
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:27,800
 Uh, second thing is, no, actually I'm going to do cocktails for 800, please. All right. Three

947
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:34,440
 ounces of dry gin, one ounce of vodka, one half ounce of lily blanc, stir with ice and strain into

948
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:40,920
 a chilled cocktail glass with a lemon zest for garnish. I think this is a Vesper. A Vesper.

949
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:49,000
 You're absolutely right. It's a Vesper. Oh, it's me. I'll try, uh, cocktails for 600.

950
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:58,520
 Two ounces of gin, one half ounce of Maraschino liqueur, one quarter ounce of cream de violet,

951
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,880
 three quarter ounce of lemon juice, shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass,

952
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:13,960
 garnish with a brandy cherry or a flamed lemon peel. Um, huh. I don't really drink much with

953
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:20,280
 the violet in it. Is that the, uh, the old rosy tip flip? Is that what that one is? That's what it

954
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,960
 is. The rosy tip flip. It's one of the few answers that's both in wrestling and in cocktails. That's

955
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:33,560
 true. That's true. Rosy tip flip is a move and a delicious drink. I'm passing Paul. I'm not going

956
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:41,560
 to guess rosy tip flip. I don't know. Passing. Coward. I love it. Oh, it was the rosy tip flip.

957
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:50,120
 Oh, so close. The aviation. That's the aviation. That must've been a, uh, Howard Hughes beverage.

958
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:58,760
 Yep. Uh, Paul. Before they wrestled, please. For two hundo. Before wrestling, he was a bodyguard

959
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:06,360
 for the Shaw of Iran. That is the iron chic. That's the iron chic. I knew that one. Matt.

960
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:16,600
 Uh, cocktails. 400. Daily double. Now it's the daily double of the day. Now it's still for 400.

961
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,520
 Two ounces of bourbon. Or sorry, bourbon. Three ounces of lemon juice. One and a half ounce simple

962
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:29,080
 syrup. One egg white shaken with ice and strained into a rocks glass or coupe. Interesting. Is this

963
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:38,280
 a proper? This is, I have, I used to make this drink all the time. It's in, uh, my old, old

964
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:43,320
 cocktail book that I have on my bar and I don't remember the name of it. Okay. So it's not like

965
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:48,920
 the first recipe of an original like old fashioned. I don't think so. Okay. Cause the egg white in

966
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:57,880
 there throws that off. Yeah. Uh, what is a Kentucky omelet? Show me Kentucky omelet.

967
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:05,720
 Oh, whiskey sour. Whiskey sour. Oh, that's not what I was thinking of at all. The sour mix. I'm dumb.

968
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:11,480
 But the egg white, I don't get the egg white in there. I think, I think a lot of original recipes

969
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,680
 called for egg white because it gave like a froth on the top and you shook it in the cocktail shaker.

970
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:24,120
 That's true. I'll close out cocktails for 200. Oh shit. It's the other daily double. Whoa. Holy

971
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:31,720
 rosy nipple flips. Alex for 1200. One cube of sugar muddled with, uh, I never know how to say

972
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:38,680
 that word. Bitters, uh, the angostura angostura. I think you got it. Bitters, uh, and a tablespoon

973
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,480
 of water. Add two ounces of bourbon or rye, stir with ice strain into a rock's glass garnish with

974
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:51,240
 an orange twist. It's a your mom. It's called Chimera bitters. That's it. But go on. Uh,

975
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:58,200
 that's the old fashioned. Yeah, there it is. That's what Ann loves. You got second biggest

976
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:05,240
 facts for two, four, six or 800 score check. I am at 2400. Paul is at 1200. Matt is at

977
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:10,840
 zero. I got 800 to try and keep it, keep it fresh. All right. 800 second biggest facts.

978
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:24,680
 Second most abundant gas in earth's atmosphere. Um, nitrogen, nitrogen is incorrect. Oxygen is

979
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:32,200
 number one. Shit. Nitrogen is number one. Yep. Ah, fart. Uh, Matt, I was told it was hydrogen.

980
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:37,960
 That's why I never lit any campus. Good idea. Smart. Let's play it safe. Stay in the dark.

981
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,960
 Um, I will do second biggest facts for 600.

982
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:51,160
 Second largest country in the world by area causing all kinds of hysteria.

983
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:07,160
 This is the worst beastie boys song ever. Let's do it. Uh, I don't know. Do you know there's a,

984
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,880
 there's a move, there's like a, a group right now trying to advocate for more accurate maps

985
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,720
 because Africa, the way we show on maps is basically seen too small. So they're trying

986
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:24,360
 to like create a different map so that we show how large Africa is. Um, yes, that's, that's,

987
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,440
 that's been a movement for, uh, for a while. Yeah. I think it's worth dedicating your life to it.

988
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:39,320
 Um, I don't know. Pass. Oh, that passes to me. Uh, yeah. I mean, it's gotta be second largest

989
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:46,840
 country by area. Oh, I've got points. I can play around a little bit. Um, so Russia's real big.

990
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:55,000
 China's real big. This isn't going to be one of those where like, because the maps are drawn,

991
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:03,240
 drawn wrong. It's like Greenland or something. No, I don't know. Uh, so Russia or China. I would

992
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:10,760
 think so. One of those it's gotta be, I think Russia is smaller than China's also Russia.

993
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:23,000
 Canada blame Canada. I will. Canada is a number two. Russia is number one with 6.6 million. Um,

994
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:30,280
 Oh miles square miles, I guess. Uh, yeah. Great. Canada. That's me. I'll try second

995
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:35,560
 biggest facts for 400. What is the second longest river in the world?

996
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:45,720
 Uh, let's see the Nile. Oh wait, shit. I was, I was getting confused. You got the Nile and the

997
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:51,880
 Amazon, the Yucatan, the Yucca and the Yucatan. Yeah. The Nile, the Amazon and the Yucatan and

998
01:17:51,880 --> 01:18:04,200
 the old man. That's it. Yeah. The old man river. Uh, I think, I think those are the two I'll say

999
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:10,680
 the Nile. It is the Nile. Nice. Amazon. Number one.

1000
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:17,320
 And Paul closing out the category and the game. Second biggest facts for 200.

1001
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:26,920
 Second longest reigning Monarch in world history. Oh, um, the second longest reigning Monarch in

1002
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:33,000
 world history. Uh, which Monarch stood in the rain the longest, which Monarch stood in the rain,

1003
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:40,440
 the second longest. I think it's queen Elizabeth one. Queen Elizabeth one is incorrect. It's

1004
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:49,720
 Elizabeth two. Ah, 70 years. Uh, Louis the 14th of France was first with 72 years. Oh man. Uh,

1005
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:56,600
 Paul got that wrong. Uh, but that doesn't matter. I win with 2200 points. Uh, Matt is in second

1006
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:01,240
 with zero points and Paul is in third with negative 600 points. If I had done all of the

1007
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:06,840
 scorekeeping correctly, that's from Leon Kasab. Thank you. Leon Kasab. If you want to send us a
