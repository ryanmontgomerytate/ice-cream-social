 And now, a show. Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social? Yeah I'd love to.

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:01:18,000
 Great, let's go.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,080
 Here we are. So you're in some alien jag right now? You know I'm always into aliens. You

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,640
 know I'm always, I'm always interested in the alien stuff. So Anne, Anne brought this

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,560
 up to me yesterday and I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but. Matt, any

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,480
 bets? I bet I haven't. I bet I haven't. Any bets on what you think this might be? Aliens.

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:57,560
 Well, who knows? The Senate is made up of lizard people? Nothing so, nothing so gauche.

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,160
 No. Oh, how great would that be? Do you have any idea how nice it would be to just find

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,920
 out that they were all lizard people the whole time? We'd all be like, ow, at least they

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,360
 were just lizard people. It would make more sense. Would you rather discover that the entirety

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,640
 of the Epstein List is just lizard people and not pedos? I, it would, it would weirdly

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,880
 I think make me feel better. Technically, yes. About life in general. I guess, right? Less

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,240
 pedophiles on the earth. I don't know. Anyway. Pedophile lizards, I guess that's a new problem

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,680
 we have to deal with. Anne brought this up to me and I was like, what? And I haven't

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,320
 really looked into it too much, but I just, I've just seen a couple of these headlines

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,240
 and it just popped up against me, my feed. And it says, uh, breaking a new study suggests

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:52,920
 that a potentially hostile seven mile long alien spacecraft may be headed towards earth.

24
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,600
 Scientists say. Scientists say. And what I love is that this was tagged by, this was tagged

25
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:10,360
 by a account I follow and their, their headline over this is what did Trump do in those Epstein

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:19,400
 files? It's like the kind of shit that people are coming up with for excuses. It's just

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,040
 ridiculous. Uh, but yeah. Anne was telling me about that. Do you guys remember Moa Moa

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,440
 a couple of years back? Yeah. The song Moa Moa. That's right. That's right. That's right.

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,160
 And that song is all about the cigar shaped turd looking thing that came flying through.

30
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,720
 I do remember the cigar shaped, uh, uh, asteroid or whatever. Yeah. Do you remember it? Yeah.

31
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,800
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and folks are still torn as to whether or not it had any kind

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,880
 of intelligence behind it or what it might be, if it was just the dead probe or what

33
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,720
 it was, but it was a very uniquely shaped space object and, uh, passed close enough

34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,760
 to us, uh, to be an interesting thing. So, uh, we'll see. Yeah. Uh, Bazzie says, yeah,

35
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,040
 it makes a lot of sense that a species capable of traveling over light speed has no stealth

36
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,360
 capabilities, right? I mean, things fall apart when you look at it too quick. Don't start

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,440
 looking at stuff. You, you're part of the problem by the, you're asking questions. Uh,

38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,560
 no, I, I honestly, I don't know. Wayne in the chat just says, sometimes the cigar is

39
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:38,400
 just a cigar. You'll get no argument from me, Dr. Freed. I'm afraid not, but, uh, that,

40
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,680
 that makes me laugh and who knows, uh, maybe, maybe the spaceman's are coming. Maybe that's,

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:58,200
 that's the big take. That's the first one. That's the first one. Maybe they're coming.

42
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,560
 Maybe they're coming. I, uh, I went to, uh, I just got back from Saratoga Springs, New

43
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,400
 York. Oh, I'm sorry, Matt. You don't want to talk about the space bands anymore. I was

44
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,200
 looking for an in and, uh, just that it's, it's seven miles long and it's a common just

45
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,120
 didn't give me too much. I mean, right. I, I, I need to go find the article. There's

46
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,640
 really not a whole lot more. I don't think. Why start now? It's too late. You should have

47
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,640
 found the article before we went on air. Oh, it just popped up in my feet again. And the

48
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,400
 fact that it hit again reminded me that Anne brought it to my attention. When Anne brings

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,200
 something to my attention, I find it newsworthy. It's go time. I'll look it up. I'll look

50
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,360
 it up. Oh, good. Good. Yeah. But, uh, but you were in Saratoga Springs for the horsies.

51
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,960
 Yeah. When saw the ponies and, uh, Nicholas Newman, uh, once again cemented himself as

52
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,840
 an honorary Donnelly child by writing up very hilarious pink sheets for betting sheets,

53
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
 uh, for it. Um, I do have to break the news to Nick via this podcast that as my older

54
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,040
 brothers were losing more and more bets, they became less and less interested in the comedic

55
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:14,560
 bits of Nick Newman. They weren't interested in laughing, losing money at the same time.

56
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,160
 Was Nick giving them tips? Nick has a hilarious breakdown. He breaks down every race in Saratoga

57
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,640
 and, uh, does things like highlights, uh, which, which horses are from Ireland since

58
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,360
 we're Irish. Um, he'll give me a gossip, uh, by the horse's owners. He'll, uh, make fun

59
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,840
 of, uh, the whole race as a whole. Like the, we were there Friday and Saturday. The Friday

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,440
 slate was the oddest slate of races. Cause the, uh, Saturday of course was the Jim Dandy.

61
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,840
 It's called Jim Dandy. It's a big horse race, but it's called the Jim Dandy. And I was like,

62
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,280
 what a finer isn't a finer race. It's like the Jim, but it's dandier. I've never understood

63
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,080
 that fucking song. Have you guys ever understood that fucking song? Break it down for us, Paul.

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,120
 That go Jim Dandy go Jim Dandy to the rescue Jim Dandy to the rescue. Do you know that

65
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,080
 song? Yeah. It's about a fella named Jim Dandy. I guess he was going to come to the rescue.

66
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 What the fuck is unclear about this? So I'll tell you what's unclear. What's with Johnny

67
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,240
 be good. What's, what are we asking him to do there? I understand everything about Johnny

68
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,840
 be good. Wait down in Louisiana, close to new Orleans. That's where he lived in a cabin.

69
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,400
 It was a cabin made of earth and wood. Yeah. He played his guitar there. He could play

70
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,840
 it very well. Almost like he was just ringing a bell. He had that much skill with the guitar.

71
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,640
 I know about Johnny be good, but the Jim Dandy song explains fucking nothing. It's just like,

72
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:53,320
 Hey, Jim Dandy, go, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy to the rescue to rescue who being helpful

73
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:01,600
 from what? Why anything bullshit? Jim Dandy is a traveling do good. Jim Dandy is a crisis

74
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:10,560
 actor. How dare you? Jim Dandy is seven miles long and one light year away from earth. Hey,

75
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,040
 look, it's like a cigar. I typed in seven miles and it went right to seven mile spaceship.

76
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:25,400
 So shit is real y'all. But right to it. The word is there at the interstellar object that

77
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,600
 I was referring to. It is known as 31 slash Atlas. It has been observed. It's quite large.

78
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,400
 Oh, 31 Atlas. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's been observed. It's quite large. Confirmed not to be a comet.

79
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,320
 It is confirmed to be a comet, not a spaceship and significantly further away from earth than

80
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,020
 a spaceship would be. Uh, the idea of constructing such a massive structure in space is a topic

81
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,560
 of ongoing research and discussion of field of aerospace. Well, they fucking just pooh

82
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,160
 poohed it all. Okay. So it's just an interstellar object. It's not a threat. Here's the thing.

83
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,560
 I have never been happier about an article that Paul looked up. The person poohing it.

84
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,160
 Are they a scientist? Cause the scientists said it was, it was an alien ship, seven miles

85
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,840
 long on its way to earth. They are, and they're clearly weighted. It starts off with the concept

86
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,720
 of a seven mile long spaceship is currently hypothetical though there is an interstellar

87
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:26,800
 object called 31 Atlas. Uh, it is a comet. So I guess people 31 Atlas, what do you get

88
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:40,440
 another galaxy older and deeper in debt? Still get that debt. So, uh, every summer my brothers

89
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,680
 and I get together with my dad and we go to Saratoga and spend a couple of days betting

90
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,240
 on the ponies. And, uh, usually it's right after foolish. And so, uh, me affording my

91
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,180
 own one person vacation on top of, uh, uh, you know, a family getaway, no problem. Thanks

92
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:06,680
 to the generous coffers of CW. Uh, but not this year. And so, uh, I've been a traveling

93
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,060
 magician man. And so I used points to try to get there cheap. And I used points to try

94
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,080
 to get me a rental car. Cause basically my points wouldn't fly me into Albany, the closest

95
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,240
 airport to Saratoga. Was there, there was a restriction. It just, it just wasn't. Yeah.

96
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,520
 I tried to use my points and there was no flights to Albany from Las Vegas, but it would

97
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,920
 fly me to Connecticut. Just about just under just a hair under two hours away. How's that

98
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,320
 bad? So I was like, Oh, I'll do that. And I'll run a car and I'll drive. I don't care

99
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,040
 about driving two hours. No, it'll be the wiser. No problem. And, um, I'm a fancy, I'm

100
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,680
 a fancy traveler guys, right? Yeah. I got the clear, you know, I'm, I'm a global entry

101
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,040
 member. Sure. Pre-check nailed it. I walk into the airport and I'm not, you know, I'm

102
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,280
 not checking any bags. I'm not doing magic now. And so I walk up. How does that feel?

103
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,800
 Does that, you, you, you, do you get a whole body vibe when you're like, Oh man, I have

104
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,160
 to worry about like shit, tons of trunks and stuff. Yes. Love. Yes. Yeah. Very happy to

105
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,920
 travel without checking two giant bags that I know to the pound, how much each weighs.

106
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:32,160
 I'm very happy. Um, uh, so I, uh, zip right through scan my eyeballs in the thing, fly

107
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,080
 land myself, uh, in, uh, in Connecticut, walk right up to the rental car counter, which

108
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,600
 is right across the street from the, uh, thing. And they say, uh, give me your license. And

109
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:53,200
 I go through my wallet and I cannot find my license down down down down. I am having a

110
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,440
 panic attacks. I've never, I don't, I'm not the kind of person that misplaces those things.

111
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,680
 You don't take your license out of your wallet. No, no, no, no, no. And I am going like, Oh,

112
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,000
 I don't have it. I go, I do have a picture of it. I always keep a backup picture of my

113
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,400
 license and my phone. And they took that and let you ride onto the plane, right? He's going

114
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,720
 for a car. I'm already, I'm already through the, I'm already landing in Connecticut. I'm

115
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,960
 already through the, through the, through the, through Las Vegas landed. No problem. I didn't

116
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,480
 have to get my ID out once. Oh, right. We're right. Okay. I didn't have to get my ID out

117
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,680
 once to get through the airport. And so I'm in Connecticut, two hours away from my family.

118
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:44,840
 And uh, I say, uh, and they go, uh, we can't, we can't rent you the car without the physical

119
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,880
 license. Oh man. And I was like, I have, I have a global entry card. This is my idea.

120
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,160
 I have a passport. I have a photo of my ID. Yeah, it's definitely you. They definitely

121
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,960
 run it up the pipe, get on the phone and they pretended to talk to someone like a car dealer

122
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:12,640
 does. Uh, they really pled my case and they're like, ah, we can't rent it to you. Yeah. And

123
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,960
 I was like, I, I'm not going here. I'm going to Albany and my whole family's like, what

124
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:27,240
 do I do? Like I had a total meltdown of like what I'm in Connecticut. I don't plan on being

125
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,440
 in Connecticut. I said, are you familiar with a show called Fool Us? Good, good. You tried

126
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,160
 to hire, you're dropping out. If you ever laughed at a, at a toss to commercial or welcome

127
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,560
 back to commercial on the, on the show, fool us. No, you fast forward those parts. Um,

128
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:51,660
 interesting. Outrageous. Outrageous. Those are arguably the best parts. Now that's not

129
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:00,400
 a winning argument, but it's arguable, arguable. Did you watch VH1 20 years ago? Do you know

130
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,880
 who I am? Uh, no, I just literally like look at them. Like I, like basically it's like,

131
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,240
 and now I'm just like, you know, I can't, I can't rent another car. I can't, I can't,

132
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,960
 I can't do this. And I am like, I guess I can look at them. If they didn't rent you

133
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,280
 a car that you were just going to stay there with them. I was kind of doing that by like

134
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,840
 sweating and mumbling and going like, what am I going to do? Uh, you're like, wouldn't

135
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,640
 you like me to leave? They definitely was like a team of three of them by the end. And

136
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,800
 they're like, yeah, we're so sorry. We got to get this guy out of here. I was like, I'm

137
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,720
 going to sit in that chair over there and look sad all day. Um, and so I call my brother

138
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,960
 hoping I catch them on the way to Albany where it's not too far out of his way to come pick

139
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:00,820
 me up. Got it. Uh, I, I'm wrong. It's way out of his way. Wayne Geo said I dropped.

140
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:09,240
 Did you, have you ever heard of the Donnelly Harold? Um, uh, he's already there. He's in

141
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:17,380
 Albany. Oh shoot. Well, and he goes, well, I don't know what else I'm going to do tonight.

142
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,640
 So he just gets in the car and he drives two hours. Oh wow. I'm going to pick up my brother

143
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,400
 to come get me. And then my other brothers jokingly said, boy, did you call the right

144
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:39,660
 brother? Cause we would not have got right in the car and come and go. Shout out. Which

145
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,480
 brother was willing to come Brian. Shout out to Brian, my hero. Thank you, Brian. Well

146
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,480
 done Brian. Um, and then I, I, I fronted the money for the tickets to the Saratoga and

147
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,400
 I was like, well, now I can't ask him for that money. I can't ask her to pay me back

148
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,560
 for that. No way. That's right. He's paid you back already. I'm done on that. I'm up

149
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,880
 paid in full that. Um, so, so it ended up costing me a little bit of money, but still

150
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,360
 nonetheless. Hey, but you got to, now did you have to pay, you didn't have to pay for

151
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,440
 the rental car, right? I didn't. Right. So it's all in points. There's a savings. Oh,

152
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,840
 you were going to do it in points anyway. I was doing all the points anyway. And then,

153
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,000
 and so I said to my brother when he drove here, I said, okay, either we can put the

154
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,280
 rental in your name so we can get it out of here and, and, uh, or you have to drive me

155
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,820
 back here on Sunday. Oh, right. Right. And so they let me, even with points, they'd let

156
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:44,480
 me, uh, switch him as the driver. Okay. That's nice to that. And then we had to pretend like

157
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,720
 he was going to drive the car the whole time, even though everyone, everyone knew the circumstances

158
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,200
 he drove here. And so we had to do the theater of him driving out of the lot. Oh, I've decided

159
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,360
 to leave my car that I just drove here, take this rental car. I can pay for my car to be

160
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:12,280
 parked here while I drive my new rental. Now, uh, for some reason, the cheapest rental,

161
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:19,080
 uh, from, uh, uh, enterprise was a Toyota Tacoma. It was not, it was not a tiny, not

162
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,840
 a tiny little, little pretty big coupe car, right? Right. That is that's happened to us

163
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,400
 in Texas. That has not happened to us outside of the state of Texas and Connecticut. I was

164
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,040
 not expecting the Toyota Tacoma to be the, the, the, the, this one. And so we get out

165
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,520
 into the lot and the, and the person helping us with cars says, I don't have any Tacomas.

166
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 Uh, you can take one of the, one of the, one of the Ford F one fifties. You can get bigger.

167
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:57,640
 And I was like, I drive a Corolla, right? So I was happily, you happily drive a Corolla.

168
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,760
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, yes. As my first car was a little, little Volkswagen golf, I've

169
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,080
 always enjoyed just being a guy who darts around town. Not big, not big on a, not big

170
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,920
 on a big space. We share, we share that. I do not like a vehicle that takes up much room.

171
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,880
 So I go, well, I don't have to take a big Ford over 50. I can, I mean, if you're going

172
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,840
 to give me, I'll take, I'll take one of the SUV trucks or whatever. He goes, no, those

173
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,960
 are an upgrade. Oh my God. I go, but the truck isn't, by the way, I'm talking for my brother.

174
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,480
 He's be driving. I'm just the one talking. Hilarious. I am the mouthpiece. He is the

175
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,960
 driver. It's my opinion that counts, but, uh, he's ultimately the one behind the beat.

176
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:47,720
 I'm the negotiator. He's the muscle. He's the silent muscle. So they're like, Nope.

177
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,120
 That's the only car you can get. Uh, like they won't even give me like a tiny car. They're

178
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,920
 like, no, that's the only, the only car you can leave this lot in is, is either a black

179
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,600
 or a white Ford F 150. What did you go with a white? You'll be leaving this lot in an

180
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:10,640
 F 150 or at a box. Or you don't leave at all. Now, did you go with the white one? Drive

181
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,120
 an F 150 off this lot or we will murder you. Did you pick the white one as just a kind

182
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,400
 of a knee jerk instinctual move because of Vegas training? Correct. I was just thinking,

183
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,860
 I was like, it's summer, it's hot. I'm going to take the white car. Also, I was like modern

184
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:39,840
 political sensibilities. We're limiting DEI. I should take the white car. Um, smart. Was

185
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,920
 this, was this rental place at otherwise, otherwise I'm going to get collected by ice

186
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,000
 for being a trader and they're going to go through my phone and find all, all my damn

187
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,280
 it all. Damn it. Damn everything. Already would leaving Connecticut. You're going to

188
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,880
 have to go through the border checkpoint anyway. I was like, I'm in Connecticut, right? They're

189
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:09,680
 like, yeah, I was like white. Yeah. This is a white town. Oh God. Uh, so Jacob, you live

190
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,640
 this life. I live the, uh, the truck life regularly. I drove around in a Ford F 150.

191
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,880
 It is different living. All I kept thinking the whole time was like, this is what Jacob

192
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,320
 does all the time. Yep. Yep. So really honestly, we were just having this conversation last

193
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,500
 night. SJ has become a very happy truck girl lately. Yeah. Yeah. Cause SJ has been driving

194
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,040
 the truck around a lot over the summer with a, with gigs. So I've been in the electric

195
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,480
 sports car most of the summer and she's been the truck gal all summer. But yeah, the driving

196
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,600
 a truck around is a different experience than driving a little car around town. Oh my, my

197
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,320
 sons are with me. They would have flipped out cause they love going in your truck. They

198
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,040
 would have loved going around in a truck for the weekend or whatever. But, uh, um, you,

199
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,520
 so every time you pull into a parking lot, you have to go like, oh shit. Every time you

200
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,880
 go like, all right, where do I fit? There's a spot. I was just pulling out of the parking

201
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,120
 lot this morning, this morning, leaving work. I was pulling out of the parking lot, driving

202
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,720
 normally in my lane, headed to a stop sign. A truck is coming in. The truck had to stop

203
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,080
 and wait for me to go around. So we could physically get into the parking lot because

204
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,660
 there just wasn't enough room in the two lanes made for the parking lot. That happens from

205
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,800
 time to time. Yeah. So that is something that just occasionally happens. So, uh, yeah. Like

206
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,440
 we were going to dinner and I just go like, all right, I let it go. Like, I'm, I dropped

207
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,480
 everyone out. I'm like, everyone go in. I'm going to need a minute to figure out what

208
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,440
 I'm going to do. I'm going to, can you just, can you order for me the thing? Just smash

209
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,640
 three cars and park there. Well, so this is it. Cause we went to, um, we, cause we went

210
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,320
 to, you know, the first, we went to two days of races. The first day we took my brother's

211
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:06,760
 car. He drives a hybrid Accord, like the, okay, like the woke hippie jerk that he is.

212
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:17,560
 You know, they just signed the hybrid Accords over in Scotland. Yeah. Yeah. Finally. But

213
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,320
 I don't think the hybrid Accords will stand, but my dad, you know, we're celebrating his

214
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,280
 birthday 87. He, he, he certainly enjoyed getting into the truck more than a hunching

215
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
 down into the old, the old Accords. So that's interesting. Interesting. So that's why my,

216
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,120
 my mother-in-law, whenever she comes out to visit, uh, her, her knees are bad enough that

217
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,360
 she doesn't enjoy climbing up into the truck. So I was going to ask what your dad getting

218
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,880
 up in there. Oh, he was like, he's got those new knees though. Nice. Yeah. He's got those

219
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,840
 new knees. He's got those robot knees. He don't give shit. He's 87. Those knees are

220
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,780
 like two or three. Right? Those are baby knees. Yeah. Don't fuck those knees. They are not

221
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:59,440
 of age. Those knees are in the Epstein files. Um, you could fuck every other part of Dave

222
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:11,080
 Donnelly, but not his knees. Don't do it. Oh my God. So we were taking the truck everywhere.

223
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,820
 So the second day we go to the races, you know, it's the Jim Dandy. Go ahead, Paul.

224
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,640
 Go Jim Dandy. Go Jim Dandy to the rescue. What the fuck is he rescuing from whom and

225
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:34,440
 why? No one tells you. No one tells you. And so, uh, and so, you know, it's, it's, it's

226
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,800
 Saratoga is a tiny little town. So when the races come up, it's like all these small businesses

227
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,200
 just open up and let you park in their little parking lots. And sometimes there are lawns

228
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,600
 and that kind of stuff or whatever. Right. So we're driving around and all the lots are,

229
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,680
 uh, are a little full cause everybody got, some people got there earlier. We went out,

230
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,680
 we went out for a lovely brunch where I literally was like saw a thing that said valet and I

231
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:08,360
 was like, should we go there for brunch? It's like, get this out of my hands. I can only

232
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:18,560
 shop and eat at places with valet. And so, uh, uh, we go and, uh, we pull up to this

233
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,360
 lot and all the lots, a lot full of the guy who's wearing a tie-dye shirt and he just

234
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,160
 stand there and he goes, and he kind of looks and he, and he points at me and I nod like,

235
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,240
 yeah, I'm looking to park, even though this is full and he, and he, and he kind of hustles

236
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,400
 up to my car and he goes, uh, you're looking to park. Yeah. I go, yeah. I goes, you're

237
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,640
 a lot full. He goes, I'm going to give you some VIP parking. Whoa. I said, okay. And

238
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,000
 he goes, uh, I'm right next to like the front of this little tiny storefront business next

239
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 to the, the, the larger lot that's full. He goes, you're going to park right there in

240
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,880
 the lawn in front of that, in front of that business right there. I said, what? And he

241
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,600
 goes, yeah, yeah. VIP parking, man. And, and I go, okay. He goes, uh, $20 because that's

242
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,320
 how much it was to park in the lot. It's $20 in the chat. It says best case scenario and

243
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,800
 I can't agree more. And, and I'm letting my dad whips out the 20s. I got you. And I was

244
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,400
 like, yeah, dad, sure. But I don't know if this guy works here. Yeah. He's like, you're

245
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:34,720
 going to park on that lawn. I don't know if he hates that business and wants to just fuck

246
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,080
 with them by putting a big truck in front of it. He's just out there causing havoc.

247
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,160
 You are overthinking this. I already would have been gone. I'm going to give you some

248
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:50,520
 VIP parking. Yeah. So we give him 20 bucks. He helps us guide us in. And then he's looking

249
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,680
 at me. Cause at first I go about it like the wrong angle. And he said to me like, what

250
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,040
 an asshole. And I'm like, this isn't my truck. I don't know how to park trucks on lawns.

251
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,040
 Of course. This is your first truck on lawn experience. And so, uh, uh, we finally get

252
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,000
 it in and as soon as I'm parked right. Yeah. He literally takes off, just runs. He just

253
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,840
 runs away. And that, that made you feel better. I was like, what am I? Does anyone know that

254
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,760
 I'm supposed to be? Am I committing a crime? Yeah. So I'm looking for the food for right

255
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,360
 now just to show you guys that I can, I can, I can, uh, put it on social media when the,

256
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,640
 when the episode comes out. Um, God damn it. Where is it? I was only gone for a few days.

257
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,700
 Was there anything else on this guy's tie-dyed t-shirt? Was it just tie-dyed? Just tie-dyed.

258
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,760
 So no, was he had to have a hat? Grateful dead shirt. It was just a hat. Did he have

259
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:57,320
 any like, uh, what are those things that the, uh, airline guys use? Oh, that is just like

260
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 a front lawn with a pickup truck. You just parked on somebody's lawn. Like filling up

261
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,200
 the front lawn. Yeah. And that's a business. And that's a business in front of there. What

262
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,520
 do they call those things? I don't know. Semaphore flags. I don't know. And there's a business

263
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,080
 there. And that business was not like the guy didn't go inside that business. He just

264
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,720
 ran away. So I was like, wonder if a guy was going to come out the door and be like, God

265
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,080
 damn it. Yeah. Parking on my lawn. No, nothing. Maybe somebody park on my lawn. It's probably

266
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,800
 his business and he's just going to go get a drink. It's probably fine. It was like 20.

267
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,400
 I don't think it was his business, but oh shit. Okay. I was thinking it was an old guy.

268
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,280
 And you know what? I will say maybe because you know what we owe people bitch about other

269
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,920
 generations lately as old man, uh, on the, you know, on the front lawn, um, the amount

270
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,800
 of young people that I've run into working lately are crushing it, are doing great jobs

271
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,800
 working. Like the super young people in the early twenties and the thought that popped

272
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,120
 in my head and I could be totally, I'm totally out of pocket on this and I'll happily be

273
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,480
 corrected. But I was wondering, I was like, Oh, the young people working now weren't working

274
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:14,560
 during the pandemic. That's true. They didn't, they didn't have that weird bowling ball wrecking

275
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,520
 ball come and smash the way they were getting by or anything like that. Yeah, that's probably

276
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,480
 true. And I feel like the people who were covering for the pandemic and working and

277
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,160
 working in like these, you know, food industry and like in hotels and low service industry,

278
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,240
 you know, kind of things really had a hard time coming back and like getting back to

279
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,200
 the grind. And so we were like bitching about it as people who were using these services,

280
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,960
 right? Right. The young people are lately, I've just run into young people who are just

281
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,360
 crushing it, just doing awesome. And so they're just doing it. Yeah. And so I was like, I

282
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,600
 was wondering if it was just like, it's still like, I think it's still like a, a pandemic

283
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,760
 versus non-pandemic thing, but maybe that's just my theory. That's my theory. Or just

284
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,560
 some generations are better than others. I don't know. One or the other. Those are the

285
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,700
 only two. You know, it could be both. It could be both. Maybe you're just running into good

286
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,820
 young people. There are a few out there. Maybe everyone knows like the singularities around

287
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,600
 the corner. So they're like, let's just work now. It doesn't matter. We're going to be

288
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:17,120
 just goo in five years. It's fine. I have heard from several sources. I'll tell you

289
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:26,080
 who else like Matt Donnelly really admires a lot of very, very, very young people. And

290
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,760
 that's the breaks. Pump the breaks. Like my dad's knees. Today's show is brought to you

291
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:42,520
 by country Gators, Gator country country tours. That's right. Country Gators, Gator country

292
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:52,080
 country tours. Hey y'all, I'm an alligator and I'm going to take you on tour. If you're

293
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,440
 ready to go. What I do is I take you through my swamp. What I like. It's out in the country.

294
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,240
 It's a country swamp. And what you're going to find is a lot of these here trees. They

295
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:15,440
 got knot holes in them. What looks like vaginas. So I call them countries. So you can fuck

296
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,760
 me if you want to. I ain't saying don't, but I mean, you know, splinters and whatnot, but

297
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,500
 you know, and some of them knot holes got critters in them. You might find your wiener

298
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,880
 up against the squirrely squirrel. So just be careful when you're doing it. But most

299
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,480
 of the trees I have in my swamp got big old vagina looking knot holes on them countries,

300
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:47,000
 as I was saying. And uh, yeah, that's what I do. And uh, and also I'll eat the smallest

301
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,960
 member of your tour. Cause that's part of my Gator ring ways. I am still a Gator country

302
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,000
 Gator. What? What? I'm supposed to not be a Gator? Huh? Yeah. What? I'm supposed to

303
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,240
 be nice, not eat you. Yeah. I got you. I y'all come up in here and fuck my trees and I ain't

304
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,160
 getting allowed to eat one of you at least leaving a bunch of nut leavens in my trees

305
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:22,080
 vaginas and I can't have a little snackety snack. Please. Now come on. And her hay scoops

306
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:33,640
 to check out. I just went back. I just got back from a Portugal. Yeah. Did you see Bazzy?

307
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:42,000
 Did you actually have an encounter? No, we didn't have an encounter. Portugal made me

308
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,680
 like New Jersey less. Oh shit. I was, you know, I can be offended except that I know

309
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,560
 what happened. You know, part of what happened. No, like I literally have to fly back to dream.

310
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,440
 My sister's coming in from Paris. She's staying at like a shore house and I'm, and I am thinking

311
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,120
 of not to not to get too far ahead of the story here, but I'm thinking of flying into

312
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,720
 Maryland and driving up my brother to fly out of Maryland because flying into Newark

313
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,720
 has been a disaster all summer. Yeah, we, we lost an entire day from our vacation because

314
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,560
 of Newark. I'll tell you, my, my wife would not recover from that. If we were on a family

315
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,580
 vacation and lost the day and got stuck in Northern New Jersey for a day instead of instead

316
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,980
 of Portugal, my, that would not be, did you have to stay overnight somewhere in New Jersey?

317
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,320
 No, we, uh, we stayed an extra night in Las Vegas. So we, we were able to come back home.

318
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,040
 We had a flight to Newark and then from Newark to Faro, uh, Portugal on the, on the Southern

319
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,580
 end of Portugal there. And our flight to Newark got delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed.

320
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,380
 And then finally got delayed enough that we were going to miss our connecting flight on

321
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:04,380
 the only flight, uh, to, uh, to Faro. And, uh, so we ended up just coming back home on

322
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,560
 Sunday morning and we try to get on Monday morning. Wait, it was morning at work. It

323
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,440
 was, it was going to overshoot your destination. No, we were going to get there too late for

324
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:27,360
 the, uh, connection. I thought you said too far. Oh, I was confused. Okay, trees with

325
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:40,880
 vaginas in them and shit. I eat the smallest number to fly into Newark was because they

326
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:50,040
 did not have adequate air traffic controllers in the tower there because fuck our government.

327
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,360
 They fire everybody and then don't hire the, I, whatever. No, I read one, only read one

328
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,900
 article about it, but apparently it's crazy, but they are actually are actively trying

329
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:06,440
 to recruit people to work in the air traffic control industry. And it is so, um, it has

330
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,960
 gotten so basically fratty. Like people are so kind of like hard on the new people and

331
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,080
 like, and like really break it down that people quit left and right and don't stick with it.

332
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,320
 Oh, it's super clicky to be a, uh, air traffic. Well, I think we need, I mean it's a, it's

333
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,760
 super difficult. And then it's like all of this other shit on top of it. Yeah. I mean,

334
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,800
 it's, it is a strange thing. And this is the, this is like one of those weird things to

335
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,480
 keep hearing about. Like all these jobs are going away. But then, and then you, then you

336
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,000
 hear about things where like, we can't get enough people to do this job that we definitely

337
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,600
 want to hire people for. And those things are, it's always so strange to kind of figure

338
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,560
 that all out, but I guess it's super hard hours and it's, and then, and there are so

339
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,400
 many, of course, super stressful, super stressful, right? You gigantic planes filled. Yeah, I

340
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:59,120
 was, I was going to say, uh, Carolyn Albert has a scoop. She has talked to us a couple

341
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,680
 times about her air traffic controller stuff a little bit. And yeah, air traffic controller

342
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,760
 stuff is nuts. Right. That's, that's nuts too. Uh, but, uh, we don't have to worry about

343
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,440
 that here in Vegas because no one's coming. No one's coming here. That's right. No problem

344
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,280
 with that. And for some reason we're talking about building a new $20 billion airport.

345
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:27,160
 Now I keep seeing conflicting reports here because I keep seeing posts from vital Vegas

346
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,120
 and he just put one up yesterday or maybe even today it was like, uh, you know, the

347
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:37,440
 locals are like, like you guys, nobody's coming. It's the ring, ring the death now. Yeah. Um,

348
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,120
 and then I'm not there, but okay, right. But then, but then, uh, other Jacob started, uh,

349
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:50,280
 doing, uh, doing weird, weird, weird pillow art on Etsy as a backup for, right. Yeah.

350
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,280
 And you know, okay, you say weird, it's hurtful, but okay. Restaurants or whatever are like,

351
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,200
 okay, yeah, we're not going to make, make as much this, this time around. But then he's

352
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:07,320
 like, but then also like Bally's just posted like, yeah, our, uh, our room rates, our room,

353
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:14,120
 uh, occupancy went from 99 to 97. We're still going to have a banner year. Who cares? Yeah.

354
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,600
 Yeah. Yeah. So it's weird. Like there's conflicting stuff, I guess. I don't know. Vegas is just

355
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,720
 changing, uh, as it has done a couple of times in the times that Vegas change. I can't believe

356
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,720
 it. It's just doing its change thing and going crazy about it the same way they do every

357
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,000
 time. Yeah. I think like, uh, like, uh, I actually see in our chat in our, in our zoom,

358
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,200
 we have Canadian scoop. Crystal labeled Canadian. So crystal, if you feel like unmuting to talk

359
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,680
 for a moment, we can actually check in with self identifies as Canadian because one of

360
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,360
 the storylines is Canadians don't feel like coming to know we're not getting this. You're

361
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,320
 not getting snowbirds, but, uh, um, yeah, our Canadian tourism is way down. Our international

362
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,920
 tourism in general is down. So can you, can you scoop crystal? Is that the sentiment?

363
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,360
 Is that true from where you're neck of the woods? A lot of people don't want to go down

364
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,880
 to the States and they're kind of avoiding it. I'm still coming to scoop fast, but it

365
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,720
 took some of my arm to get my partner to come with me. Well, I don't blame them. That's

366
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,600
 and we appreciate you guys going for it. Yeah. It's a little scary. You think we're going

367
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,240
 to be taken at the border? Like that they could like cold us and, and, uh, we, we've

368
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,040
 already spoken to ice and everybody to show them your scoop fest ticket and you'll be

369
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,760
 fine. Just be, just be like here. I'm going to scoop fest. I'll be, oh, right this way.

370
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,120
 I wish I could completely allay your fears, but I cannot. Uh, I don't know. It was pack

371
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,880
 a fake tip sheet of where aliens are hiding out. Illegal aliens are hiding. And then like,

372
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,760
 here you go. I'm doing my part. No, it's no, I've had multiple scoops, right? Saying they

373
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,400
 don't want to be stopped, uh, in airports. They don't want, they don't want, uh, people

374
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,520
 going through their text messages and the, or, or checking their social media and that

375
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,080
 kind of stuff. And I, in my, my guts say like, that's very unlikely to happen, but I can't,

376
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:12,520
 I also can't go, no. I mean, I just, I just came in through customs the other day in Philadelphia

377
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,480
 and it sure seemed like everybody was having a very easy time, but that's, that's one time

378
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,280
 and I don't know. Yeah. And, uh, Chris Gasman, uh, checking in the chat saying, of course

379
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,120
 she's wanting anyone going through his picks. And, uh, that's for multiple reasons. Uh,

380
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,320
 Mr. Mr. October, Mr. November, Chris, the plumber just, it's because he keeps assigning

381
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,580
 himself as Mr. That month. Yeah. They don't call gas man calendar. They don't call him

382
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:46,040
 nice pipe because of his job as a plumber. Do you know what I mean? No, no, no. Those,

383
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:52,760
 those crystals got a kitty on, on the video there. What's the kiddies name? She's already

384
00:38:52,760 --> 00:39:00,680
 muted. She's done with us. Uh, we couldn't agree on names. Okay. What? And I have a boy.

385
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,400
 It's got two names. No. So, so this is girl and then I have another cat named boy. That's

386
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:14,640
 great. That's I, you know what? That's how, that's how couples stay together. Unlike how

387
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,160
 we named our cats growing up, we would name them a black kitty and white kitty and, uh,

388
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,800
 mama kitty, et cetera. I like to be original, but I haven't been so much lately. Yeah. Yeah.

389
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,320
 I think that's original name Sonic. Oh, that's lovely. But also not original. I don't know

390
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,400
 how to tell you this. What neck of the woods are you in Canada? I live in Toronto, Toronto.

391
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,000
 And is there people, do you hear like around like general sentiment that people don't want

392
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,920
 to come to America right now? Um, I feel like it's mostly from my partner being like, Oh,

393
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,240
 no, people don't want to go. But, uh, like people aren't walking around saying, Oh, we're

394
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:02,480
 not going to the U S really weird if they were the first topic or whatever. Uh, well,

395
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,360
 thank you. Uh, uh, thank you for chiming in. I appreciate it. Yes, Crystal. Thank you.

396
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,000
 We appreciate boots on the ground reporting like that. We do. No, I mean, I think right

397
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,960
 now it's specifically in the summertime. So in the summertime we used to get a lot of

398
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,600
 European travelers that would come here, uh, division and they're not coming. Uh, also

399
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,160
 LA, right? LA is, uh, right now currently on tsunami watch, uh, still recovering from

400
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,520
 the fires and obviously had like honestly like been fighting, uh, political stuff in

401
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,000
 their own front yards. Right? And so those people are not blowing off steam to make sure

402
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,920
 they come out to, to spend some money at Vegas and hit the, hit the pools and the day clubs

403
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,360
 and all that stuff. And so, and that's, I think that's what it really is more than,

404
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,920
 more than people not wanting to travel and everything. It's nobody's in that mood to

405
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,520
 blow off steam. Everybody's got shit going on wherever they are. Yeah. Nobody's trying

406
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,920
 to come here and put a 20 in a slot machine. And, and, and sure. And I get it. Maybe, maybe

407
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,440
 occupancy is only slightly down, but I can tell you if people who are in shows that the

408
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,520
 show attendance is way down. Now show attendance goes down in these months anyway, but they're,

409
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,600
 they're, uh, they're going away. I also anecdotally traveling around talking to people who would

410
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:22,080
 come to Vegas. Um, my brother said it best Vegas has become spirit airlines. Uh, uh,

411
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,880
 uh, uh, Mark, not Brian, not my hero, but my asshole brother who would not come and

412
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,080
 get me. He said, uh, better than to call it. I'm interested in this, uh, analogy here.

413
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,600
 So why is Vegas now spirit airlines? I think I know right where this is going. It seems

414
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,160
 like it's cheap to come, but as soon as you come, you get charged for everything left

415
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,880
 and right. And as soon as you turn anywhere, suddenly you're just nickels and dimes and

416
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,320
 charged for every single fucking thing you do. And you leave feeling like, Holy shit.

417
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,040
 I thought I was going to spend a lot of money and I did, and I didn't even gamble and I

418
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,960
 didn't even see even, I only saw one thing and I'm, and I'm leaving, uh, uh, like broke.

419
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,840
 And so it is, uh, it's, it's becoming a real buzzkill for the town. And I, it seems like

420
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,320
 some places are kind of starting to combat that. It seems like people are, are people

421
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,560
 here seem to be realizing that. And some people seem to be going the other direction on that,

422
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,840
 but it hasn't caught on in the big time yet. No, there's like I said, these are small temporary

423
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,080
 measures that people are taking just for the summer. They're waving. Some people are waving

424
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,360
 resort fees, some people waving parking fees, and that's exactly what this whole town needs

425
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:33,440
 to get back to doing as a whole. Yeah. Free parking. Well, I think also it's, uh, a comment

426
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,000
 on the fact that gambling has just become so ubiquitous. Like you can just gamble on

427
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,680
 your phone. And it's funny cause it's, it's, it's these companies that spearheaded it.

428
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,000
 That's the weird thing. Like you think, you think Vegas would be protectionist, but these

429
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,360
 companies are protectionist, the Vegas, they're simply saying, if anyone's going to gamble

430
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,480
 anywhere, it should be through our company. Right. And so they, and there still is a Vegas

431
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,320
 element connected to it all. You know, like the bed in G MGM is like, that's their whole

432
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,840
 tag lines. Like the casino created in Vegas, that, that, that, that, but it's simply not

433
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,480
 as exciting to sit in front of a slot machine at Monmouth racetrack in ocean, New Jersey

434
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,900
 and spend a day pulling levers there. Like it's just not, that's just not going to create

435
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,800
 the same deal. Right. Well, I can tell you out here, we got these fucking skill games.

436
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,040
 You ever heard of these fucking things? Oh yeah. What are skill games? Skill games. I'd,

437
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,720
 I put a fiver and was like, you gotta go try the skill game. I'm like, all right, whatever.

438
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,600
 I put a fiver in, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing. It is confusing and weird. I

439
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,000
 didn't understand it. It had a bunch of symbols. You press stuff, you lose your $5. It takes

440
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,760
 a little longer. It doesn't make any damn sense. Didn't make any damn sense to me whatsoever.

441
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,000
 I was like, what am I doing with this thing? I need a lesson on the skill games, but I

442
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,040
 don't know. It just seemed really, really dumb. I don't have the skill. That's true,

443
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,400
 Wayne. Yeah. I think that's up. You went into a skill game unskilled. What did you expect

444
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,800
 buddy? No, it's what I don't know. I don't understand. I didn't understand what I was

445
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,960
 even doing. Well, the good news is that we're protected from the aliens that are coming

446
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,520
 because they can't afford all the resort fees and no, no, no, no. And the cocktails. Well,

447
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,320
 apparently it's not even aliens. It's just a theoretical thing about seven mile wide

448
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:29,080
 comet. It passed the comet test. It took a test. There's a little box at the bottom said,

449
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:35,400
 check if you are a comet. And it checked it. So it said, Oh, I checked it. I am a comet.

450
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,280
 And Ranch Slunk is asking, what is the part that is skill? I don't know. I played it for

451
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,480
 like 15 minutes. I'm like, I don't understand what's going on here. Paul has never known

452
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,880
 what part of it was. I take it back. I take it back. I take it back. Now my memory is

453
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,880
 getting jogged. I do remember once you get to the bonus round, I basically was playing

454
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:04,400
 Simon. The bonus round was Simon. Okay. And I made it through like five things and then

455
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,800
 I fucking messed up the pattern. So yeah, there, that's the skill, but it still made

456
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,800
 no fucking sense. So yeah. All right. This is all a big buildup by next year. It will

457
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:26,680
 be fuck Mary skill. That's right. Yeah. I'll tell you who else is going to fuck Marion

458
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,760
 skill. And that's the following sponsor, a new service that helps Paul buy back all his

459
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,640
 toys when he feels sellers remorse. That's from the red Baron in 2021. Oh, the last one,

460
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,480
 by the way, is from country scoop. Uh, this is a service that helps Paul buy back all

461
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,920
 of his toys when he feels sellers remorse. Hey, what's going on? It's me country Gator.

462
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:56,800
 Uh, I actually also run an Etsy shop and, uh, ideally in secondhand toys and collectibles.

463
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,760
 But I'll tell you what, if you in the market for an original teenage mutant, Ninja turtle,

464
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,440
 or maybe an old school transformer, I got you covered. But, but, but really it's a front

465
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,680
 and I sell logs. I sell logs that have the vagina part, not holes in them. And I can

466
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,840
 get them across country lines. So you can, you can look up, you can say, I'm buying me

467
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:30,000
 a toy. It's a toy. All right. But it's a special toy. Yeah. It's a not hole tree that you can

468
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,440
 put your Willy in. And I can't guarantee it ain't going to be no squirrely's in there

469
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,720
 still. I can't say for sure. But also if you do just want to go to trip down nostalgia

470
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,900
 lane, buy yourself an old toy that you used to have, you can get it. Just come on on my

471
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:55,920
 Etsy shop. It's country Gators, country toys. Uh, yeah, but as well, wow. So it's country

472
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,400
 toys, huh? Yeah. It, it's one of those things where, you know, you, you do your advertisements

473
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,480
 and you make them real controversial. And then people like, Oh, did you say country

474
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,960
 virtual? Country virtual. Yeah. And so it's kind of like, uh, it's like a schmuckers.

475
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,440
 Yeah. Yeah. You know, country toys. They must have something on the ball calling themselves

476
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:28,960
 that shit. Sure enough. Now are the toys country or they for country? They can be anything's

477
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:36,400
 a dildo if you're brave enough friend. Guys, I just got a text. I'm so glad it's Amazon

478
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,940
 looking out for me. They texted me and 19 other people who happen to have a North Jersey

479
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:47,500
 area code phone number, but more convenient. They're looking at for safety and quality

480
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,400
 issues of product that I bought. They won't say which one until I click on the link. Safety

481
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,280
 is their top priority. So there we go. I don't want to, I don't know. That shit was on the

482
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,520
 rise for a while, but it seems a little more prevalent in the last couple of months. Am

483
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,480
 I crazy? I don't know. I get it. I get it. I get it. I don't know either, but I'm getting

484
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,480
 a lot of these fucking spammy things. Yeah. In my day. Yeah. All I know is that Democrats

485
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,080
 are feeling more confident because in the recent days I've gotten a ton of different

486
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:29,200
 people asking me for money. And I think that's hilarious. And I always hate when it's like,

487
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,880
 Oh, did you see Pete Buddha judge just top roped Trump into submission with this. I swear

488
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,920
 to God breathing every time I am so done. I don't know who thinks that messaging is

489
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:49,400
 working anymore, but it is fucking not. It is not working for anyone. Cause nothing's

490
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:56,800
 changing. Nothing's changing. Nothing's happening. Now someone sends me a things like this motherfucker

491
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,040
 ran off the Senate floor with a can of Barbasa and a razor blade and shave that motherfucker's

492
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:11,040
 eyebrows off. I'd be like, here's $20. Thank you. Here's $20. I appreciate your fucking

493
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,520
 service, but nobody's doing anything of any meaning or merit. So it's preposterous. Yeah.

494
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:25,480
 I did see they made me laugh. It showed a, there was an AI image. It showed Trump using

495
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:33,040
 a comb over and his hair is covering the Epstein files on top of his head. It really, it really

496
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:39,720
 made me laugh. It is the strangest. Oh, that's really funny. It is the strangest fucking

497
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,380
 thing at this point, right? Yeah. It's just, I mean, we are, we are through the looking

498
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:50,840
 glass here, people. I mean, it's, it's bizarre, right? There's no defense for any of this.

499
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:57,160
 And I think that's the other crazy thing is there's a lot of folks like us who, you know,

500
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,440
 we hear these talking points of like, Oh, Bill Clinton might be on that list. Fuck that

501
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,120
 asshole. Get them all. Bury him under the jail. I don't give a rat's dick. Put them

502
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:16,080
 all in the cemetery. Yes. Everything should be collapsed. The whole government at this

503
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,960
 point. I don't give a good goddamn. Oh, and I, I'm going to steer off from that, from

504
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,040
 the, uh, from the government conversation in a very, uh, easy way. I'm going to tell

505
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,360
 you about my trip to Portugal this last week. Yeah, it's just, yeah, it's just, yeah, there

506
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,240
 you go. Scully. Thank you very much. Scully's Scully's on point. That's all you need. That

507
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:44,440
 meme is what we're living right now. Absolutely. We're all looking for the guy who did this.

508
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,280
 So we get down to Portugal. Uh, we fly into Faro in the south end of Portugal. Yeah. It's

509
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,960
 fantastic. We stayed in, uh, Gia or Gaia, depending on, uh, on how you say it, different

510
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,960
 people said it different ways. Derived from mother earth. Uh, yes. Well, I mean, it sounds

511
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,040
 like that. Yeah. I didn't name it. Did you find out what Portugal means? In America,

512
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,440
 we pronounce it grapes, Jacob. Grapes. Yeah. Yeah. Like bossy, the Portuguese scoop in

513
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,040
 the chat here says Gaia. Okay. And then another friend of mine, uh, says Gaia and then people

514
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,600
 there, uh, some people there said Gia, some people there said Gaia. I think, I just stopped,

515
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,680
 I stopped saying the name entirely just to be safe. I bet you it's a bit to just correct

516
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:36,600
 tourists no matter what they say. Fine. If it was good bit, uh, Jacob, it's pronounced

517
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:43,640
 Chimera, but go on. Uh, so we, we hung around down there. It was just wonderful. Our friends

518
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,840
 Scott and Paula, uh, we, we hung out with them and, uh, boy, we had great food. We had

519
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,560
 all kinds of just wonderful experiences there. A couple of different beaches. What was your

520
00:51:53,560 --> 00:52:00,920
 favorite meal, Jacob? Oh boy. We had a, we had a meal at a winery, uh, that was just

521
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:08,680
 fantastic. Uh, we also had this, uh, spicy chicken at one place. Yeah. That was, uh,

522
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:16,220
 it's a main dish of the region and, uh, it was so fucking good. It's, it's like a hot

523
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,200
 oil, uh, that gets poured over the chicken. It gets cooked at a really high temperature

524
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,160
 for a short amount of time. It's just quick. I assume it's not fried. It's not fried at

525
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,720
 all. It's like roasted. Oh, uh, and I mean, it is, I, I assume that there is some kind

526
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,160
 of, um, preparation to it as well. I don't know if they soak it in the spicy oil or whatever

527
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,320
 marinate first. Uh, yeah, I don't know if they, if they do any kind of like the marinade

528
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:47,720
 or whatever, uh, but it is slap it. So fucking good. It is so slap it. The slap cook it.

529
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,280
 Remember, that's right. They give a good old slap. Period. Period. That's it. Uh, winter

530
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,720
 scoop. Thank you. Period. Period. Chicken. That slap cooking chicken is the wildest fucking

531
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,320
 thing. That chicken. Those, those videos are awesome. Those were forever. Stay in my brain.

532
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,760
 Cooking the chicken. Well, that's cool. Um, so we did that for a few days and then we

533
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:16,520
 took the train, uh, north to Lisbon and, uh, I'll tell you about the part in Lisbon because

534
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:22,440
 it was everything in the south was very relaxed. We had just a wonderful time, so much beautiful

535
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:28,920
 scenery. Uh, it was a wonderful week. It doesn't make for the best stories on the comedy podcast.

536
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:36,760
 So I'm going to tell you about Lisbon instead. We got on the train to Lisbon. First of all,

537
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,800
 we got off the train earlier than we were planning to. We had, we had booked a, a booked

538
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,280
 passage to this, uh, one station and we decided to get off a couple of stations earlier. Once

539
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,200
 we got to Lisbon because we were like, Oh, it's a little closer for a hotel. It's in

540
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,720
 the area that we want to be in. We're just going to get off here. So we get off the train.

541
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:00,520
 It's pronounced Lebanon. Sorry. We get off the train in Lebanon, Kentucky. It was a very

542
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:06,600
 long train ride, very wet. And, uh, so we got off the train. The fact that my hometown

543
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:13,240
 was called Lebanon. I know the fuck Lebanon is fucking crazy. Life is crazy. Don't forget.

544
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:23,800
 Uh, SJ went to high school in Palestine. Don't forget it's not just Kentucky. No, it's not.

545
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:31,800
 They're all. So we get into an Uber and the Uber driver that we got in, in, in Lisbon

546
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,840
 spoke the least amount of English of anyone that we had interacted with the entire time.

547
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,880
 Perfect. Everybody, everybody spoke English at least to a passable degree. No problem

548
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,920
 at all. Uh, we get in the car and, uh, you know, first thing to say to this guy is that

549
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,880
 do you speak any English? And he goes, he holds up his fingers very close together and

550
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:59,960
 goes very, very little. All right. No big deal. Now, did you think I can use Google

551
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,480
 translator? One of these automatic. Oh, we had been doing, we had been doing that to

552
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,640
 some degree, but like he, he spoke enough English and you know, it's an Uber. So he's

553
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,280
 already got the destination. We don't have to have a conversation. Did you think about just

554
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:20,120
 yelling English slowly at him? That does seem to work, right? Overpronouncing English words

555
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:29,800
 loudly. The winery please. Turn left here. Oh boy.

556
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:35,880
 But it's no big deal. He doesn't speak a lot of English. No big deal. He's got, he knows where

557
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,920
 we're going. He's going to drive it. It's, you know, a 20 minute drive. Uh, so he says

558
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,680
 in, in broken English, he says, get comfortable. Uh, it's going to be a little bit of a drive,

559
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,480
 uh, no big deal. We go great. And so we sit back. We're having a little conversation between

560
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,080
 ourselves. Uh, we're kind of figuring out what we're going to do that evening. How many are in

561
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,680
 the car and then a small, the small pane of glass comes up separating him from the group

562
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:10,280
 and then gas just fuels into the back of us. You all wake up in bathtubs with a phone next to you.

563
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:20,440
 Your kidneys have been taken. We ride in silence for about 10 minutes and then he started talking

564
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:29,800
 and his lack of English did not stop him for long. How strange. Yeah. So he initiates a new

565
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,560
 conversation and he just starts talking to us in English, in English, in as much English as he,

566
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:44,200
 as he could. Uh, and so we're, we're having a bit of a conversation with him and then he starts

567
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:52,440
 talking about the blacks. Oh no. Quote unquote. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

568
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:01,480
 And he starts selling us how the blacks are taking his, are taking his jobs. Oh my God.

569
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:08,200
 And we are sitting there going like, what the actual fuck? Why is this guy telling us about

570
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,160
 the blacks? And he talked about the blacks for about five minutes. Yeah. And then he said

571
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:22,200
 something about Uber, right? He went, Oh, Oh, motherfucker. He's talking about Uber black

572
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:29,720
 language barrier. He's talking about cause he drove an Uber comfort. Okay. And so he was saying

573
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:36,040
 there's more and more Uber blacks now and they're taking business away from the Uber comforts.

574
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,240
 Don't let, don't let these people know about the Uber blacks. That's, that's the last thing they

575
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:47,720
 need. That's the last talking point. This guy's back seat. It is, it is very nice Tesla that he's

576
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:55,480
 driving us around and I am just laughing to myself, relieved. Right. He was talking about

577
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:03,800
 the Uber blacks and not the black. Goodness sakes. And then he pointed at a black person on the side

578
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:11,560
 of the street and said, Oh, I don't pick them up. No, no, he did not. He did. Oh, for God sakes.

579
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:19,240
 It was like, Oh, God damn it. So he was actually talking about it. No, he wasn't. He wasn't. He

580
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:25,640
 was talking about Uber blacks. You rode the full roller coaster of racism, right? But this guy's

581
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:32,120
 clearly an idiot. So maybe he thinks Uber blacks is just for black people. Maybe, maybe what a dim

582
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:38,040
 wit. And so he, he then tells us, he says, he's, he's taking us to an area. Uh, our hotel in Lisbon

583
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,920
 is in an area, kind of at a downtown area and right, right nearby there, there's an area called

584
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,640
 pink street and pink street used to be, I guess, the, the red light district. It was the brothels

585
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,400
 and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. And now it's restaurants and bars and there's a lot of live

586
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,440
 music there, which is why SJ and I were, uh, you know, heading in that direction. We're going to,

587
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,520
 we're going to go hang out in the, in the, in the pink street area that evening and listen to some

588
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,320
 live music. It's going to be great. We're really looking forward to it. And then he starts telling

589
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:11,480
 us that this is after the conversation about the blacks. And then he starts telling us that, uh,

590
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:17,640
 Oh, by the way, don't go to pink street tonight. And we had not said that we were going to pink

591
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:23,400
 street, but the hotel was just nearby. And so he goes, don't go to pink street under no circumstances,

592
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:31,960
 go to pink street. That's all we say. Why? And he goes, uh, and then he goes on his second racist

593
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:40,040
 tirade of the ride, but this time it's about the Roma. Oh, and so, and so then he said selling,

594
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,800
 telling us how the Roma are in town and they are shooting each other on, on pink street.

595
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,440
 And, uh, but that's a festival tradition, the shooting of each other.

596
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,400
 Right. You ever been to a San Gennaro? Come on. What are we talking about?

597
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:02,120
 Roma the bulls and Pamplona. The Roma just shoot each other on pink street. That's just,

598
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,360
 and at this point I really am just sitting there going like, I'm ready for this ride.

599
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:16,360
 Of the patron, the patron saint of ammunition. You celebrate him. Um, yeah, bossy bossy in the chat is,

600
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,240
 is hurrying the story log and tell it saying that of course that's not true. And of course bossy is

601
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:26,360
 100% correct. Right. Spoiler alert. There was no shooting of anyone. And yes, we hung out everywhere.

602
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:32,200
 We wanted to hang out. This guy is just a racist asshole. That's it. And honestly, the entire ride

603
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:38,600
 and still right now, I think he was being racist, but I'm not entirely sure because it really may

604
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:45,720
 have just been a language barrier. No, I'm telling you, I'm still, I'm, I'm pretty sure he was being

605
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:55,320
 at least racist some of the time, but I'm not, I'm still, I, yeah. Oh, about the Roma. He was

606
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,840
 definitely being racist. He was deaf. Sorry. Let me be very clear. He was definitely being racist

607
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:07,080
 about the Roma. I'm not sure if he was being racist towards people who were dark in skin color as

608
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:12,120
 well. Jason has a great question for you in the chat, Jacob. Oh, what is it? Did you give them five

609
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:22,040
 stars? I honestly don't think that I ever got back around to reviewing and doing all the stuff. Yeah.

610
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:28,520
 You're too stupefied. So he tells us like, Oh yeah, don't, don't go down there. It's dangerous.

611
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:36,200
 Whatever. We finally get out of the car and we're like, our hotel was literally above pink street.

612
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:41,800
 Like you had to walk out of our hotel and walk down like a ramped alley and you were on pink

613
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:48,200
 street. So I mean, we were directly above it. We were in such a party area of this, of this place

614
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:57,400
 here that our very nice hotel gave us earplugs to sleep in. Oh my gosh. And rightly so. Really?

615
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:04,360
 Absolutely correct. How long, how, how late into the night did the, the party go? I mean, by the

616
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,800
 time I fell asleep, it was still going. Which was? In Portuguese, how do you say to the bric-a-bric-a

617
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,520
 dawn it's on? Oh, that's a bric-a-dawn. Oh, okay. That's actually, that's actually Portuguese.

618
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,880
 Universal. Yeah. That sounds right. Did you understand that you were going to be staying

619
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,520
 in that type of an area when you shopped for your vacation? Yes. Okay. Well, we were only staying

620
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,200
 there overnight because we were flying out the next morning. So we were only in that hotel one

621
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:35,080
 night. Well, and, and you coming from New Orleans, you've done your share of Mardi Gras. And we

622
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,840
 understood what we were getting into. You know what it's about. Right, right, right. We, we were not,

623
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,600
 we were not upset by this. We were just, we understood what we were getting into when we,

624
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:48,600
 when we stayed in that area. It's actually funny because I was on my flight back from Connecticut

625
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:54,200
 to Vegas. There was, there was some Roma on my flight and they just shot each other right there,

626
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,920
 right there in the aisles. Just right there. Just dead, just two, two shot dead people. Oh yeah. And

627
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,440
 he went into all this stuff. He was like, he went into all this stuff about how you can identify

628
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:11,880
 aroma if we, if we see them. Oh, we're not identifying aroma. This is getting weird.

629
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,280
 He was telling us how they all wear white t-shirts, which I thought was very vague.

630
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,400
 I was like, okay, that's weird. And then he started telling us about how they all had,

631
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,560
 he didn't say the words meth teeth, but he was saying meth teeth.

632
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:32,680
 Summer teeth. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. He was saying their teeth are a little meth-y.

633
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:41,000
 So we went to pink street though, and we had a wonderful time. We went and saw some musicians.

634
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,800
 It was great. We had some, we had some cocktails. It was really wonderful. We walked, well, we went

635
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,640
 and had a nice dinner in Lisbon first and walked all over and looked at some, some different statues

636
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:58,520
 and walked down by the pier. It was all great. We got to pink street and literally, I don't want

637
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,960
 to overstate this. I don't want to make it clear that this is not me exaggerating for the show.

638
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:12,440
 Within the first five minutes of us just walking around on pink street, I was offered cocaine three

639
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:22,040
 times, not drugs, not party favors, specifically cocaine. I was offered that, uh, just walking out

640
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:28,840
 at Cozumel at like noon. So I don't think that's a, I just like, I turn and walk onto the street and

641
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:35,640
 the first person I see literally makes eye contact with me, puts his finger to the side of his nose

642
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:43,640
 to gesture for cocaine and then says, want some cocaine? Are you sure that wasn't Santa Claus?

643
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:50,440
 Cause that's his move. There must've been some magic in that old white powder he found.

644
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:57,000
 I was like, why did you gesture for the cocaine if you're then going to explicitly offer me the

645
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:05,400
 cocaine? Well, there are other ways to take it. Sure. As Paul takes it, you can take it

646
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:12,280
 intravenously. Or he could, you know, he might've, you don't want to go up to the drug dealer who's

647
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:20,840
 like pointing to his asshole. Cocaine? Do you want some Bolivian gunpowder? Bolivian marching

648
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,000
 powder in your shorts? Do you want Bolivian marching powder, which is slang for cocaine? Would

649
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,120
 you like some of that? Do you skewer? Insert penalty. And by ski, I mean, do you, do you do

650
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:39,720
 mountains of cocaine? So we've got three, three offers of cocaine in the first five minutes,

651
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:45,320
 two offers, two, two more offers. Nose candy where the candy is cocaine for your nose.

652
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:53,720
 So it's not made of cocaine, but cocaine. Not even a whole lot of cocaine. It was great.

653
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,000
 There were traffic circles in the area that we were in, especially there were traffic

654
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,320
 circles everywhere. Not a lot of streetlights, which I kind of enjoyed. Roundabouts, you mean?

655
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:09,720
 Yep. Yeah. Roundabout traffic circles. We saw one fella at a large traffic circle, you know,

656
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:15,560
 in the city, big roundabout, you know, huge statue in the middle of the whole deal.

657
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:22,280
 And anyhow, you get on a roundabout and you get on a roundabout, it might have four entry exit

658
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,120
 points and it'll say like, oh, you, you get off on the second exit or you get off on the third exit

659
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,360
 in the roundabout. And that's how you, that's how you do the roundabouts. We saw one guy in the

660
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:39,160
 middle of Lisbon, uh, turned the wrong way onto the roundabout and, uh, he was, uh, yelling and

661
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:44,760
 it looked like crying all at the same time while, while they were trying to figure it out. I just

662
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,520
 wanted a can of Coke, an actual can. That's it. He just, he was just trying to get somewhere and

663
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,760
 he, he didn't know how to drive in Lisbon and he was very stressed. Oh my God. Basi says there's a

664
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:00,600
 city with 32 roundabouts there. Oh yeah. I would lose my fucking mind. In the South, especially we,

665
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,400
 we saw like two traffic lights the whole, the whole time we were in the South of Portugal.

666
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:12,360
 They are building, they're building more and more of those out here in Pennsylvania. Oh yeah. And

667
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:19,240
 nobody knows how to use them. And I am also in that club and I do not like them and I do not like

668
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:24,120
 them building all these roundabouts. They are more efficient. You're right. People in, in, uh,

669
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,040
 people in the chat are talking about how they are much more efficient than, uh, treat street lights

670
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:33,560
 and they are just correct. If you have people who can use them. Right. There is a bit of a learning

671
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:38,520
 curve. There's also a regular curve. There's, there's a 360 degrees of learning curve on those

672
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:45,000
 motherfuckers. Oh, cause there is a circle. Yeah. What else is round your nostril? Do you want some

673
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,160
 cocaine? Oh my God. Oh my God. I walked right into it. Oh my God. This man won't stop offering me

674
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:56,600
 cocaine. So we get on the flight the next morning. We head to the airport the next morning. Uh, we

675
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:01,480
 get through the Lisbon airport, which the Lisbon airport is confusing by the way. If anybody ever

676
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:06,440
 flies through the Lisbon airport, give yourself an extra few minutes to, uh, navigate the Lisbon

677
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,920
 airport. Uh, but we got there. All the air traffic controllers run cocaine.

678
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,040
 You know what, whatever they were doing and they're very clicky, but they show up,

679
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:24,920
 but they show up. They show up. So we get there. We get on the flight. We're going to Philadelphia

680
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,760
 this time. We're not doing new work anymore. We're going to Philadelphia. So we get on the

681
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:34,200
 flight to Philadelphia. By the way, I really appreciated my seatmate, the stranger sitting

682
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:40,840
 next to me. Uh, it was a seven hour flight. She did not speak to me until there was about half an

683
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:46,120
 hour left in that flight. And then we had just a very pleasant conversation for the last half hour

684
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:52,200
 before we left. What a pro. Look at you go. I appreciated that so much. Was this an American

685
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:59,640
 that you were seated next to? Uh, this was an American. Yes. Was it your wife? It was not my

686
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,000
 wife. She was seated on a different row. Oh, you guys, you guys don't fly together? Uh, we,

687
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,720
 we ended up not flying together on that leg. I forget why. I think it was just too full or

688
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:15,640
 something. My, my wife likes to do like some of, you know, like there's a, there's a tier of cheap

689
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:21,480
 seat where you don't choose your, your, your, your seat. And that's right. And you, and you can lose

690
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,720
 that gamble. And it sounds like maybe that's, that's what happened there. That may have happened here

691
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,400
 because SJ did set up these flights. So I'm not entirely sure, but yeah, something happened on

692
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,040
 this one and we weren't sitting together. Did I tell you guys about my return flight from Vegas

693
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:41,720
 last time that I was, are there any dirty, filthy Roma's on there? Not that I could tell, but I did.

694
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,360
 White t-shirts because those were the Roma's. Are Roma's from Italy? Where were Roma's supposed,

695
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:50,280
 supposedly from? What's the culture of Roma? I don't even know the, it's, it's what we used

696
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:59,240
 to call gypsies. Okay. Got it. Romanians. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Uh, thank you. Everybody chiming in.

697
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:04,840
 I go, uh, cause Roma to me, it was like a lot of like Italian places have like Roma as a, as a,

698
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:11,960
 right. Right. They're a small tomato. Yeah. Yeah. They are a small tomato. Well, I I messed up and

699
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:18,360
 didn't get my prebook Southwest early registry thing. So I was pretty late on getting on,

700
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,440
 you were at the end of the line on the plane. So I sat in the middle of two people,

701
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:28,920
 the lady to my right was at the window. She was fine. The guy in the aisle next to me.

702
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:35,560
 Was having issues. Oh no. Cause we were coming out of Vegas. So the air conditioning was up

703
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:43,800
 and coming into Pittsburgh, he was shaking and rocking like he was freezing to death.

704
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,320
 I don't know why he didn't ask for a blanket or something. I don't know. He was having issues

705
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,200
 and he brought an entire sandwich on the flight with him.

706
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:03,320
 Rookie. Rookie. Oh, rookie for sure. For sure. Not an experienced traveler. Uh, smelly enough

707
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:10,760
 that I was like, I, I, I know what you're eating. Yeah. Yeah. He should have, he should have just

708
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,800
 dumped all the innards of the sandwich and hide inside the bread. Like, like Skywalker.

709
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:21,080
 That would have been the move is like to turn that into a tauntaun for your arm, buddy. Oh, you know,

710
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:27,320
 but, uh, no, he, uh, he didn't, but he was, he was shaken, shaken like a leaf. It was strange.

711
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,640
 It was strange. Did you feel like he was going to lose it or do you think it was just done out of,

712
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:39,080
 uh, coldness once or twice? I was kind of, I got a little like, what is happening, bud?

713
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,920
 Oh, you're keeping an eye on him once or twice. I was keeping an eye on him once or twice, but he

714
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:48,040
 didn't, he didn't go completely off the rails. Uh, but I didn't, I didn't sleep that flight at all.

715
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,360
 I was just listening to podcasts. Did you think to offer him a coat like a gentleman? Did you think

716
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:01,400
 to, uh, had I been wearing any extra garments? I might, I may have, but I was, you know, here,

717
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,640
 take my pants. I was just in Vegas, you know, pajama mode. Basically I'm wearing my sweats and,

718
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:15,000
 uh, a t-shirt. I was just ready to go. So, uh, yeah, it was easy peasy. I don't even think I had a

719
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:23,400
 jacket on. Um, yeah, I was just rolling and it's different for men of size. Did you think if he was

720
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:28,600
 maybe rocking, did you think to maybe cradle him, maybe just like support him, lift him up a little

721
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:35,560
 bit? I didn't, I didn't. Ranch Lunk says possibly autism. No, I don't think this was the case. Uh,

722
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:44,040
 he was truly just cold. Oh man. Speaking of autism on my flight home, I watched The Accountant 2.

723
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:52,440
 I watched The Accountant 2 on my flight home. Ben Affleck playing an autistic person made me very

724
01:12:52,440 --> 01:13:03,480
 uncomfortable. I'm so happy. I was watching it going like, this can't be okay. And, uh,

725
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:09,720
 that great actor, is it John Barenthal? Is that his name? I think so. Yeah. The Punisher. Yeah,

726
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:16,600
 he's so good. Yes. And he's his brother. He's his brother. And I was like, thank God he is in this

727
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:24,680
 movie. And this movie was in the middle of seven rewrites and they pressed go. I mean, some of it's

728
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:30,840
 like a, like a romp, like buddy comedy, like, like, like, like, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, was it Will Smith

729
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:37,160
 and, uh, bad boys. Oh, bad boys. Yeah. Some of it has, yeah, a lot of it's like got like bad boy humor

730
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:41,560
 moments. Some of it's like, some of it's like Taylor Shar- like right out of a Taylor Sheridan

731
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:46,920
 show, uh, uh, where they're like, they go into like a honky tonk bar and it's like, they get

732
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,040
 like an old fashioned bar fight. The whole scene in the honky tonk bar is the weirdest scene in cinema.

733
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,920
 It doesn't need to be in it at all. It doesn't make a damn bit of sense. And then they don't show the

734
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,240
 fight sequence, which I'm like, they go for like a gag where like, oh shoot. And then just shows

735
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,440
 guys like coming out of a window and they get in the car and ride off like a Taylor Sheridan show,

736
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,760
 like a Taylor Sheridan. And I was like, and I literally was like, I was like, what, why am I

737
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:15,080
 watching an action movie where you skip the fight sequences? This movie is filled with hyper violence

738
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:23,240
 the entire time and we skip over the bar fight scene. This was like, what is happening? And Ben

739
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:28,760
 Affleck, I guess he like studied a particular kid and has a good relationship with him. And he already

740
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,720
 did this in the accountant one, which I didn't watch because I heard he was playing an autistic

741
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:38,360
 person in the first one. But I love Jon Baranthal. So I was like, wait, you didn't see accountant one?

742
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:42,520
 How did you keep up? How did you keep up in accountant two plot wise, man?

743
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:52,280
 And it is just the strangest. Like it is both like, it is scored like a nineties thriller.

744
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:59,240
 There are parts of it that are like John Wick like, like where it's like this network of

745
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,320
 people that just keep reporting to other people and like an underbelly and both sides have too

746
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:09,480
 much access to like crazy amounts of information. One woman's trying to like, just be like a good

747
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:15,640
 voice in it. Like it's all over the place. It is really... It really is. There is so much going on

748
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:21,160
 at all times in this movie. It's ridiculous. It is a chaotic C plus of a movie.

749
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:31,240
 I not only watched the accountant two, I also watched the Jason Statham vehicle, the Beekeeper.

750
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,080
 Oh, I saw a Beekeeper when it came out. I love Jason Statham.

751
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,560
 Both of these. I was like, these are both very much Matt Donnelly movies.

752
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,320
 But Beekeeper doesn't waver.

753
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:47,560
 No, Beekeeper is a good old... It's Jason Statham just doing Jason Statham stuff.

754
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,520
 By the numbers right through.

755
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,400
 Just what you want.

756
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:54,120
 Hyperviolence. No, they don't take a break for me to feel good. They don't try to make

757
01:15:54,120 --> 01:16:00,040
 me laugh. It is just... You shouldn't have messed with them. He was trying to retire.

758
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,920
 Too bad. He's killing all y'all.

759
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,200
 I'm looking forward to Nobody 2, which apparently is the exact same movie.

760
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

761
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,880
 I love Nobody 1. So yeah, I'll take Nobody 2.

762
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,680
 It was great.

763
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,000
 No, no. I mean, here's the thing. I like the idea of portraying autistic people in mainstream movies.

764
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,500
 Of course.

765
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,760
 We have this thing where we don't like when actors now try to portray different things.

766
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:30,120
 Unless you are blind, you shouldn't play blind, or whatever. All that stuff.

767
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,640
 I don't agree with any of that.

768
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,140
 Yeah.

769
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:37,400
 Ben Affleck is not a transformative actor. He never has been.

770
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,840
 Ben Affleck always plays versions of Ben Affleck that we like him doing.

771
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,360
 Charming guy trying to do good things.

772
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:44,860
 Yeah.

773
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:49,320
 He's not Gary Oldman. He's not like... I don't know.

774
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,200
 What? He's not?

775
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,080
 That's what I mean. There are actors we would give credit to really go and play.

776
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:04,840
 No, you know what? The Gary Oldman. Have you seen the one where he placed a little person on his knees?

777
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,880
 No, no, no, no. I didn't want my point to boomerang so quickly.

778
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,320
 I'm just wrong. I'm just wrong.

779
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:20,280
 Gary Oldman does a whole movie on his knees.

780
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,080
 All right. Forget everything Ben just said. We're going to edit that part out. No big deal.

781
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,200
 Cut out shoes.

782
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,720
 We're editing that whole part out.

783
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,600
 Take a bite.

784
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,320
 Take two.

785
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:36,200
 We don't give Ben Affleck the credit of being a transformative actor.

786
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,400
 I don't even know who. I can't think of anyone right now.

787
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,440
 Like other actors.

788
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:46,680
 Like other actors, but we sometimes allow other actors to be transformative different characters.

789
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,600
 Is it just because we used to do it?

790
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:57,560
 No, I know what that means. I couldn't get it out of my head the entire film.

791
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,240
 Yeah. The whole time, every time he does it, you just go, oh my God,

792
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:05,800
 that's Ben Affleck trying to be autistic. That's all. You're just watching him act

793
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,320
 and going like, oh, how do you feel great about this?

794
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:14,120
 Yeah. Oh, the Gary Oldman movie on his knees is called Tiptoes.

795
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:14,840
 Tiptoes?

796
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:25,000
 According to winners. He's brothers with McConaughey.

797
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:34,680
 And McConaughey is a full-sized man, whereas Gary Oldman plays a smaller man.

798
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:47,160
 And it's outrageous. And McConaughey doesn't like him.

799
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:52,600
 Like he has beef with his brother. It's very strange.

800
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,360
 What kind of beef? Short rib?

801
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:07,480
 Oh my God, Paul's playing a clip and it just shows a split second of Gary Oldman being tiny.

802
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,280
 Doing the thing.

803
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,120
 Oh, that's not great.

804
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,320
 It's the preview.

805
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,080
 Oh my gosh.

806
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:17,720
 So that Paul stops showing this video. I'm going to bookend my Portugal story.

807
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:27,000
 His mom and dad are regular, see? And the mom and dad of the other people, it's just outrageous.

808
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,720
 Anyway, yeah, no, that's horrible.

809
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:39,720
 It's just crazy. But Gary Oldman's, I mean, have you seen True Romance?

810
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,800
 That's a wild swing from Gary Oldman too.

811
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,080
 But I like a lot of his stuff. I think he does.

812
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:47,800
 I do too.

813
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,000
 He takes wild swings.

814
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,800
 Okay, here's an example. What, he played a crazy vampire, right?

815
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,400
 In, what was it, Nosferatu or whatever? Or what was the?

816
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,040
 Dracula.

817
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,600
 Dracula.

818
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,360
 Bram Stoker's Dracula.

819
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,440
 Bram Stoker's Dracula, right? I would want to see Ben Affleck in the same amount of makeup

820
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,960
 doing like a crazy vampire.

821
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,720
 You're absolutely right. He couldn't pull off full makeup Affleck.

822
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:17,080
 Yeah, like he's meant to be just like likable, relatable guy in whatever role he's playing.

823
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,560
 Yeah, he's that Boston guy over there.

824
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,720
 That's why Batman didn't work for him because he's got 80% of it.

825
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,600
 That's why.

826
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:30,440
 Well, I mean, Snyder didn't do him any favors, but he's got 80% of it.

827
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:38,040
 But the Snyder take on Batman was so morose and unhappy.

828
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,560
 And when you introduce him in basically a 9/11 scenario, it's like, where do we go from here?

829
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,880
 9/12.

830
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:52,680
 Well, I mean, it was 9/12. It was Superman causing 9/12, basically.

831
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,160
 Oh, I went and saw the new Superman movie the other day.

832
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:55,400
 Yeah.

833
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,000
 I was so bored.

834
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,680
 Was it? It was boring to you?

835
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,880
 I was just so fucking bored the entire time.

836
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,120
 I saw it.

837
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,280
 I just don't give a shit.

838
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,720
 Animal adaptions went up like 500% after that movie came out.

839
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,560
 Oh, is that true?

840
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,200
 Yeah.

841
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,760
 Because it's all about the super dog.

842
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,680
 Apparently, Krypto's the star.

843
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:18,920
 Yes.

844
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,680
 Yeah, which that credit to James Gunn knowing what he's doing, right?

845
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:28,600
 I agree. They took two really big swings because you have to try to reinvent the wheel a little bit.

846
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,240
 And yet you still have to deliver a blockbuster.

847
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,680
 I thought it was interesting that they started the movie where it would be the start of the third act

848
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,640
 in any other superhero movie. They start the movie in the middle.

849
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,640
 And there's no origin story or whatever.

850
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,080
 Again, I think we pointed out another episode, but none of us had seen it yet.

851
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:51,480
 At one point, he ends up back at his home that he was raised in Kansas and it pans around.

852
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:55,880
 Lois looks around and sees, oh, this is the room that he grew up in.

853
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,600
 He's been so secretive about his life.

854
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:04,360
 And yet here is his home and it pans to a shelf that has a bunch of trophies on it.

855
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:10,360
 And I'm just like, what was Superman doing in high school?

856
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,040
 He just was going ham.

857
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,680
 Just fucking wrecking people in wrestling?

858
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,800
 What, football, basketball, like speech and debate, speech and debate.

859
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,040
 What was he doing?

860
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:28,520
 It's like that moment in The Incredibles where Dash is doing the race.

861
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,400
 Oh yeah, track and field.

862
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,200
 And they're like, slow down, slow down.

863
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,520
 And his parents are like, oh, and he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:39,960
 I was like, what are those trophies for? What the fuck were you doing, Clark?

865
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,480
 Debate club, ranch slugs, that's debate club.

866
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,280
 And maybe you're right. It could have been forensics. Who knows?

867
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,400
 It could have been all trophies for Spirit of the Latin Club.

868
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,000
 You only get little medallions for that.

869
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,500
 No.

870
01:22:53,500 --> 01:23:00,520
 The woman in front of me on the flight was watching, she was also watching a fine film.

871
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,160
 She was watching Speed 2 Cruise Control.

872
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:09,960
 I appreciate this person watching Speed 2 Cruise Control on this plane.

873
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,920
 The same danger as Speed 1, but now in knots.

874
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:18,680
 Now on the boat. Who was that Keanu replacement? What did he end up doing?

875
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,200
 Oh, I forget his name. He had a little run. I forget his name.

876
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,800
 He did. He did.

877
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,680
 Jason Patrick.

878
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,280
 Jason Patrick?

879
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,880
 Yes, Jason Patrick, yes.

880
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:34,840
 Yeah, yeah. Anyway, Jacob, please finish your Portugal story.

881
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,320
 Yeah, so the woman on the flight back, watching this woman watch Speed 2 Cruise Control,

882
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,800
 they serve a meal on the flight back. And I saw the meal and it was some kind of chicken,

883
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,000
 something or something like that. And they had a couple of other options.

884
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,640
 I wasn't especially hungry. So when the flight attendant comes by with the meals,

885
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:59,240
 I just said, "Hey, I don't want the meal. Do you have like a little snacky something though,

886
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,400
 like a bag of chips or some pretzels or something like that?" And she goes, "I do,

887
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,320
 but it'll take me a few minutes." I say, "Oh, no, I'm not in a hurry. No problem at all."

888
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,760
 I make my own pretzels.

889
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,720
 I make my own nacho sauce.

890
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:17,240
 Whatever you get through doing whatever you're doing, no problem. I'll be right here.

891
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:23,080
 And she got a smile and was like, "Great." So she walks away, she finishes up. And then like 10

892
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:31,240
 minutes later, she comes back and has two bags of salt and pepper potato chips and two little bags

893
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:37,880
 of pretzels and hands me those four items. And I go, "Oh, this is great. Thank you so much.

894
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:45,720
 This will last me for the rest of the time. Great. Thank you." And I have my drink and I'm

895
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,920
 happy as a clam. I'm sitting there. I'm watching a little movie.

896
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,440
 Wayne says, "That'll be $73, please."

897
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,160
 Yeah, right. All gratis. All gratis.

898
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:57,660
 Nice.

899
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:05,480
 So I'm sitting there. I'm enjoying that. And then I hear behind me in the road directly behind me,

900
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:13,080
 woman says, "Hey, I never got my chicken." Because I guess they had run out of chicken

901
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,440
 for the meals at some point.

902
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,720
 Ma'am, we're still slapping it, ma'am. We're still slapping it.

903
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,240
 The chicken is being slapped.

904
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,960
 We're slapping it as fast as we can. It's harder to slap at this altitude, you understand.

905
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,600
 And so they had brought over all the plates and everything, all the meals. And then for like two

906
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,320
 or three people right in that area, they had run out of the chicken. And so they had gone to get

907
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:38,120
 more chicken from the galley or whatever and they come back and they serve those people chicken.

908
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:43,080
 And I guess this one woman had missed the chicken on the second round.

909
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:43,580
 Okay.

910
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:50,440
 And so she ate her plate of food and then she was mad that she had not had any chicken.

911
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:56,920
 So here comes the guy cleaning up. He's not even the guy serving food. He's just the cleanup guy.

912
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,720
 So he's coming along. He's cleaning up. He's collecting the garbage. And she says to him

913
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:06,200
 very loudly, and I'm sitting at the window. She is sitting in the window directly behind me.

914
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,640
 And so all I can do, I can't see her. I can just hear her. And she says, look,

915
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:15,880
 I never got my chicken in my meal. And at this point, I thought she was kidding because I was

916
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,600
 like, this is such a ridiculous thing. I think this woman is fooling around.

917
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,240
 You start laughing and clapping. Good bit, ma'am.

918
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,360
 A little bit, a little bit.

919
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:22,920
 Good bit.

920
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,560
 And I was like genuinely smiling and like, oh, this woman's going to do a bit about where she

921
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,520
 yells about not getting chicken now. Nope, wasn't doing a bit.

922
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:35,240
 And by the way, chicken is code for cocaine. I would like cocaine, please.

923
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:39,880
 I can tell you one thing about Portugal is they don't use code words for cocaine.

924
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:46,520
 Under no circumstance will they use code words for cocaine.

925
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,120
 Oh, you thought you were getting cocaine? No, sir. I said chicken. I explicitly said chicken.

926
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,240
 I clearly said chicken.

927
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,960
 I said chicken. I didn't say cocaine.

928
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:59,960
 So she says to this young man flight attendant who is collecting the garbage,

929
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:05,080
 she goes, I never got my chicken. And in exchange for that, you can make it right to me

930
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,400
 by bringing me a bag of potato chips.

931
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,880
 Oh, she wants the same salt content.

932
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:18,520
 That's right. And so he says, miss, I'm just, I'm just picking up the trash right now,

933
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,120
 but the flight attendant will be right back by in a few minutes and you can get,

934
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,800
 you can get the potato chips from her. That is not good enough.

935
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,760
 Of course not.

936
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,200
 She starts raising her voice.

937
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,080
 Indignation.

938
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,840
 Over the ocean.

939
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,240
 People get crazy on airplanes.

940
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:38,200
 She is raising her voice about how she wants some potato chips.

941
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:44,120
 And he says, actually miss, and again, not the flight attendant,

942
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:48,280
 the guy picking up trash, he's holding a trash bag, picking up people's garbage here.

943
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:54,840
 And he says, actually miss, I'm not sure if we have potato chips on this flight.

944
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,000
 They actually forgot to load the potato chips.

945
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,960
 Oh my God.

946
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:00,760
 On this flight.

947
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,000
 And now, but right ahead of her, there's a man eating chips.

948
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,280
 And so she says, oh, no, no, no, this guy right here.

949
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,760
 I assume she's pointing at the back of my head.

950
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:11,260
 Yeah.

951
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:15,960
 This guy right here got a bag of potato chips.

952
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,320
 Who is this royal prince that you pamper in front of me while negating my chicken?

953
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,400
 Everyone knows chips equals chicken.

954
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,320
 Now, at this point, I had eaten my bag of potato chips.

955
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,200
 Just one bag.

956
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,680
 Well, I had eaten the potato chips.

957
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,000
 They brought out the two little mini bags.

958
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,960
 You ate both the bag.

959
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,360
 They were gone.

960
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,040
 So I'd already eaten both bags of potato chips.

961
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,720
 So when you heard him say that, were you like, gulp?

962
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,880
 Did you know before she even pointed you out?

963
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,560
 I was trying as hard as I could to sink into my seat.

964
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:55,320
 Because I was like, this nice flight attendant did me a solid,

965
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:01,240
 brought me some nice salty snacks to enjoy on here so I wouldn't be eating the airplane chicken.

966
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,400
 Clearly contraband snacks.

967
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,440
 Maybe.

968
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:10,040
 Well, I found out later they had a few bags left over, but they had, in fact, not been resupplied.

969
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,360
 So they didn't have enough bags of chips for the entire plane.

970
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:12,600
 Goodness sake.

971
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,080
 But they had like a few bags of chips around.

972
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,840
 Ma'am, I will baby bird those chips into your mouth.

973
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:25,560
 So he looks at my tray table there.

974
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,200
 And he sees a bag of pretzels on there.

975
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,000
 And he goes, oh, miss, he doesn't have chips.

976
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,200
 He just has pretzels.

977
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:32,600
 Oh, no.

978
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,800
 Oh, shoot.

979
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,400
 This guy's digging it even further.

980
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,000
 He's only trying to help.

981
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,840
 He was trying to help so hard.

982
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,160
 And I just wanted to be like, shut the fuck up.

983
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,920
 Move along.

984
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,800
 Stop talking.

985
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,120
 Just stop it.

986
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,760
 You are literally a garbage person.

987
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,400
 Get out of here.

988
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,080
 Go.

989
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,520
 Get out of here, trash man.

990
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,680
 Do your thing.

991
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,840
 But this woman, you're not helping.

992
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,640
 You're trying to help.

993
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,120
 And I appreciate that you're trying to help, but you're not.

994
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,960
 Please, please continue on with your day.

995
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,160
 This guy also has headphones.

996
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,200
 Do you want his headphones?

997
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,200
 He also has-- what else?

998
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:06,760
 He's got a hat.

999
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,640
 You want to wear his hat?

1000
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:15,320
 So he says, well, miss, there's a button there right in front of you.

1001
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,760
 If you hit that button, that's the flight attendant call button.

1002
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,360
 And she can come get you whatever you need.

1003
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,680
 No, no, no.

1004
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,360
 She goes, that's not good enough.

1005
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,960
 That is not good enough for her.

1006
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,240
 She goes, no, no, no.

1007
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,920
 I just need a bag of chips.

1008
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,440
 And I would like them right now.

1009
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:30,920
 Oh, boy.

1010
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:35,320
 So finally, this poor guy flags down one of the flight attendants.

1011
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,320
 So strange to be demanding like this alternate-- like,

1012
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,000
 I need you specifically to change the way you do things.

1013
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:43,480
 That's it.

1014
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:49,080
 And so finally, the flight attendant who had helped me out comes back over.

1015
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:54,040
 And this woman is now-- she's not quite yelling.

1016
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,000
 But she's yelling.

1017
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,680
 She is what we in Couth society would refer to as yelling.

1018
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:05,960
 This guy got a bag-- you brought this guy a bag of chips.

1019
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,400
 Do you know this guy?

1020
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,000
 She's now questioning the flight attendant.

1021
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,880
 Do you know this guy?

1022
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,080
 Do you know him?

1023
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,080
 Is he someone that I should know?

1024
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,600
 Because he got chips.

1025
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,880
 No problem.

1026
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,760
 This bitch.

1027
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,720
 And she keeps on and keeps on.

1028
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,440
 And finally, flight attendant comes back over and goes, hey,

1029
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,200
 I found a bag of potato chips.

1030
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:28,920
 Uh, lucky that, you know, comes back and tries to, like, defuse the whole situation.

1031
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:29,400
 Right.

1032
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,360
 And goes, like, hey, good news, everybody.

1033
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,360
 I found a bag of potato chips.

1034
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,200
 This bag is just for you, ma'am.

1035
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,800
 Enjoy your bag of potato chips.

1036
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,080
 Enjoy the rest of your flight.

1037
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:44,040
 I would have loved for it to be over at that minute.

1038
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,080
 She is amped, right?

1039
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,200
 Like, she will not--

1040
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,320
 She's on.

1041
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:49,640
 Right.

1042
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,680
 And she's going.

1043
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,840
 So now the flight attendants drop everything off.

1044
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,200
 They've picked up the garbage.

1045
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,600
 I've now broken open one of my bag of pretzels.

1046
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:01,960
 I'm making eye contact with the flight attendant while she was there and just mouthing, I'm sorry.

1047
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,600
 I am sorry.

1048
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,360
 I didn't mean to start all this.

1049
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,640
 I don't know these people.

1050
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:11,640
 I'm just trying to do anything to distance myself from these people

1051
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,160
 in the eyes of this flight attendant who, again, did a nice thing for me.

1052
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,200
 Unlike Enterprise, where we were joking,

1053
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,240
 you should have honestly turned around and be like, "Do you know who I am?"

1054
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:26,440
 Do you know how lucky you are to be in my airspace?

1055
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:33,560
 And then this woman gave me the perfect bookend for my entire Portugal vacation

1056
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,240
 without even knowing it.

1057
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,720
 The flight attendant walked away.

1058
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,560
 The flight attendants have now walked away.

1059
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,200
 And now she is just talking to her seatmates.

1060
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,840
 She's talking to two other people who she did not know before this flight started.

1061
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,320
 Oh, God.

1062
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,080
 And she's now loudly talking to them and laughing.

1063
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,120
 And she goes, "Ow!

1064
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:55,720
 They didn't know who they were messing with.

1065
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:01,480
 As soon as I saw this guy get chips, I knew that I was going to get chips.

1066
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,080
 And you don't even know.

1067
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,240
 You see, I'm from Jersey.

1068
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,480
 And in Jersey, I get what I want."

1069
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:14,040
 No, in Jersey, you cry and call your brother for help.

1070
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:19,240
 No.

1071
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:23,960
 Of course this woman's from Jersey and is now going to loudly proclaim it.

1072
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,480
 I wish I was in a flight.

1073
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,120
 I'd be like, "Please stop speaking for all of us.

1074
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,240
 Please stop doing that."

1075
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,160
 Stop speaking for any of us.

1076
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,120
 It was terrible.

1077
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:34,680
 Oh, boy.

1078
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,720
 It was so bad.

1079
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:41,640
 And I just looked at my seatmate at one point when she started talking to me.

1080
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,040
 And I just said, "Do you remember when air travel used to be pleasant?"

1081
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,000
 It was just nice.

1082
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,160
 I believe she deserved a slow clap.

1083
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:53,160
 I think the hands from your seat going right up and just slow clapping.

1084
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,600
 Just above my head so she could just see my hands.

1085
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,400
 Exactly.

1086
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,280
 Good job.

1087
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,720
 She wouldn't even get it.

1088
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,880
 I was like, "I cannot fight with this woman."

1089
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:06,040
 I picture her telling this story to anyone after she lands,

1090
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,240
 just watching whoever she's talking to just eyes glaze over with like,

1091
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,560
 "What are you talking about?"

1092
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:16,600
 You were in some psychotic state where you turn chips into currency.

1093
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:23,080
 And you could not get off your own emotional high point.

1094
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:27,960
 You were over the Atlantic Ocean and you had a breakdown over potato chips.

1095
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:33,080
 And something in your brain just said, "Win," instead of assessing a situation for what it was.

1096
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:36,200
 You just had to find a way to feel like you were winning.

1097
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,040
 And she had just had a tray of food.

1098
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,760
 There was a salad on there.

1099
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,200
 There were side dishes.

1100
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,920
 She had had the whole meal except for the chicken.

1101
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,440
 But it was not a small amount of food.

1102
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,280
 It was a full-on meal that they served on this.

1103
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:58,600
 It was bizarre until she said she was from Jersey and then I understood all of it.

1104
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:04,280
 I married a California girl, so what can I say?

1105
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:09,000
 Apparently, she also spends part of the year in Miami.

1106
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,360
 And believe me, she knows how to get shit done in Miami too.

1107
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,680
 So there was cocaine involved.

1108
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:18,680
 I knew this was a cocaine story one way or the other.

1109
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,480
 She doing that cocaine?

1110
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,960
 No, no, that's not how you do cocaine, Jacob.

1111
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,600
 Cocaine, cocaine!

1112
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,360
 Right in the vein, that's the rhyme.

1113
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,520
 Cocaine, cocaine, right in my vein.

1114
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,320
 Jim Dandy.

1115
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,040
 Go, Jim Dandy.

1116
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,400
 What the fuck are you here for?

1117
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,920
 Who asked you to come?

1118
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,640
 What are you doing?

1119
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,080
 Nobody knows!

1120
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,360
 Lovely, Jacob.

1121
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:44,840
 Well, that's it.

1122
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,960
 Lovely, Jacob.

1123
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:46,440
 It was great.

1124
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,240
 It was a great week.

1125
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:47,960
 Glad to be back.

1126
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,480
 Glad to be back on the old scoops here.

1127
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,280
 This is great.

1128
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,160
 It was nice.

1129
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,200
 It was good to be back.

1130
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,480
 Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

1131
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,680
 We ran out of time.

1132
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,480
 We didn't have it.

1133
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,840
 We don't have any Jack vs. Nerd time.

1134
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,480
 We just talked.

1135
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,560
 We'll be back here.

1136
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:05,400
 For anyone joining us live, we'll be recording again on Friday

1137
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,160
 for the Monday episode, as always.

1138
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,280
 And so you can join us there.

1139
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,880
 I was going to ask you guys if we can go an hour early on Friday.

1140
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,320
 Yes.

1141
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:13,640
 Yeah.

1142
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:14,360
 Great.

1143
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,520
 We'll send that invite out to the patrons.

1144
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,160
 Yes.

1145
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:17,640
 Yeah.

1146
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,240
 There'll be an hour earlier on Friday.

1147
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,360
 Because I'm heading off to Arizona.

1148
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,360
 So if you're getting this, you can come tonight.

1149
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,440
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday in Mesa, Arizona.

1150
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,200
 7 o'clock shows at Mystique, the Magic Experience.

1151
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,080
 It's no dinner.

1152
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,240
 It's just me, an hour long show at 7 o'clock.

1153
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,240
 Come out and check it out.

1154
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,640
 And the reason I'm asking to go early is because I am bringing my sons with me to Arizona.

1155
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:38,520
 Oh, nice.

1156
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:45,720
 Yeah. And so we'll get out and we'll do other stuff during the day and have fun with my kiddos.

 Sound like everybody to me.

1165
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,080
 Maybe everyone.

1166
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,920
 You made quite a case for someone who's unsure.

1167
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:15,800
 Okay.

1168
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,200
 Yeah, yeah.

1169
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,040
 But of course, this podcast is going to be possible with the generous people

 who've been supporting us on Patreon.

1171

1172
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,840
 I think we appreciate that.

1173
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,120
 As we head into both Scoop Fest and trying to find a new churn at the same time,

1174
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,800
 a lot of pills are becoming due.

1175
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:36,840
 And so people supporting us there, we will be finishing a revamp of our Patreon

1176
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:40,360
 with some adjustments heading into this month, heading into August.

1177
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,160
 And we'll announce all that when it's all settled.

01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,120

01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,840
 I'm the only one that's really enjoying

1341
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:31,880
 all of you lovely people in the chat.

1342
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,480
 I find seeing laughing faces

1343
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,840
 when I make jokes to be a burden.

1344
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,840
 Yes, yes.

1345
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,640
 Well, lucky you.

1346
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,840
 But thank you, each and every one of you

1347
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,880
 who are patrons.

1348
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:42,920
 We really appreciate it.

1349
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,880
 Couldn't do the show without you.

1350
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:44,760
 It's true. Being a patron

1351
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,160
 gets you invited onto this live recording.

1352
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,040
 And I wouldn't have known

1353
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,400
 to make that cocaine or a runner,

1354
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:50,520
 except I kept seeing people laugh

1355
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,080
 when I did it.

1356
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,280
 So there you go.

1357
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,800
 There you go.

1358
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,440
 That's how it works.

1359
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,640
 But yeah, Scoopfest tickets

1360
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:56,280
 are still on sale.

1361
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,120
 Go to scoopfest.com and check that out.

1362
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,720
 And we have a hotel discount as well.

1363
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,800
 So call the Orleans and demand

1364
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,720
 to be part of the discount block of rooms

1365
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,320
 with a discount code of...

1366
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,360
 Paul.

1367
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,000
 Superman.

1368
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,280
 Catwoman.

1369
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,040
 Invisible Jet.

1370
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:14,520
 25.

1371
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,840
 Catwoman again.

1372
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,480
 Right?

1373
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,040
 I think that's right.

1374
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:20,760
 That sounds right.

1375
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,920
 And if this code doesn't work out,

1376
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,200
 just tell them Scoopfest.

1377
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,280
 Just call the Orleans.

1378
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,400
 Tell them Scoopfest.

1379
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,040
 It'll work out.

1380
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,960
 But please do make an effort

1381
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,240
 to come out to Scoopfest.

1382
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,760
 You're going to have a great time.

1383
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,960
 If you're on the fence at all about it,

1384
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,080
 get off that fence.

1385
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,520
 Talk to some Scoops.

1386
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,520
 There are lots of groups.

1387
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,240
 Oh yeah, Flash.

1388
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:41,960
 I missed Flash.

1389
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,240
 Thanks, Big Sexy.

1390
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,920
 There's...

1391
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,320
 Yeah, what's Jeff saying?

1392
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,400
 If you don't have a ticket,

1393
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,400
 you need to reconsider your life choices.

1394
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,120
 Jeff is right.

1395
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,960
 Listen to Jeff.

1396
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,480
 He knows what he's talking about.

1397
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,760
 Reconsider your life choices

1398
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,320
 if you're not already coming to Scoopfest.

1399
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,480
 It is a wonderful, wonderful time.

1400
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,840
 We have a great time.

1401
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,520
 Our community has a great time.

1402
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,400
 And if you come once,

1403
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,280
 you're going to want to come again.

1404
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,840
 But that kind of holds true for everything.

1405
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:13,000
 But yeah, please, please come on out to Scoopfest.

1406
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,200
 SCFI 25C.

1407
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:16,920
 There we go.

1408
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,280
 Mikey Newman confirmed.

1409
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,640
 So we'll be having movies with Mikey.

1410
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,000
 We'll be hosting our trivia battles.

1411
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,200
 He's excited that we're doing four battles this year.

1412
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,720
 He's so good.

1413
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,760
 Just made Travel Registries,

1414
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,360
 one of our other special guests.

1415
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,480
 I'm very excited about it.

1416
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,440
 We have pretty exciting...

1417
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,640
 So many special guests,

1418
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,920
 so many special gifts,

1419
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,600
 so many special things going on.

1420
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,080
 It's always greater than the sum of its parts.

1421
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:43,720
 And it becomes this really special thing.

1422
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,880
 We are eternally grateful

1423
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,280
 and always surprised by how cool it ends up.

1424
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,400
 Someone reached out to figure out

1425
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,600
 technically how to make

1426
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,080
 Paul's Hollywood Squares graphic work.

1427
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,280
 And so we're excited about that.

1428
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:58,200
 I still want to do like really basic cardboard...

1429
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:01,160
 I think that's fine.

1430
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:01,720
 Yes.

1431
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,640
 But we'll see how it goes.

1432
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:04,920
 We'll figure it out.

1433
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,680
 But it's going to be exciting.

1434
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,120
 So yeah, come on out to Scoopfest.

1435
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,720
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

1436
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,680
 Stay safe out there.

1437
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,600
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1438
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,240
 We'll see you soon.

1439
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:45,240
 See ya.
