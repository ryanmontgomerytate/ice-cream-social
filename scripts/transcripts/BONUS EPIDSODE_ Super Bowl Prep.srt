1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to. Great, let's go!

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:37,080
 It's a bonus episode! Thank you to the Patreons! We didn't play the theme, but this is the Sporty McBall Things Considered. Oh yeah, it's time for the Sporty McBall Things Considered ice cream social bonus episode with Justin and Mitzi! It's all of us, we're all here at Justin River Young, it's Mitzi, Paul, Matt, and Jacob! It's gonna be crazy!

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,000
 Oh hell yeah! It's our Super Bowl special!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,140
 It's our Super Bowl special! Jacob, you really just summed it all up, I don't know how we could possibly do a better intro than that, but um...

5
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,900
 I mean honestly, I think we just have to go home now, I think we're kind of done. Yeah.

6
00:00:50,900 --> 00:01:05,300
 But just summing up a little more, with a little more length. We of course are beneficially, we benefit from being friends with our famous Vegas odds maker. So Mitzi is here in the studio, he handles all the things.

7
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,980
 Joining us of course is politics, politics, politics host, Justin Robert Young. And that's because...

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,700
 If people don't hate sports enough, let's add politics into the fold, because that'll definitely keep it going.

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:31,460
 That's my day job, but mostly I spend my time bullshitting about sports in a group chat with everybody in this show, except for Paul.

10
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,500
 Paul for whatever reason has not rated an invite to the group chat, how does that make you feel Paul?

11
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:54,380
 It makes me feel good, because I purposely boycotted all NFL stuff this season, because of the Aaron Rodgers going on to the Steelers thing, I was just like, well, there's nothing keeping me watching the local games, so I'm not gonna watch any of it.

12
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:05,360
 And I think I've been proven right, as more and more it becomes crystal clear that everything's a fucking setup, and it's all scripted from the beginning.

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:17,300
 So yeah, that's it. They definitely wanted a backup quarterback in the finals of the NHL season instead of Josh Allen.

14
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:33,040
 That is the correct answer, because it is the greatest act of love that the four of us can have for you, that we don't bother you with the inane bullshit that we put in there about the minutiae of day-to-day sports, it would only pollute your life and we keep it with pride.

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,380
 I can't imagine Paul being on the thread where we were debating Notre Dame's inclusion in the college football playoffs.

16
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,160
 See, this is what's funny, the breakdown of NBA trade analysis right now.

17
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,580
 I'm all for nerdy minutiae breaking point of how many games I can take the under on in college football, like that's mostly what we talk about.

18
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,980
 Yeah, you've got a longer under streak than the Taker had WrestleMania victories.

19
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,740
 So, dude, it did me well this season, though, until the playoffs, that was a good thing to note.

20
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,680
 It's just my nerd nerddoms don't flare up as constantly as sport does.

21
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,820
 Sport is just a constant festering wound of bullshit with my thing.

22
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,980
 It's like, oh, once every 10 years, a He-Man movie happens.

23
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,100
 Once every once every six months, a new toy line comes out.

24
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,580
 That's it. Yep. And there's still plenty of vitriol and hate with that.

25
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,060
 Believe you, trust me. Yeah, but no, it's just talk about himself.

26
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,420
 No, I don't get it. I don't get it. I'm all love right now.

27
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,860
 I it is more good. It is we he fans be eaten good right now.

28
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,260
 More importantly, though, is that we are gathered here because our scoops who don't like sports are still invited to Super Bowl parties.

29
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,300
 So we like to write them up to date with things they can keep track of and stuff.

30
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,420
 It's a Mitzi in the past. We've had you save the crazier bets to the end.

31
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,540
 I actually think I want to front load this and then so we can get more nerdier as we go on.

32
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,340
 All right. We can do that. We'll do let's just do the game prediction first and then we'll go into the fun stuff.

33
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,300
 We'll go back to the normal kind of game. So I didn't do a lot of crazy player prop stuff or anything this year that not that might not be great with everybody.

34
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,380
 Most of the stuff is pretty general. Should be acceptable for most parties.

35
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,380
 So just a great job prepping for this episode and we appreciate it.

36
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,860
 Yes. All right, gentlemen, let's just start it off.

37
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,100
 We're going to go straight up. First of all, we need to pick the Seattle Seahawks or the New England Patriots.

38
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,820
 The Patriots are technically the home team, but the Seahawks are four and a half point favorites.

39
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,500
 The game is being played in San Francisco, so it is a neutral site.

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,340
 OK, are we picking against the spread or just picking straight up picking against the spread?

41
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,980
 We always pick against the spread. Great. We're adults.

42
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,100
 I am definitely go with Seattle and the spread.

43
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,900
 No problem. You had to land four and a half for Matt.

44
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,820
 I think Seattle is going to believe in Sam Darnold.

45
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,460
 Oh, more than anything, I think his name and he appears.

46
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,900
 I think even Sam Darnold, I believe I was brought up right.

47
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,740
 My dad always said fifth time's a charm and I was on his football team.

48
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,940
 And so I figured this is the one five is my lucky number for folks who do not know.

49
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,740
 This is something that you can take into your Super Bowl parties that will get a laugh

50
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,380
 or you will learn people something and you can get credit for it.

51
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,060
 But Sam Darnold was once most famous as a highly drafted

52
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,660
 quarterback for a graphic that was shown during an ESPN broadcast,

53
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,740
 which said that he was out for mono.

54
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,380
 That's right. You can look that up.

55
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,300
 And they said out and they had him for whatever reason, doing like the motion

56
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,380
 graphics that they have all the players record at the beginning of the season

57
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,700
 where they're doing like kind of badass shit.

58
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,860
 And so it was like a slow motion of him pointing like at you.

59
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,820
 This is out for mono.

60
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,540
 That was what he was most famous for, because his career on the field was disastrous.

61
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,860
 He bounces around the league, has a great season with Mitzis, Minnesota Vikings.

62
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,940
 But because Mitzul is not allowed to be happy, they trade him away

63
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,940
 and they let him go out indefinitely for mono-nucleosis.

64
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,020
 And the barrel down the gun is just pointing straight down the lens.

65
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,100
 He's sick looking. Only you can prevent mono-nucleosis.

66
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,580
 I mean, that's what he used to be the most known for.

67
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,180
 Right. All right. And now he's in the Super Bowl and he's been favored by five points.

68
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,180
 Honestly, it was a more fun time when that's what he was known for.

69
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,260
 It was a better time, I think, in America. Hilarious.

70
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,500
 Between that and seeing ghosts, he was all sorts of good.

71
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,900
 I'm with you though, Matt. As a failure.

72
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,900
 Wait, he saw ghosts? Seahawks and four and a half, I'll take it.

73
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,700
 Was this another thing, Mitzi? Was he also a ghost inventor?

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,420
 This is what did his career with the Jets.

75
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,420
 What sealed his fate as a Jets quarterback was the Patriots destroyed him so much

76
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,420
 in the game that he goes, "Oh my God, I'm seeing ghosts out there."

77
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,340
 And it was caught by NFL Films. It was put out as a clip.

78
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:19,340
 On a live mic, yeah. And then they just cut to late-night footage of Gettysburg.

79
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:26,340
 With the Minutemen traipsing across the field eerily on their last march.

80
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,340
 They just intercut it with bedknots and broomsticks.

81
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,340
 That was scary back in the day. That was scary. That was some good shit.

82
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,340
 Angela Lansbury was a scary biatch.

83
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,340
 Angela Lansbury put the fear of the Lord in you. Is she still alive?

84
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,340
 No. Are you sure?

85
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,340
 She died. I'm pretty sure she died.

86
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,340
 I'm just getting word. There is still some good fucking left in her.

87
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,340
 Put her on the microwave. She'll be fine.

88
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,340
 So Matt and Jacob are both on Seattle.

89
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,340
 Murdersheets, grope.

90
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,340
 Cabot Cove, Maine, if it were a real place, would officially be the most murderous city in the country.

91
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
 That's what they called her, hoo-hah.

92
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,340
 And part of New England.

93
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:28,340
 All right. So I hesitate to be chalk here with you guys because I do also like the Seahawks giving four and a half, mostly because I don't believe in the Patriots.

94
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,340
 I think they have looked like dog shit for two straight weeks and it has only been blizzards that have saved their ass.

95
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:42,340
 And CJ Stroud, who decided to have a Richie Tannenbaum style fucking panic attack and melt his career down.

96
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,340
 That's no, that blizzard game was incredible.

97
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:56,340
 That blizzard game. I mean, like the second one, the AFC championship or when it was crystal clear in the third quarter.

98
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,340
 And then the fourth quarter looked like the ninth circle of hell.

99
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,340
 But here's my problem. And here's what I don't know.

100
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:16,340
 I don't know if the New England defense, which has also been very good, is just going to turn the ball over four times with Sam Darnold.

101
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,340
 And Sam Darnold is going to his carriage is going to turn into a pumpkin.

102
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,340
 And we're all going to be like, what the fuck? Why did the entire world bet on Sam Darnold?

103
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,340
 And it's only going to be Mitzi's employer laughing their way to the back.

104
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,340
 This is the correct Monday morning quarterbacking breakdown of this game.

105
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,340
 Yes. Yeah. And yeah.

106
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,340
 And so so I don't I have made several bets on this game already.

107
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:50,340
 But I have not bet on the game outright because I don't know whether or not the New England money line is the thing to sprinkle.

108
00:09:50,340 --> 00:10:00,340
 If you think that they can win outright, which I think any game, anybody, any two teams that are in the Super Bowl, you could you can make the argument that they can win the game.

109
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:09,340
 The nine out of the last ten underdogs have four and a half points or more have covered.

110
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
 OK. Yeah.

111
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,340
 So I don't know. Maybe it's maybe it's a field goal.

112
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,340
 Something like that. Four and a half is a lot. It's a lot. I like a lot more of the props than I like the game itself.

113
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:30,340
 OK. But just move forward. You're at you're at you're at Seattle. You're you're you're fuck. Fuck. OK, fine. I'll I'll take New England in the points.

114
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:39,340
 I hate myself. I hate my life. I hate everything because I hate there's not a team other than the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens that I hate more than the New England Patriots.

115
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:49,340
 Like and mostly because the the Ravens fans, I can sit down and I can drink with a Ravens fan and we can we can talk about games for years and we can share times where it went good for me.

116
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,340
 It went good for them. The Browns fans, I just have pity for.

117
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,340
 Like I there's only so much. Yeah. Like the slash the tires on the short bus and feel good about yourself.

118
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,340
 But like the New England Patriots, I want to move on with that metaphor.

119
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,340
 How many times is it for you when it comes to the Browns?

120
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:22,340
 I'll let you know when I find it less fun. But when it comes to the New England Patriots, the there are a few people on Earth that deserve pain more than Boston.

121
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:34,340
 OK, OK. They are arrogant, angry, low born people that deserve nothing but misery and pain.

122
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:44,340
 In fact, there are times where I've thought about the city of Boston and I'm like, would it be worth it to cancel the American experiment just so they would be sad?

123
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:55,340
 And it takes me longer than I would like to admit to come to eventually saying that, yes, the United States of America should exist if it means the pleasure of Boston, even though Boston is happy about it.

124
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,340
 Hey, Jacob, put a time mark on this right now. I forgot to put on my microphone until this moment.

125
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:09,340
 Oh, great. Were you recording the Twitter, the zoom? Yeah, yeah, you know, I've got it. Good.

126
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:17,340
 Anyway, do you have a do you have a lean on this one? I'll just go with the Seahawks because that's a she was boyfriend.

127
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:30,340
 I'm going to go with the Pats because I am in every Super Bowl world as an oddsmaker, you will be rooting for the favorite to win, but not cover because the public either takes the favorite laying the points or the underdog on the money line.

128
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,340
 So we would like to take it to lose by like a field goal. Right. So that was already world.

129
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,340
 We have our total for the game over under a forty five and a half.

130
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,340
 Could be this is right about a little higher than most Super Bowl or a little lower than most Super Bowls, but still a decent total.

131
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,340
 So forty five and a half is the number. Well, let's start with Paul this time.

132
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:59,340
 Paul, you got to lean on this. I'll go over because that's what America wants right now. They want blood in the in the water.

133
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:05,340
 They want to see big numbers, big gains, big losses, no way big, no way.

134
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:11,340
 Stop. And they'd probably be really happy if one team is is that like 60 and the other teams like to.

135
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,340
 But yeah, I'm going for it.

136
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,340
 Jacob, you got one on this. I think it's going to be over.

137
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:25,340
 I have not been impressed by by either defense, really. I think we're going to see some points.

138
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:33,340
 Justin, you know where I'm going.

139
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,340
 I'm going to get the fucking under both these defenses are really, really good.

140
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:42,340
 I know it's more pleasure for betting for less points than you like nobody.

141
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,340
 Inept football team, a football game than you.

142
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:56,340
 There is nothing as pleasurable as watching a college football game where a bunch of 18 year olds fuck up and being happy about it.

143
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:05,340
 It feels so good just to watch 20 year old kids drop the ball when they really want to try to catch it and just being delighted.

144
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,340
 And they're so sad. Oh, they're so sad.

145
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,340
 I am. I'm also going to go with under.

146
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,340
 I think I think Seattle knows how to play D against the Patriots.

147
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,340
 And I believe Seattle will also turn the ball over.

148
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,340
 So I imagine a muddy, muddy game is what I'm predicting under 20, 27 points.

149
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,340
 That's what the L.A. Rams hung on Seattle two weeks ago.

150
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,340
 Yeah, yeah. The Seattle Rams.

151
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,340
 Do you want to go over the Rams receivers versus the Patriots receivers?

152
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,340
 Oh, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt.

153
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
 I'm just saying they're going to score a little bit.

154
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,340
 Have receivers. I didn't know that.

155
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,340
 I'm also on the under train. I think it's going to be a tight game.

156
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,340
 I think both defenses will show up to probably be a couple of turnovers.

157
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,340
 And I think it's going to be like a 17 to 20 ish kind of a below 40 game.

158
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,340
 So I might even take an alternate under if I'm feeling super, super flying about it.

159
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,340
 Speaking of speaking of of the Patriots receivers,

160
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:14,340
 I don't know whether or not the schedule is going to allow for Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors to be at the game in Santa Clara.

161
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,340
 But if Chef Curry is in the building, I expect Stephon Diggs,

162
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:25,340
 as he is with many chefs, to get probably too aggressive.

163
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,340
 Yeah, they are in there in L.A. on Saturday and home on Monday.

164
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,340
 So they will probably be probably be able to make the game.

165
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,340
 I don't know if they'll be in attendance, but he would be able to make it.

166
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
 All right. Something to keep in mind.

167
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,340
 I haven't seen that on the list of crazy ass who will be attendance props.

168
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,340
 He hasn't been listed. So all right.

169
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,340
 And then we will go with a national anthem length.

170
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,340
 It is Charlie Perr or Pew.

171
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
 I don't know how to pronounce his last name.

172
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
 Yeah, yeah, Charlie. OK.

173
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
 OK, I must have that misspelled then.

174
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,340
 But the over under is at one hundred and twenty four and a half seconds.

175
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
 So here's the thing.

176
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,340
 Most of the time you have a national anthem prop.

177
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,340
 It's because the person has some national anthem at another event.

178
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
 This person has not.

179
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,340
 They only played it on piano once for an event.

180
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
 We have no bearings.

181
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,340
 This guy likes to hold notes out or not hold notes out that that.

182
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,340
 That there's no historical legacy which makes handicapping this an adventure.

183
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,340
 And it seems high. That number seems high to me.

184
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
 That's a long anthem.

185
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,340
 Do we know what the what the length was last year?

186
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,340
 No, I think it was right at one.

187
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
 Nineteen and a half or one twenty somewhere in there.

188
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,340
 I can't remember on top of my head, but it was right around that one.

189
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
 It's right around that two minute mark is usually where it lands.

190
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
 So right.

191
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
 I tend to always bet over on this.

192
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:47,340
 And so I'm going to pump my own breaks and I'm going to go under on the anthem.

193
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,340
 I'm also going to go under Putes or pews singing style.

194
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
 I've always thought is a little bit more clipped.

195
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,340
 Like he's not a like Ed Sheeran like, you know, like being big voice guy.

196
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
 I'm sorry, Justin.

197
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
 He's not like a what?

198
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,340
 I'm sorry, Justin. My headphones are cutting out.

199
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,340
 What are you saying?

200
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,340
 Ray Romano took over here.

201
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,340
 You know, Ed Sheeran, big, tall, full of hair.

202
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,340
 You know, definitely graying.

203
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
 Yeah.

204
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,340
 So I'm going to go under.

205
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,340
 I think he's going to sing a kind of hipster for the Superbowl.

206
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
 A little bit of a hipster version of the national anthem.

207
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
 What's the what's the time on this one?

208
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,340
 Over under one twenty one twenty four and a half.

209
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,340
 I think I'm going to go over.

210
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
 I think I'm going to go over.

211
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,340
 Last year, John Baptiste did a minute fifty nine.

212
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
 Yeah.

213
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,340
 Oh, but you know, Baptiste.

214
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,340
 I felt like he did a pretty clipped version of it, though.

215
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
 I didn't think he did a terribly long version.

216
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
 I don't remember him doing a long version of it.

217
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
 Let's stop pretending.

218
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,340
 Let's stop pretending like we can remember in detail, Baptiste's anthem.

219
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
 Yeah, exactly.

220
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
 What are we doing?

221
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,340
 It's been a week or two since I've watched it.

222
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,340
 So I'm not exactly sure.

223
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
 I'm going to be on the over as well.

224
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,340
 I think we're do a very embellished national anthem.

225
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,340
 We haven't had him in a while, so I think we're good for a few extra.

226
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
 Not lying.

227
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,340
 By the way, he's a huge tick tock guy.

228
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,340
 So so there is the chance that he is going to do a thing so he can be a meme

229
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,340
 on the tick tock on the tick tock.

230
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,340
 I say what's the next shout out to the amount of scoops that have stuck around

231
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,340
 for this recording.

232
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,340
 This is pretty impressive to have this gallery that we have.

233
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,340
 Paul, do you have a lean on that?

234
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:57,340
 No, no.

235
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,340
 So I'm just objecting.

236
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,340
 Will not bet on the length of the national anthem, a bridge too far.

237
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
 I respect it.

238
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,340
 And I respect it.

239
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,340
 Well, Paul is taking Paul is taking an Ian of standing from this one.

240
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,340
 What I'm thinking is maybe they want it when it comes to betting the length of the national anthem.

241
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,340
 Paul is out indefinitely.

242
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,340
 I think they might find a way to stop it.

243
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,340
 Well, then that would be over.

244
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,340
 If Paul, we're going to put if anthem is interrupted, Paul gets an extra point.

245
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
 That's what I'm talking about.

246
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,340
 That's what I'm calling for.

247
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
 Does not finish.

248
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,340
 Paul is DNF.

249
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,340
 The most skilled prediction of the entire super bowl, coin toss, head or tails, tails, baby.

250
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
 It never fails.

251
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,340
 Now we've discovered there's like many ways to bet on the coin toss, right?

252
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
 It's like, will they call heads?

253
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
 Will they call tails?

254
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
 Will there be heads with details?

255
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
 There's what the coin toss will be.

256
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,340
 There's what the coin toss is called.

257
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,340
 There's a team that wins the coin toss.

258
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,340
 There's will the team that wins the coin toss opt to take or receive or defer bets off of

259
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
 the coin.

260
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,340
 Then there's also, there's, there's, there could also be a couple of the variants at

261
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,340
 the current point toss as well, depending upon how crazy you want to get into it.

262
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
 Has it ever landed sideways?

263
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
 Nobody.

264
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,340
 Hey, no one gets the ball.

265
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
 Totally do.

266
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,340
 It's been 60 super bowls.

267
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
 It hasn't happened.

268
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
 So it's totally do.

269
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
 And with that, we are adjourned.

270
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
 I crown the two teams, coach champions.

271
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,340
 Wouldn't that be the best if they stopped the game right there?

272
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:47,340
 No, but by law at that point, both team captains have to go into a stalled burpee and start

273
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 blowing to see which way it falls to the, they actually revert to the XFL rule.

274
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,340
 But instead of players, it's both coaches have to scrum for the ball on the 50 yard

275
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
 line.

276
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
 Oh, you're all wrong.

277
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
 You're all wrong.

278
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,340
 They go back to the locker room and on their way in, they play death in the doorway.

279
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,340
 Well, gentlemen, you're all wrong.

280
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,340
 It's a thumb war between Cardi B and Sam Darnold's old case of mononuclear.

281
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,340
 Oh, we've just gotten word.

282
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,340
 Cardi B is out indefinitely.

283
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,340
 Damn that kissing game.

284
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
 We got Jacob on tails.

285
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
 I mean, that's one of their guesses.

286
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
 Boys.

287
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
 Matt, what do you got?

288
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
 I want to go through all of them.

289
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
 I want to say it's going to be called tails.

290
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,340
 It's going to be.

291
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,340
 And Seattle will like to receive.

292
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
 And then what's the other thing?

293
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
 Oh, Seattle.

294
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
 When?

295
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
 Yeah.

296
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
 Pages will lose the coin toss.

297
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
 Seattle, when the coin doesn't, Seattle electors.

298
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
 Holy shit.

299
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,340
 Can you please box that up as a parlay?

300
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
 Can you do the same?

301
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
 Do you parlay on?

302
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,340
 I don't think it's parlayable in Nevada with those options, but I'll take a look around

303
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
 and see if I can.

304
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
 That's amazing.

305
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:07,340
 If you could box up a three, a three-point parlay only on the coin toss, you could lose.

306
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
 You could lose a grand before the court.

307
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,340
 Before the whole Superbowl starts, you're like, I fucking blew my big bet.

308
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:20,340
 Let's take a 50, 50 bet and make it even more.

309
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,100
 But if, but if, but if you bet a thousand dollars and you won your coin toss parlay,

310
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,340
 you can buy the Washington Post.

311
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,100
 Bro, I think it's, I think it's pretty cheap to get right now on the market.

312
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,460
 Paul, heads or tails?

313
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
 I will go heads.

314
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
 And Justin, heads or tails?

315
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,840
 And Sacajawea coin, please, down to Sacajawea coin.

316
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,780
 It's always a, it's always a limited edition collectible coin, sir.

317
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
 Yeah.

318
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,100
 And this year they're going Sacajawea catching a ball.

319
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,220
 Oh, my sports betting app will not let me bundle even two of those things.

320
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,940
 Oh, that's so funny.

321
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,180
 Usually you can't parlay the coin toss by itself because it's got short odds, but maybe

322
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,180
 the, maybe the probable ones, but even then they're usually not parlayable.

323
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,900
 It's weird that I can't parlay it with like winner of coin toss.

324
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:26,180
 Because one side of the coin is chief interception and the other side is Sacajawea.

325
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:33,660
 They're recognizing the indigenous peoples of the, of the area and the Santa Clara Valley.

326
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,220
 I'm going to say tails never fails.

327
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:47,420
 I'm going to say that it's called tails and I'm going to say that the Patriots defer.

328
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,340
 Oh yeah, I'll say, I'll say that it's Seattle is Seattle will be calling the toss because

329
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
 they are the real team.

330
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,340
 Then Seattle will defer.

331
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,340
 Seattle will defer.

332
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,900
 Tails is called Seattle wins.

333
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,660
 And it's a, I'm not, I'll just go back to the video because I'm not going to be able

334
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,660
 to write this all down.

335
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,060
 And I will be going on team tails never fails as well, because even though it is a head

336
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:15,220
 in the longterm, I believe it is, it has been three of the last five have been heads or

337
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,300
 three, three and two in the last five years have been heads.

338
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,740
 So tails is due to wash it out.

339
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
 All right.

340
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,860
 I'll say, I'll say New England wins the coin toss and New England takes the ball.

341
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,320
 All right.

342
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,300
 And I would say that it's going to be going to say it's going to be tails.

343
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:38,660
 I think the, I've got tails, New England, New England takes the ball tails is called

344
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
 Seattle wins.

345
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,940
 Seattle, the first, that's my guess.

346
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,260
 So we'll jot all the extra ones down later, but we'll get that one.

347
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
 All right.

348
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
 I'm going to dump down to the fun stuff.

349
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,260
 Let's get some crazy things going on.

350
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,700
 Well, let's get the first one out of the way.

351
00:24:50,700 --> 00:25:00,140
 Will there be an octopus Matt's favorite prop at the super bowl, an octopus is well a player

352
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,860
 that scores the touchdown also score the following two point conversion.

353
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,300
 So like, for example, Stephon digs catches a pass for the touchdown.

354
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,900
 And then on the next play catches the pass for the two point conversion.

355
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,800
 He has to score all eight points by himself.

356
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,260
 So not the quarterback throwing the ball.

357
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
 That doesn't count.

358
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,460
 You have to be physically carrying the ball into the end zone for both the touchdown and

359
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
 the two point conversion.

360
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,460
 Yeah.

361
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,860
 It has happened.

362
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,180
 It happened like one of the first years.

363
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
 So it's always been interesting to bring that up.

364
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,100
 And I was like the first year I brought it on here happened.

365
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,020
 So I still remember getting a giant text of all caps from that.

366
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,260
 That just was octopus with 28 exclamation points after it.

367
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
 It was the best thing.

368
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,900
 It was the most interesting thing that happened to zipper ball.

369
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
 Yeah.

370
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
 And you, and Andy called it out.

371
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
 So he looked like a God in his party.

372
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,220
 It was always really good.

373
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,180
 So, all right, will there be an octopus?

374
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,940
 This one, the S will be a two pointer because it is a plus money.

375
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,780
 It is plus 15 to one right now for again, if you were at a Superbowl party, you're not

376
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,540
 a sports fan.

377
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,500
 They score a touchdown.

378
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,780
 You hear they're going to go for two, right?

379
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
 You may even know it.

380
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,060
 You might even not know all the focus to be here.

381
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
 Go for two.

382
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
 Yell octopus.

383
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
 That's it.

384
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,820
 Just go octopus and you'll be the hit of the party.

385
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,540
 It'll be the hit of the party because someone could potentially score eight points.

386
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
 Yeah.

387
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
 Yeah.

388
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,060
 And then when somebody else asks what's an octopus, pull this episode up and go to the

389
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,700
 bathroom and watch back to this moment so you can have it explained to you because you've

390
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,400
 definitely forgotten.

391
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,380
 Or just ping me on discord and I'll see if I can set it here real quick as much as I

392
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
 love it.

393
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
 This Justin's going.

394
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
 Yes.

395
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
 Yeah.

396
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,860
 You want to know what I'll say, um, well actually no, cause new England's run defense is really

397
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
 good.

398
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,500
 So normally it would either be running quarterbacks or running backs.

399
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,860
 And if you have a really, really good running game, I don't think new England trusts the

400
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
 running game.

401
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,740
 I think that the C is Seattle does, but new England's run defense is really good.

402
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,620
 So if you're going to go for two, you would probably want to try to get at least JSN involved.

403
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,340
 Although you want to know what I'm going to say?

404
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
 Yes.

405
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
 And here's what it is.

406
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:14,020
 It's going to be, uh, it's, uh, uh, you're calling the specific octopus Jackson Smith

407
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,580
 and Jigba on the score.

408
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,620
 And then he has like run, no running plays.

409
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,300
 He's running like five running plays all year.

410
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,220
 That's when you do the jet sweep, that's going to be the end around JSN and he, and he makes

411
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,540
 he outruns whoever he needs to outrun the corner.

412
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,540
 I like it.

413
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,140
 I like, I'm, I'm going with yes as well.

414
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:42,700
 And I like JSN for the, uh, for the octopus as well, uh, Matt, oh, uh, no, I'm not greedy.

415
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,060
 I've had one octopus in my lifetime in the super bowl.

416
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:51,380
 That's in moderation, everything in my, I'll be telling my grandkids about, I choose to

417
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,420
 live in a world where fun things happen.

418
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
 Yeah.

419
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,700
 Uh, Paul, do you, will you be partaking in the calamari or do you think it will be not,

420
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
 not happening?

421
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
 I think it's going to happen.

422
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
 Whoa.

423
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
 All right.

424
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,420
 And I will be on the not happening as well side because good God, we lose too much money.

425
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,860
 If that does happen, can I tell you guys?

426
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
 All right.

427
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
 This is inside sauce.

428
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
 Okay.

429
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,860
 Um, but, uh, there's a new episode of world's greatest con coming out in the next 48 hours.

430
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:29,380
 And, uh, somebody sends, uh, somebody involved Brian send somebody preview episodes because

431
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,460
 they really like it.

432
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
 It's a member of Penn and Teller.

433
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,300
 I'm not going to tell you which one, but he doesn't have a podcast with Matt and may or

434
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,820
 may not be Brian's adopted father.

435
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
 Yeah.

436
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,660
 I'm not going to tell you which, which member of Penn and Teller, but, uh, in the new episode,

437
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,160
 the phrase proposition bet is explained.

438
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,020
 And this member of Penn and Teller mystery said that he has never been clear on what

439
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,660
 a proposition bet was until he listened to this episode.

440
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,100
 Oh, okay.

441
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,340
 I guess.

442
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
 Yeah.

443
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:08,220
 I mean, if you're not a sports person, you wouldn't really know that you wouldn't really

444
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
 know it.

445
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,220
 Even though they've lived in Vegas for 30 years.

446
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:20,900
 There's probably been actively involved, something with them as a bet at one point in time.

447
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,980
 It is amazing to me when Vegas people ask me like, wait, what does the plus and minus

448
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,780
 mean on the, on the sports betting, but you, you live here, you should have picked that

449
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
 up at least.

450
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,540
 Although I think when it comes to football, the last time I know two times ago at scoop

451
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,220
 fest, when we were on Penn Sunday school and Penn was complaining about how he doesn't

452
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,100
 know what the NFL draft is and I reminded him that he was explaining the NFL draft on

453
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
 television.

454
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,140
 You're literally on it explaining it right there.

455
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
 All right.

456
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,140
 We'll go.

457
00:29:53,140 --> 00:30:00,160
 We're going to take this one is this one is for Paul, put on your tin foil hats, ladies

458
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,380
 and gentlemen, bring it.

459
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,420
 Until they mentioned the electrical substation by the stadium during the broadcast.

460
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:14,380
 Oh, I'm not sure you're familiar with this, but he's much more loquacious than I am.

461
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,400
 What is the significance of the electrical substation?

462
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
 Yes.

463
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
 Yes.

464
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
 We get to explain the substation.

465
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 Justin time.

466
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,380
 Oh, I'll refer to you, sir.

467
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:30,180
 So the 49ers practice at a facility in Santa Clara.

468
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
 Yeah.

469
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,540
 So that practice facility is an electrical substation.

470
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:40,300
 The 49ers have been especially injury plagued over the last few years, but never more so

471
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,820
 than they were this year when it seemed like every other week, one of their star players

472
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,700
 was going out with season ending injuries, ACL tears.

473
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:57,860
 And so there became a rumor that maybe the electromagnetic field from that substation

474
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:08,180
 that was weakening the ACLs of the 49ers players, this led to both of the teams not practicing

475
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:15,780
 for super bowl week at that 49ers facility instead opting to go to other colleges in

476
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,060
 the, in the area to practice all week and also being two and a half mile hours of a

477
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,260
 drive away from both hotels that are being hosted.

478
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,020
 It doesn't help either.

479
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
 Talk about the journal.

480
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:35,740
 Oh, there was a journalist that went in there and was measuring to take readings of, of

481
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,580
 the electromagnetic fields.

482
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,960
 So there's been, there's been a lot of conversation about it.

483
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,060
 It's probably bullshit, but I care to ignore that and believe that this is an actual issue

484
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:55,540
 that just being torn from the bone by electromagnetic pulses is this field.

485
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,820
 What is this field, John Lynch, the 49ers general manager said that it was conjecture

486
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,020
 worth looking into.

487
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
 Oh boy.

488
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,220
 That was the thing is that when the Niners said, we'll take a look at it, I was like,

489
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,300
 that's not the answer you want to give, but okay.

490
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,300
 No, right.

491
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,100
 What is, so yeah, there's been a whole bunch of hype around this.

492
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
 It's Levi's, Levi's stadium.

493
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
 All right.

494
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
 I got you.

495
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
 So it's, it's an electrical substation.

496
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
 No, no, no.

497
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
 It emits.

498
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
 Oh, no, I got that.

499
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,060
 I'm telling you, not that I'm asking about the stadium.

500
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,180
 What kind of, it's Levi's stadium open air.

501
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:31,860
 What kind of events are played there in San Francisco, like it's just like full on regular

502
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
 season games.

503
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,820
 It's mainly big concerts using the Niners play there.

504
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,300
 It's not, the substation is not getting mentioned substation is not getting mentioned in the

505
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
 broadcast.

506
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
 Wow.

507
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,660
 Conspiracy theory taking the no or Paul, you taking the no here because I don't think the

508
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
 yes.

509
00:32:48,660 --> 00:33:00,940
 Man, no, if, because if they, if even ingest the NFL, if the NFL broadcasters mention the

510
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:09,460
 fact that there is speculation even that electromagnetic fields are affecting players and therefore

511
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,860
 they practiced offsite.

512
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,100
 What do you think that does to the general populace who goes to see games in that stadium?

513
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:22,140
 The lawsuit fetishes of this country will be all the fuck over it.

514
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,900
 Paul, I think you're undercutting this.

515
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,820
 I think you are not going big enough.

516
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,960
 It is not what will people who go see games in the stadium say.

517
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,820
 It's what will people who live near electrical substations across the country say?

518
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
 You're right.

519
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,820
 Well that too.

520
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,060
 Well, but dude, I mean, no, cause this is just electrical substation.

521
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,500
 Look, this is not like a big special thing.

522
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,640
 I'm a Kentucky boy.

523
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,980
 This ain't new to me.

524
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,420
 This was, this was one of the things that dairy farmers always talk shit about.

525
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,660
 They're like, I can't get my cows to milk, right?

526
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,920
 Because of all these goddamn electrical lines.

527
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,520
 So this is the thing.

528
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,020
 This has been a fall.

529
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,100
 You are wrong for the right reasons.

530
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
 Great.

531
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
 This is my life.

532
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
 Here's why.

533
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
 So go ahead.

534
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
 Tell me you are.

535
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:15,660
 You are correct in that the NFL is a punitive old boys network that would crack down on

536
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:21,100
 anything that could be a bad for any one of the owners.

537
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
 Here's where you're missing it.

538
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
 Okay.

539
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:31,140
 It is an old boys network that is essentially just a very exclusive golf club for 32 very

540
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,300
 rich men who hate each other.

541
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:40,320
 So there's never really any one thing that's sacred except for we should not offer players

542
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,380
 guaranteed contracts.

543
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,380
 That's the one thing.

544
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,380
 Okay.

545
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,020
 That's the one thing they all agree on every day.

546
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,900
 Like, so if somebody says, yeah, the substation is just tearing ACLs off the bone in San Francisco.

547
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
 Wow.

548
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,300
 Then Jerry Jones, who has his own cadre is going to be like, ah, what a great line.

549
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,300
 Oh, that's amazing.

550
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,900
 He's going to be texting whoever the announcer is.

551
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
 Great job.

552
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
 Keep doing it.

553
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
 Okay.

554
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
 That's possible.

555
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,900
 All right.

556
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
 So yeah.

557
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
 So Justin's going to the yes side on that one.

558
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,020
 No, I also think they're going to say no, but I don't think they're not going to say

559
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
 anything about it.

560
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
 Yeah.

561
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,780
 I don't think that that's going to be where they, they, well, who, hold on, who are the

562
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
 announcers?

563
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,180
 It's a Collins worth crew.

564
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
 So it's ended CNBC.

565
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,660
 Oh my, you know, that's substation has just been a killer for all these players.

566
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
 Yeah.

567
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,180
 A hand to the Niners making it through the season with Collins worth and Melissa Stark

568
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
 will be the main three.

569
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
 No.

570
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,820
 See, they're not like, wink, wink guys, they're not saying it, they're not saying it.

571
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,500
 If it were Tom Brady and KB, I would vote yes.

572
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,860
 But it's Collins worth and Stark.

573
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,860
 I'm going to say no.

574
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
 All right.

575
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,740
 So I am the only person who would do it is Al Michaels.

576
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,420
 If Al Michaels was doing it, then he'd be like, according to the substation, they're

577
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,900
 not doing their thing.

578
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
 They're all dying.

579
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,180
 You don't think Terry McCauley, you don't think rules analyst, Terry McCauley is going

580
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
 to mention it.

581
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
 Oh my God.

582
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
 Yeah.

583
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,180
 Maybe gene's territory.

584
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
 All right.

585
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,780
 So while we're on the announcing team, we'll go with the next one.

586
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,260
 I am the only yes on that one, by the way, will Chris Collins worth somehow find a way

587
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,060
 to mention Patrick Mahomes?

588
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
 Yes.

589
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
 Okay.

590
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,380
 Can you really bet on this?

591
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
 Sure.

592
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,940
 There are all, there are offshores that out for it.

593
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,940
 So yes.

594
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
 Oh God.

595
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,940
 Bet my mortgage.

596
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,340
 I would also like to bet just as mortgage, anyone who throws on the fucking run, it's

597
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:42,220
 like, Oh my, you know, Drake, man, I haven't seen a quarterback.

598
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,220
 Patrick Mahomes.

599
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,620
 I mean, my God, he's going to bring up the fact that the last five Superbowls have had

600
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,980
 a minute until this one.

601
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
 Yeah.

602
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
 Yeah.

603
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
 Yeah.

604
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
 This is the last one.

605
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,480
 And I was just dreaming about Patrick Mahomes last night and I was just thinking about his

606
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,260
 sweet baby face and his round derriere and Mike, I was just in hog heaven.

607
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,420
 I was thinking about it.

608
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,780
 My wife is fully turgid.

609
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,140
 My wife has never loved me.

610
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,180
 Like Collins worth loves Patrick Mahomes.

611
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,140
 I don't think anybody has loved anybody in humanity.

612
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,460
 Like Patrick Collins worth loves Patrick Mahomes.

613
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
 Yeah.

614
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,940
 Paul, are you joining us on team?

615
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
 Yes.

616
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
 Are you going to be our contrarian here?

617
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,060
 I say, I say, no, it's not going to, it's not going to happen.

618
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
 No.

619
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
 All right.

620
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,380
 Paul will be our contrarian.

621
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,380
 Will bad.

622
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
 We'll go to the halftime show here for a little bit.

623
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,460
 Will bad bunny mention ice during his performance?

624
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,180
 Will bad bunny mention ice?

625
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,660
 A yes is the betting favorite at minus one 50 right now.

626
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,260
 It actually might be up to 200 cents.

627
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
 The Grammys.

628
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
 I haven't checked.

629
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
 Let me, let me ask you a question.

630
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
 Clarifying question.

631
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,700
 Does he have to mention ice by name?

632
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,780
 Does he have to say the word ice?

633
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
 Will he mention it in Spanish?

634
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
 Yes.

635
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
 He has to say ice.

636
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:00,820
 Oh, but if he says it in Spanish, El Frigio Agua, everyone knows.

637
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:10,540
 Yes, El Frigio Agua.

638
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,980
 So we've got, I think he will do something because he did it on the last thing he did

639
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
 at the Grammys.

640
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,540
 So I can't see him not saying something at some point.

641
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
 All right.

642
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,780
 So we got Jacob on the no, no, I guess me, Oh, Jacob's on the yes.

643
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
 I guess everybody's out.

644
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
 Is everybody on the yes?

645
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,780
 No, I'm going no.

646
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,900
 Cause I think they're going to do like some symbol that's supposed to be interpreted as

647
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,420
 anti ice, but they're not going to say specific.

648
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,900
 So you guys are going to come across zero percent chance, zero percent chance that this

649
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
 happens.

650
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,500
 Look, there's a lot of talk about that 32 old boys network, right?

651
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,420
 Here's one thing that they all agree on.

652
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,140
 They don't want Kaepernick.

653
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:56,460
 They don't want anything like when Kendrick Lamar came out, Kendrick Lamar had to do things

654
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,420
 that were kind of, it was like Sam Jackson yelling in an uncle Sam outfit is like, okay,

655
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,020
 that's vaguely, you know, it seems like a Spike Lee movie.

656
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
 Those are racial.

657
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,180
 Like it wasn't anything direct.

658
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,540
 Like I don't think that there's anything close to a specific mentioned eyes.

659
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:20,740
 I think there might not be a moment where he rips out his shirt and his titty says,

660
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740
 fuck ice on it.

661
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:31,820
 So there could be background signs and stuff, but I'm saying he has some civically say fuck

662
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,340
 ice or get ice out.

663
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,200
 You might get a fuck ice titty.

664
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,100
 Is there now in the, in the parallel kid rock conscious happening in the like whitey McWhitey

665
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,980
 network, whatever it's called the TP USA, the real halftime show in my house.

666
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
 Oh no.

667
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,260
 Will he mention ice?

668
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,580
 You know, will he, will he, will he hand medals to ice?

669
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,420
 Those agents that killed people in Minnesota.

670
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,100
 He's gonna, he's gonna kiss one live on stage, him and the two guys that shot pretty are

671
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
 going to triple kiss.

672
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
 He's going to baptize.

673
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
 I'm really surprised.

674
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
 I'm not surprised.

675
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
 They haven't had a damn.

676
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,500
 I just totally lost my train of thought.

677
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
 Nevermind.

678
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
 Sorry about that.

679
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,820
 Justin, could you name any of the other three headliners that are going to be part of that

680
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,340
 halftime show with kid rock?

681
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:23,620
 No, the other random creative players, the music creative players, the other country.

682
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,180
 One of them's like an American idol person.

683
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:37,400
 I think Rhett Rhett chamber, chamberless, um, Gary Busey, Dirty McBurks fan, Doug McFiddleston

684
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,020
 and uh, uh, uh, Bill guitar, guitar.

685
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
 You said you didn't know any of them.

686
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,220
 Dude, I saw Bill guitar open a Cachella.

687
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
 He was actually really good.

688
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
 Yeah, no.

689
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
 Yeah.

690
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,620
 I am in the entertainment industry and I have no idea who these other three people are.

691
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,700
 Where is the, where is the tapu so halftime show happening?

692
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
 I don't even know how to tune in.

693
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,620
 Uh, I would assume somewhere in the South, other than that, I'm not sure.

694
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,900
 I just assumed it was happening at the Arizona Cardinal stadium.

695
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,340
 I think it's on like Newsmax and a couple other channels being simulcasted on a bunch

696
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,100
 of different, um, cable networks and like online streaming services.

697
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,940
 Weamer screamer creamer with the brutal one in the chat over, under our odds that Christie

698
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,220
 Noam appears at the puppy bowl only at the end, only at the end.

699
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,700
 I'll tell you that just to lose the new wrinkle this year, the winning team gets adopted.

700
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,740
 The losing team gets to hang out with Christie Noam.

701
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,580
 Oh, she's going to bring you out to the gravel pit.

702
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:46,860
 Like we take what headwear will bad bunny be wearing at the start of the halftime show?

703
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:52,460
 Your options are a straw hat, a baseball cap, no headwear, a beanie or any other.

704
00:41:52,460 --> 00:42:03,780
 Oh, I had where I'll take any other, yeah.

705
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,140
 Isn't he known for wearing a salad shooter in his concerts?

706
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,140
 Isn't that part of his stick?

707
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:19,220
 He comes out and he's like, you know, sometimes people tell me I'm a bad bunny and I just

708
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,460
 tell him, honey, it's like a carrot filled salad.

709
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,860
 And then he starts turning his hat and he crunches a carrot through it and he's like,

710
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,020
 Paul, Paul, I shoot some salad challenge.

711
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
 I think you're thinking Gallagher.

712
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
 Right.

713
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
 Yeah.

714
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,020
 No, no, no.

715
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,020
 It's Gallagher.

716
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,020
 I was thinking Gallagher.

717
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,020
 Yeah.

718
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,020
 Gallagher.

719
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,020
 That's Gallagher and bad bunny.

720
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,020
 I think it was Gallagher too.

721
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
 Not Gallagher.

722
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,020
 You're right.

723
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,020
 It was Gallagher too.

724
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
 Cause he's from Puerto Rico.

725
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,020
 I'm going to go.

726
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020
 No head.

727
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,020
 No headwear.

728
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,020
 All right.

729
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:56,420
 Justin and Matt on none me on province straw hat and Jacob and Paul on any other.

730
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,460
 Cause Paul's strictly moonshotting a salad.

731
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,740
 Hey, can I ask you guys a real, a real question?

732
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,740
 Oh, now here we go.

733
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,740
 They're going to do subtitles.

734
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
 Yes.

735
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,740
 I hope they do.

736
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,740
 I hope they do the because they did that.

737
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,860
 I saw the video where they did that for one of his recent songs and it was great.

738
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,860
 So yeah, I think, I think they will cause he doesn't sing in England.

739
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:26,380
 I don't think people really understand that like there's no English words in any of his

740
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,900
 music at all, but he sings, he does not.

741
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,860
 If there is a word that is in English, it's by fucking accident.

742
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,620
 Cause it's the same word in Spanish.

743
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,780
 Do you think that they might not have the Spanish word is no.

744
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:44,640
 Do you think that they might put subtitles on inside of the arena itself?

745
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,940
 I would think you, you gotta do it for the audience at home.

746
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,580
 Cause that's the, I think they're going to have a team of really aggressive people with

747
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,020
 a scroll and one person writing really fast with a marker and they're just going to run

748
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,380
 it really fast across the, across the stage.

749
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,620
 Oh, I mean, they do have the ribbon, the ribbon boards in stadiums that show the closed captioning

750
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
 already.

751
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:07,260
 So they probably will have it for his thing as well.

752
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,260
 Or also ASL.

753
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,260
 There's probably that.

754
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,260
 Ooh.

755
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,260
 Would that be ASL or that is there Spanish?

756
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,260
 How do you sign Spanish in American sign?

757
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,260
 That mean ESL for Espanol.

758
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,260
 I thought you meant English, second language.

759
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,260
 No.

760
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
 All right.

761
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:24,860
 Well, let's get to some, let's do some ads here while we're at it.

762
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,660
 Which animal will be shown first in the super bowl ad starting after the kickoff.

763
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,580
 So this doesn't count anything before the pregame show.

764
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,980
 After the game is kicked, we go to commercials, will a cat be shown first or a dog be shown

765
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,980
 first?

766
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,980
 Ooh.

767
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,980
 Straight up normal man.

768
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
 Dog.

769
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,980
 I am on dog.

770
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,980
 Yeah.

771
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,980
 Dog.

772
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,980
 Dog.

773
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,980
 Dog.

774
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,980
 Dog.

775
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,980
 Dog.

776
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,980
 Dog.

777
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,980
 Nasty dog.

778
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,980
 Dirty dog.

779
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,920
 Unless the cat is, is torturing the dog or tormenting the dog.

780
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:03,220
 So that, that, that, that just wanted, I can't go horse cause I would go horse.

781
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,780
 No, no horses allowed.

782
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,620
 This isn't, this isn't Taylor.

783
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,060
 Sheridan is going to be furious.

784
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,060
 No horses.

785
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
 I know Taylor.

786
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
 So pissed.

787
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
 He's like, what the fuck?

788
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060
 I'm going to Netflix.

789
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,060
 Matt, you go on Contrarian on this one.

790
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,060
 Of course I am fucking team cats surrounded by two sleeping ones right now.

791
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
 All right.

792
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:29,860
 Continuing on the ad form, which ad is shown first, the liquid death ad or the, he gets

793
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,860
 us ad.

794
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
 What's he get?

795
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
 Both have been.

796
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,860
 He gets us.

797
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,860
 He gets us.

798
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,140
 Is the church Jesus, the churchy one that is going to be very early.

799
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,740
 It's going to be the churchy one is the, they're, they're like the youth pastor.

800
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,740
 Yeah.

801
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,780
 Like the, it's the commercial that sits down on a chair backwards.

802
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,780
 Yeah.

803
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,780
 Turns attack guys.

804
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:54,020
 You want to know who else you want to know who else kicked off and wound up finding glory?

805
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,500
 Our Lord Jesus Christ.

806
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,500
 Yeah.

807
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,020
 You know, I was led 11 men to the victory.

808
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:08,380
 Now when you're talking about the liquid death, what's been the resolution on the fact that

809
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,380
 it's been proven that they're not giving any of their funds to charity.

810
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,880
 Like they claim Paul, you want to know which business magnets not being held accountable

811
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,740
 for the horrific crimes against humanity they're committing on a regular basis.

812
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,740
 Yeah.

813
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,740
 And that's the climate where, where our government is cracking down on, on fraud.

814
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,380
 I'd like to know how,

815
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:34,420
 they're getting to it now from the public.

816
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,420
 That's fine.

817
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,420
 They're not taking government.

818
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,420
 I guess you're right.

819
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,420
 Good.

820
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,420
 Yeah.

821
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,420
 I guess you're right.

822
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
 What?

823
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,420
 Look, they're fucking charging $4 for a can of water.

824
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,420
 They won.

825
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,420
 Yeah.

826
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,420
 It doesn't matter.

827
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:51,260
 They can operate above the law happened on Epstein Epstein's Island in 4k and nobody

828
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,260
 gives a shit.

829
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,980
 They've hoodwinked the public already.

830
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,820
 So I'm going to take liquid death history, the contrarian apparently on that one.

831
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,820
 Then

832
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,540
 I'll take a diamond J.

833
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,020
 Will Cardi B be wearing a Stefan Diggs?

834
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,020
 I went liquid death.

835
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,020
 Oh, by the way.

836
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,180
 Oh, Matt, when we left, okay, Matt and I are both looking at death.

837
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,780
 Some of us need liquid death to stay in business in order to keep doing their most requested

838
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,780
 magic trick.

839
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,920
 So I guess we need them to keep doing well.

840
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
 Good call.

841
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,780
 Will Cardi B be, will Cardi B be wearing a Stefan Diggs or will she be wearing something

842
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,780
 else?

843
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,780
 Nothing else.

844
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,820
 She is connected to Jersey.

845
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
 Doesn't show the girls off.

846
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,820
 You know what I mean?

847
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,820
 Not at all.

848
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,820
 We need Cardi.

849
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,820
 We're in a hole that way.

850
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,820
 We are.

851
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,820
 Are we counting a custom?

852
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,340
 Like, if it's a, if it's a, if it's a Christian Juzic, as long as the Jersey is the base

853
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,340
 of it, it still counts.

854
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,340
 Yes.

855
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,340
 I think yes.

856
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,340
 I would say yes.

857
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,340
 Yeah.

858
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,340
 She has been in the past wearing those.

859
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,380
 I'm on the yes as well because I think she'll get that Niners tight end dude, Juzic or whatever

860
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,380
 his name is, wife to make her something.

861
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,100
 Cause she did all the puffer jackets for Taylor and all this stuff for Brittany Holmes.

862
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,380
 I think she'll do something for them as well.

863
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,380
 For Cardi.

864
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,420
 I think she's going to be in the craft box too.

865
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,420
 So they're going to, they're going to see her a lot.

866
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,420
 And also there's the rumor that she is going to be part of the halftime show because she

867
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,580
 has that song with Bad Bunny.

868
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,220
 And she also, unlike Bad Bunny, raps in English.

869
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,220
 Oh yeah.

870
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,220
 Oh, well she's out.

871
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,220
 Yeah.

872
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,220
 Sorry.

873
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:29,100
 So Paul, you got a stance on that one.

874
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,100
 Yeah.

875
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,100
 I agree.

876
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,100
 I think yes.

877
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
 However, also like Bad Bunny.

878
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,780
 I also need subtitles to know what she's talking about.

879
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,780
 Never experienced that.

880
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,020
 Take a look at this.

881
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,420
 Will the final score of the game be a Scoragami?

882
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,700
 For those of you that don't know at home, a Scoragami is a unique score that has never

883
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,660
 happened in NFL history.

884
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,180
 There is a website that tracks all this.

885
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,340
 It's been around for quite a while.

886
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,220
 It's a pretty fun factor.

887
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,820
 So will the team, will the final score of the game be a unique score that hasn't happened

888
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,180
 in NFL history?

889
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,660
 Those aren't that hard to come by.

890
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
 Are they Mitzi?

891
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,660
 Yes.

892
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,660
 It's about, yes.

893
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,380
 It's 25 to one that this will be a Scoragami.

894
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,380
 It's not very likely to happen.

895
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,380
 Okay.

896
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
 So it is more, okay.

897
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,220
 So most scores have happened at this point.

898
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:24,180
 The chance for a Scoragami is higher in that weird shit does happen more often than you

899
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,620
 would think in the Superbowl.

900
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,660
 Like there's a, there's a fair, there's a lot of safety.

901
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:35,080
 There's more safeties than you would think of in the Superbowl for random reasons.

902
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,380
 But I will say no, I'll take chalk on that.

903
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:45,940
 I'll say, Paul's on the yes on that one is going to be a weird score.

904
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
 Final score.

905
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
 Be a Scoragami.

906
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,060
 Oh, I wanted it in my heart.

907
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,060
 Let's say yes.

908
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,060
 Yeah.

909
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,060
 I wanted in my heart.

910
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,500
 I already took the octopus.

911
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,500
 I'm not taking Scoragami too.

912
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,220
 You want to parlay them, Jacob?

913
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,220
 I will parlay.

914
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,020
 I would love to parlay them.

915
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,740
 All right.

916
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:09,820
 Will a scoring drive take less time than the singing of the national Anthem?

917
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,600
 So will a draft scoring drive in the game take less than the right now at two minutes

918
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,140
 that it's set to be the Anthem.

919
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,140
 Yes.

920
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,260
 The yes is the heavy favorite.

921
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,580
 I will be taking a yes as well because it could be one play or yeah, and it's got to

922
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,140
 be a, it's got to be a scoring drive any time in the game.

923
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,300
 So not a kickoff return doesn't count.

924
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,300
 Okay.

925
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,100
 So I have an established play and then go from there.

926
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,780
 So it could be a first play touchdown.

927
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,060
 It could be a couple of plays.

928
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:43,020
 I'm taking the yes because there's usually, right, especially now with the modified kickoff,

929
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,780
 the opening kicks aren't getting, they're getting closer.

930
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,500
 So it only takes one or two plays for them to get that last second field goal.

931
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,380
 But wait, hold on, hold on.

932
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,140
 Are we talking about game time or real time?

933
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,940
 Clock time, not actual time.

934
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,460
 So two minutes of clock time, not two minutes of actual time.

935
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,460
 I'm going to say no.

936
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,220
 Do you think it's going to be a lot of long drawn out slogs?

937
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:11,500
 I just think that both teams are going to need to rely on running the ball or they're

938
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,860
 going to be relying on short passes inside.

939
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,460
 And so just, you're going to see a lot of clock even for drives that are moving fast.

940
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,060
 I was going to say, this is, this is me saying yes, because I also took the over.

941
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,940
 I think there's going to be some scoring drives.

942
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,940
 Yeah.

943
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,660
 Paul, you got a stance on this one?

944
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,580
 I said, I think, I think, I think there will be one that goes quicker.

945
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,580
 All right.

946
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,580
 And Matt?

947
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,660
 I just, just no, cause I want to go against Jacob and Paul.

948
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,220
 You're racking them points up.

949
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,220
 All right.

950
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:48,940
 First play of the game will be a run or a pass.

951
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,700
 I will, I will be taking a run because it is currently the favorite.

952
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,740
 Justin was on the favorite as well.

953
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,740
 Yeah.

954
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,740
 I'll take that run.

955
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,700
 Oh, in the sky, it's captain contrarian.

956
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,700
 It's going to be a pass.

957
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,780
 I'll take pass Matt and Paul on the pass.

958
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,180
 All right.

959
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,900
 A Jersey number of the first player to score a touchdown.

960
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,820
 The overrun is the overrunner set at 10 and a half players with the number under 10 that

961
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:28,100
 you need to worry about our Stefan digs, Drake may a Walker and I believe he is Sam, right?

962
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,600
 I got to find his one second here.

963
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
 Yeah.

964
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
 Where are you?

965
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:39,460
 JSN under over for me, Jen or Jason's 11.

966
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,460
 So he's over.

967
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,460
 Oh, that over.

968
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
 So over.

969
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,300
 I'll stay on Jacob.

970
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,460
 So Jacob and I are on the under.

971
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:55,360
 Everybody else is on the over X P N captain contrarian.

972
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
 Captain contrarian.

973
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
 All right.

974
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,520
 Let's get the another fun one.

975
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,020
 Will an offensive lineman score a touchdown?

976
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,580
 Will a player that is listed as an offensive lineman score a touchdown with tackle eligible

977
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,940
 has happened a bit with these teams, but I don't think anybody has scored a touchdown.

978
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,980
 Yes is the massive underdog in this one.

979
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,340
 Here's the reason why you roll the dice.

980
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:24,860
 One of the people that famously did this was Bill Belichick with his offensive lineman,

981
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,940
 Mike Frabel, who is now the head coach of the new England Patriots.

982
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,580
 Is he going to pass down the lineage and have a big man touchdown?

983
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,500
 That's the argument and I'm going to, I'm going to buy the hype.

984
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,760
 I'm going to say, yeah, I live in a world where things like this can happen.

985
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,180
 So I'm saying yes.

986
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,020
 If it's in the playbook, it would be brought out on Sunday.

987
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,020
 There ain't no more games.

988
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,740
 You can't exchange unused trick plays for sizzler gift certificates.

989
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,180
 It's baby.

990
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,980
 Yes, Matt and you lean on this one.

991
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,980
 Yes.

992
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,380
 Only cause I liked the term gadget and Paulie.

993
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,380
 Yes.

994
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,380
 Paul.

995
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,380
 Nope.

996
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:15,380
 I will, I will be the contrarian on that one that all right, will a field goal or PAT hit

997
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,180
 the upright or crossbar?

998
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,260
 Will there be a kick that clanks?

999
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,460
 What's the normal thing on that?

1000
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,580
 How many, how often does that happen?

1001
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,620
 Is there, it's happening a little bit more now that they moved the PAT back, but also

1002
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,340
 now they're just missing more.

1003
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:36,500
 So it hasn't been as much, but when it opened, it was like doing this prop first started

1004
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,500
 being dealt.

1005
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,620
 So eight or 10 to one, now it's about five to one on the yes.

1006
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,420
 So it is drifting down and just happening a little more regular.

1007
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,300
 But here's, here's the other thing, Paul, is that the field goal kicks have gotten ridiculous

1008
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,140
 lately where it used to be like a shocking thing that would break in live if somebody

1009
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,660
 was kicking from past 30 yards and now people kick from 70 yards and nobody blink blinks

1010
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,660
 an eye.

1011
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,260
 And the only reason why people were missing is because that same strategy was being applied

1012
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,040
 when the weather got shitty and outdoor stadiums.

1013
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
 It's going to be in the Bay.

1014
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,660
 It's going to be the exact same fucking weather that it always is in the Bay.

1015
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,060
 It's going to be gorgeous.

1016
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,900
 No one's going to give a fuck about a shooting their shot from as far out as they want.

1017
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
 And I don't think that the wind is going to be a factor.

1018
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,900
 Okay.

1019
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,700
 That being said, I'm taking it just so it goes from a shot of Cardi B to a shot of a,

1020
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,700
 a hitting it off the post.

1021
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,700
 It's the donk doink.

1022
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,700
 I like it.

1023
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,700
 I like it.

1024
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,700
 Don't get doink.

1025
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,700
 But don't get doink.

1026
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:35,620
 I don't think I can get donk donk clearance cleared through gaming, donk donk partly cleared

1027
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,620
 through gaming.

1028
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
 But that would be a fun one to often.

1029
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,620
 That would be.

1030
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,620
 Yeah.

1031
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,620
 Yeah.

1032
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
 I'll take it.

1033
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,620
 I say, what the hell?

1034
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,620
 It's not that rare.

1035
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,460
 I just need to remember it happening a lot in, in Super Bowls.

1036
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:55,700
 So Jacob and I are saying no, no, I'm going to, I'm going to take the yes just because

1037
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,420
 if it happens, we get our asses kicked and it usually ends up happening.

1038
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,420
 All right.

1039
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,740
 Will the game go to overtime?

1040
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,620
 Usually the no is a lock.

1041
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,820
 Last year didn't happen.

1042
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,460
 Last year it actually went to overtime.

1043
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,900
 So what do you think?

1044
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,620
 Nah, no way.

1045
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,700
 Nah, no, no, I don't think so.

1046
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,700
 No.

1047
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,300
 All right.

1048
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,300
 That is the first one.

1049
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:28,100
 We are full team one side.

1050
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:35,740
 When will the first player go into the medical tent before or after halftime?

1051
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,140
 So this is either concussion protocol or an on-field injury getting checked also has to

1052
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,820
 be shown on the broadcast.

1053
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,780
 So that's the other thing is either so shown or have the side and correspondents say, blah,

1054
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,340
 blah, blah was in the tent.

1055
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,380
 So it's got to be shown or mentioned.

1056
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:58,140
 If an ACL rips clean, like a slow cooked baby back rib because of EMF rays, do they go to

1057
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,420
 the tent or they just go right to the, no, that's carted off.

1058
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,420
 That's different.

1059
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:10,860
 It's got to go into the blue tent protocol, ankles, knees, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff like

1060
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,860
 that.

1061
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,940
 Justin, here's my feeling on it.

1062
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:20,180
 It's going to be second half because adrenaline so high in the first, even if that does happen,

1063
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,380
 they're still walking it off from a little dirt in it.

1064
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:29,140
 Well, but the problem is now they've got the independent people that are watching the game.

1065
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:35,500
 So if you, if you get hit in the head, the air on the side of a fencing position, because

1066
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,700
 that's the universal sign that your brain turned off against its will, normally you

1067
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,020
 would just be allowed to play another down a football and then they would shoot you up

1068
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,340
 with Torah doll on the sidelines.

1069
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:53,060
 Now they have somebody like a pussy who makes you go to the back and, you know, concerned

1070
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,060
 about your health.

1071
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,060
 Yeah, no, that's good.

1072
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,100
 I, I, I'm going to go with the second half still.

1073
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:04,580
 I'll say first half because also this, this is the time where they're going to be extra

1074
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:09,180
 fucking concerned about shit like that because they, they do want to make it seem like they

1075
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,180
 give a fuck.

1076
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:14,300
 So I'll bet on first, they want to make it look like they care about concussions.

1077
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,380
 I think it's going to happen before, even though Paul's hecking have, we know it's also

1078
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,900
 a good lead because the start of the second half, there's a slightly more prone to injury

1079
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,160
 because it's a longer half time than normal.

1080
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:32,620
 So they're a little more rested as they cool, they get iced, tighten up, bad buddy has his

1081
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,620
 way.

1082
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:37,540
 Hey, second half, please.

1083
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:46,580
 No medical, Tim, that would be second half or never been, baby.

1084
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:53,500
 I'm saying never know the MVP bank first in their victory speech.

1085
00:58:53,500 --> 00:59:04,060
 Your options are God teammate, family, city or fans and the super long shot at 6,660 420

1086
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:10,860
 to one Staten and or Snoop Dogg teammates teammates.

1087
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,220
 So my pick of golden palace.com off the board.

1088
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,220
 Yeah.

1089
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,220
 Yes.

1090
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:22,880
 So Paul, Paul's going teammates.

1091
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,420
 I'm going to God.

1092
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,420
 God.

1093
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,420
 Yeah.

1094
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,420
 Big man.

1095
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,420
 Yeah.

1096
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,980
 First of all, give all the glory to God.

1097
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,660
 Number two, I just love my teammates, man.

1098
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:39,780
 And my family, I'm going to go previously unacknowledged child previously unacknowledged

1099
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,780
 child.

1100
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,660
 Oh, she has a secret family.

1101
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,700
 He's going to thank his secret family.

1102
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:49,500
 Stefan Diggs says the right over the longest time ever, because yes, I think all 97 of

1103
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,500
 his children.

1104
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,380
 I know Stefan between Stefan Diggs, Elon Musk and future.

1105
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:59,140
 I think that they might be able to populate a small town with, and that's just the kids

1106
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,900
 that they don't know their first names right now.

1107
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,260
 That's the entire, that's the entire, that's one section of the stadium.

1108
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,280
 It's just that it's just their kids right now.

1109
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,660
 That's just, that's just sons from the three of them that they only referred to as big

1110
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:16,380
 man because they can't remember what the first name is chief right now, Robert Sala and Philip

1111
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,660
 rivers are like, damn, yeah.

1112
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,660
 It's like, fuck man.

1113
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,180
 We were just trying to populate a basketball team.

1114
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,500
 Like you guys are going for the full Genghis con.

1115
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,380
 All right, just laying Maxwell for keeping my name out of her fucking mouth.

1116
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:41,500
 We're going to call that family cause she's like family to some of them.

1117
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
 Yeah.

1118
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:48,860
 Hey, position of the player that gets the MVP quarterback running back, wide receiver

1119
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:57,980
 tight end defensive player or any other, Oh, I am going to go wide receiver.

1120
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,660
 I'm going to go quarterback.

1121
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,860
 I think it's been, I think quarterback and I think it'll be if they, if they're, if they're

1122
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:11,660
 0.0% chance that it is going to be anything other than quarterback.

1123
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,780
 And I'll explain to you why this has driven me nuts and listening to everybody talk about

1124
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,940
 this shit.

1125
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:23,700
 The only way that a wide receiver wins is if they throw a touchdown, neither of these

1126
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,380
 teams have plays where they throw it.

1127
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,240
 Antoine Randall won it when the Steelers won and why, not because he caught a touchdown.

1128
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,820
 It's because he threw a touchdown.

1129
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:40,100
 If if JSN catches three touchdowns, Sam Darnold will get the MVP because he threw the three

1130
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,100
 touchdowns.

1131
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:46,500
 What if the other reason what, what if though, what if JSN catches three touchdowns and gets

1132
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:54,980
 an octopus with an end around run still Sam, here's why, because the narratives on both

1133
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,180
 sides with the quarterback matter.

1134
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,580
 It's either never stop dreaming.

1135
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,580
 Never stop hustling.

1136
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,900
 Sam Darnold is every sports movie.

1137
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:07,140
 What a great guy or welcome to the next 20 years of your life.

1138
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,540
 The Patriots are going to break back.

1139
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,060
 Drake may has now replaced Tom Brady in either way.

1140
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,580
 It's going to be them in Jacob's defense.

1141
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,220
 No one has scored an octopus and not won the MVP.

1142
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,220
 True.

1143
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,620
 Every true one person was a quarter.

1144
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:26,660
 Matt, do you have a, I'm so I'm saying Justin, you're taking quarterback.

1145
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,660
 Yes.

1146
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,220
 That all being said, tight end.

1147
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,220
 You have to take a specific position.

1148
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:36,980
 I think it should be just non QB as its own prop, but it has to be a specific position.

1149
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,140
 There are, there are quarterback versus other, any other position props, but I wanted to,

1150
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,140
 this is one of those multi-spotters.

1151
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,820
 So I wanted to have a few options.

1152
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:50,220
 If the same person intercepts Sam Darnold three times, that person might be the MVP.

1153
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,140
 Ooh, that would be DB.

1154
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,140
 Yeah.

1155
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,140
 So you're going, yeah.

1156
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,140
 Christian Gonzalez.

1157
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,780
 Are you trying to force it to JSN?

1158
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,780
 Yeah.

1159
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,780
 You're going to go to defense on that.

1160
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,780
 All right.

1161
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,780
 I like that.

1162
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,220
 That being said, their wide receivers are so athletic.

1163
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,780
 I almost feel like that would be hard to do, but it would require Sam Darnold shitting

1164
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,780
 the bed.

1165
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,780
 Like, hold on.

1166
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:13,780
 Oh, he's done repeatedly.

1167
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,780
 Nevermind.

1168
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,780
 Oh, no, come on.

1169
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:21,780
 Sam Darnold's got a flawless record in nationally televised games that are broadcast to millions.

1170
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,780
 He sure does.

1171
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,380
 Paul, who do you think is going to be the MVP?

1172
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,220
 I think it'll be a quarterback.

1173
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,220
 All right.

1174
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,220
 Paul on quarterback as well.

1175
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,180
 All right.

1176
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,060
 First scoring play of the game.

1177
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:39,920
 Will it be a Seattle field goal, a Seattle touchdown, a New England field goal, a New

1178
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,300
 England touchdown, or a safety slash anything else that might happen, which I don't think

1179
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,180
 safety is the only other thing, but we put other on there just in case something crazy

1180
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,180
 happens.

1181
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,820
 The referees award a point.

1182
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,580
 Maybe they enact the rouge on the last minute and we're just not aware of it, so.

1183
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:04,820
 I will be taking a New England field goal, is my guess, because I think Seattle wins

1184
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:09,380
 the first, Patriots drive it down the field and get an early field goal.

1185
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,140
 I'll say Seattle field goal.

1186
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,100
 I think that the New England offense sputters.

1187
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:21,300
 I agree with your opening, but I think the New England offense sputters and you get one

1188
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:29,460
 early, you know, squirt out, kind of run, but then still go position.

1189
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,540
 This is first score.

1190
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,540
 First score of the game.

1191
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,540
 Yep.

1192
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,620
 I say, yeah, I'm darn old Mike.

1193
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:42,020
 I mean, you'd look at that pass and people thought he had mono and he was out indefinitely.

1194
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:48,860
 Well, he's back, not since Patrick Mahomes, not, you know, they call it the kissing disease,

1195
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:53,420
 Mike, but I'll tell you what, the amount of smooches that I would give to Patrick Mahomes,

1196
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,700
 I'd risk it for the biscuit.

1197
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,540
 I say Seattle touchdown.

1198
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:05,540
 All right, Matt, we go to Seattle touchdown as well.

1199
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,700
 And Jacob, Seattle defensive touchdown.

1200
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,700
 Whoa.

1201
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,700
 Holy.

1202
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:17,420
 That is not, there are, there are other spots that have that as a breakdown using that,

1203
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:23,740
 that is one of my, that is one of my very real bets on this game as a defense or special

1204
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,740
 teams touchdown.

1205
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,260
 Oh, it should be.

1206
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,300
 I think it is live for both teams.

1207
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:36,580
 I like both teams secondaries and I am Dicey on both teams quarterbacks.

1208
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:40,260
 Number of players to attempt a pass.

1209
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,040
 The over-under is two and a half.

1210
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,060
 So well, a non-quarterback throw a pass over.

1211
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,060
 Yes.

1212
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,060
 Over.

1213
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,060
 Over.

1214
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,060
 Yeah.

1215
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,060
 Jacob and Justin on the over.

1216
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:54,060
 I am on the over as, oh, actually I'm going to take the under and be contrarian I think

1217
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,060
 this year.

1218
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:58,820
 Oh, I was just saying I'm going over as well.

1219
01:05:58,820 --> 01:05:59,820
 And Paul.

1220
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,820
 Good for able to take it to the next level.

1221
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:08,060
 And instead of having the live offensive lineman catch a pass, maybe the, the live offensive

1222
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,740
 lineman throws the pass.

1223
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,740
 To my right.

1224
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,220
 You run a counter, you run a counter, you hand it off to the left tackle who then throws

1225
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,540
 it to the right tackle.

1226
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,540
 Right.

1227
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,540
 Yup.

1228
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,700
 It'd be the most beautiful double tackle eligible play.

1229
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:29,300
 That sounds like something that Ben Johnson would think of after like his fifth line of

1230
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,500
 coke in the off season.

1231
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,020
 That's a bit too deep in a K hole.

1232
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,020
 Yeah.

1233
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,940
 Oh, do you think we're getting a non-quarterback?

1234
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:41,060
 Actually this could also also impact if one of the quarterbacks gets hurt and somebody comes

1235
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,060
 in for a player too.

1236
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,060
 Oh shit.

1237
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,060
 Oh, that's true.

1238
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:47,380
 Medical Ted medical Ted, let's say Drake may gets his bell rung.

1239
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,740
 And the next thing you know, you have whoever fucking comes up for, for them.

1240
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,740
 Who is their backup quarterback?

1241
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:52,740
 I don't know.

1242
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,740
 Either.

1243
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,740
 It's also Drake.

1244
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,740
 Damn it.

1245
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,740
 Yeah.

1246
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:06,260
 The Patriots I believe is a car, one of the cars, beep, beep, beep, beep someone related

1247
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:09,580
 to Derek or whatever.

1248
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:10,580
 It's Josh jobs.

1249
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,900
 And then it's, and then it's Tommy cutlets after that.

1250
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,100
 He's their Tommy DeVito is their third stringer.

1251
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,540
 Oh snap Jersey pride on the line.

1252
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:23,000
 All I need is two quarterback entries and he's in the game.

1253
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,940
 If Tommy DeVito comes in, we all become Pat's fans immediately.

1254
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:26,940
 Oh my God.

1255
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:33,340
 I mean, he was the accused guy too, so big Paul, you think in the over or the under on

1256
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,340
 that one over.

1257
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,340
 All right.

1258
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,700
 So I will be the Katrina on that.

1259
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,740
 I think the over is the good play, but I'm just taking the under for good measure.

1260
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,540
 Which quarterback will have the most passing yards in the game?

1261
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:46,700
 Sam Darnold is the favorite over Drake may for this proposition.

1262
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,060
 Oh, downtown Sam Darnold.

1263
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:57,380
 Come on super bowl MVP, Sam Darnold.

1264
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,380
 Let's go.

1265
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,700
 Take a dig up yards on interceptions.

1266
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:08,340
 Don't count for a passing really not in your book, maybe it's Sam Darnold.

1267
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
 Number one.

1268
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,340
 He is the number one.

1269
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:20,700
 I'm going to take Drake may just because I'd like to be on the underdogs in stuff.

1270
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,700
 It runs an oil.

1271
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,700
 Matt and Paul.

1272
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,700
 Do we have any liens?

1273
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,700
 Well, you know what they say?

1274
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,900
 The nucleosis is the powerhouse of the cell.

1275
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,980
 So I'll go Donald.

1276
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:36,620
 Yeah, I'm on Darnold because he's my pick indefinitely.

1277
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:41,220
 All right.

1278
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:46,780
 Will the final score be odd or even odd is the slight favor in this one.

1279
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:49,340
 The combined total score combined total score.

1280
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,340
 Yep.

1281
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,340
 So final scores.

1282
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,340
 Will it be odd or even?

1283
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
 All right.

1284
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:57,980
 These also, these are beds for which it's like it should come with a wellness check.

1285
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:06,140
 Like your employer, Mitzi should actually be dispatching people like you should be.

1286
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,900
 This is the one you're going to point out.

1287
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:13,300
 Not the coin prop partly that we built this is on the same level.

1288
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:18,940
 This is on exactly the same level as the coin should be a Trump executive order, everything

1289
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:26,060
 they're betting combined, they're betting up, up and down and over and under and when

1290
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,340
 army and Navy are playing even never Stevens.

1291
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:37,620
 So I'm going to go with even even never come to my attention that there's a combined RFK

1292
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,620
 jr.

1293
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,620
 Yeah.

1294
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,620
 Yeah.

1295
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,780
 You should not be batting these things unhealthy.

1296
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,780
 It's unhealthy.

1297
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,420
 Well, it's raw milk, raw, raw betting.

1298
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,100
 Prop betting has been linked to autism.

1299
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,380
 So we got to watch a good, more real than you would like to admit.

1300
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:03,540
 Even or odd odd Paul, even or odd odd.

1301
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,340
 I am on odd as well.

1302
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:13,020
 And like the ledge, I would jump off of if I were actually putting money on this.

1303
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:19,380
 All right, let's take a look here.

1304
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,060
 Which team will Drake bet on?

1305
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:30,180
 Drake is notoriously known to curse no singer, Drake from Toronto, the Canadian rapper, singer.

1306
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:36,620
 Now look, there is an argument that Drake might be feeling himself famously before he

1307
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,960
 got humiliated at the Superbowl by Kendrick Lamar being called a pedophile.

1308
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:47,500
 He was humiliated by a rapper by the name of Pusha T who turns out appeared in the Epstein

1309
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,140
 files last week.

1310
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,940
 Things are going well for Drake.

1311
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:58,720
 I think that he is going to bet on his friend's team, Robert Kraft.

1312
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,220
 I think he's going to bet on the Patriots.

1313
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,260
 I think he's going to be a pats money line guy.

1314
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,260
 I'm sold.

1315
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,260
 I'm riding with Justin.

1316
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,260
 Yeah.

1317
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,260
 That sounds right.

1318
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,260
 Wait, this is about Drake.

1319
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,260
 Who?

1320
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,260
 Drake will bet.

1321
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,260
 Who?

1322
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,620
 Who's in God's plan?

1323
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,620
 Yeah.

1324
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,620
 I should actually play.

1325
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:18,780
 Say I should put that in quotations because it'll be on stake and who knows if that's

1326
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,100
 actually his money or not.

1327
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:26,500
 So I'm going to go with the Seahawks because I think that Drake also missed time when he

1328
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,660
 was an actor because he had mono and so he has a brotherhood.

1329
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,660
 So he feels.

1330
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,860
 Yeah, their brothers and brothers, their brothers and mono.

1331
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:39,740
 I will be taking the Seahawks as well on that one because I think he likes chalk more than

1332
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,740
 anything.

1333
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,740
 So yeah.

1334
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,740
 All right.

1335
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,740
 Is that cocaine?

1336
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,740
 Is that what you're saying?

1337
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,740
 Chalk?

1338
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,740
 Yes.

1339
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,740
 Chalk.

1340
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:48,740
 Yeah.

1341
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,740
 Will the team that scores first win the game?

1342
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,740
 Yes.

1343
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:54,460
 Will the team that scores first win the game?

1344
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,460
 Jacob is on yes.

1345
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:56,460
 I'm going to take no.

1346
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,460
 I think maybe we can trade on this one.

1347
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,460
 No.

1348
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,820
 I mean, I bet on the Seahawks to do it.

1349
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:07,540
 And even though I bet the Patriots, that was an emotional lie because I'm hedging my bets.

1350
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,540
 I believe that the Seahawks are going to win.

1351
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:13,140
 And so I will say that Seahawks will score first and they will win.

1352
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:16,540
 That is also a bet you can make.

1353
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,540
 Yep.

1354
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,540
 Wait, is this better?

1355
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,540
 Do we do scores first?

1356
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,540
 I'm so confused.

1357
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,540
 No, this is, will the team that scores first win the game?

1358
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:27,140
 So not, so they have to score first and win the game.

1359
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,140
 Yes.

1360
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:32,860
 All right, Paul, you got to lean on this one.

1361
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,860
 Yeah.

1362
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:34,860
 I'll say yes.

1363
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,860
 All right.

1364
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,100
 I will be the only no on that equation.

1365
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:45,900
 Team to offer the team to have the first coach's challenge Seattle or New England to pick

1366
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:50,300
 them if it doesn't happen points out didn't bet never happened.

1367
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:55,660
 Patriots, Frabel, Frabel's got his, he's got an itchy challenge finger.

1368
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,660
 Frabel likes the challenge.

1369
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:01,420
 I'm going, I'm going to England as well.

1370
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,380
 I'll go Seattle just because I don't have strong feelings for it.

1371
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:10,700
 And I want to steal points from Jacob, Mike McDonald, right?

1372
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:19,100
 I wonder if he's got those changeables, I'll go Seattle.

1373
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:26,780
 I'm going to go to new England with Justin and color of Gatorade this on the coach at

1374
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:35,300
 the end yellow or we have orange, yellow or green, blue, clear or no bath and red or purple,

1375
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,300
 yellow or green.

1376
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,300
 That is Paul on yellow.

1377
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,020
 I want red or purple.

1378
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:47,980
 Jacob is on red or purple orange, just daring.

1379
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:48,980
 There's no green, right?

1380
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:53,620
 You showing through yellow is yellow, yellow, green, yellow, green are connected in the

1381
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,620
 same one.

1382
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,620
 Cause there's they're kind of close.

1383
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,620
 They are, but it's going to look like piss.

1384
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,400
 I don't think they want it to look like piss.

1385
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,860
 So I'm going to go unless Mike McDonald's like a fucking golden shower fetishist, right?

1386
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:07,100
 Is the players who are picking the Gatorade are really funny.

1387
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,100
 It's so yellow.

1388
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,100
 Oh no.

1389
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,100
 I'm embarrassed.

1390
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,100
 Yeah.

1391
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,860
 Boys, it's 98.6 degrees.

1392
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,860
 Exactly.

1393
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:21,300
 If, if, if, if R Kelly was the halftime show, I definitely mean yellow.

1394
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:31,780
 I'm going to go purple, red, purple will be there and I'm going to take blue.

1395
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,780
 I don't know why.

1396
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:34,460
 I just think blue could be fun.

1397
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,460
 Okay.

1398
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,460
 Okay.

1399
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,500
 Smurf fetish.

1400
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,500
 All right.

1401
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,500
 Will.

1402
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,500
 Yeah.

1403
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,500
 Now this one's going to be a funnel.

1404
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,500
 Let's throw back to the last Superbowl.

1405
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:53,380
 Will Seattle throw a pass from the Patriots or inside of the Patriots to yard line?

1406
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,420
 Will they tempt fate?

1407
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,860
 I will say yes.

1408
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,060
 They will redeem themselves.

1409
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:04,780
 So anyone who's not a, anyone who's not a sports person, stop listening to this podcast.

1410
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:12,700
 But this is a few years ago, last time I'm having to listen to it.

1411
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,700
 No, it was.

1412
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,700
 Yeah.

1413
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,700
 Yeah.

1414
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,700
 Yeah.

1415
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:20,260
 They, they opted to throw instead of head off to Marshawn Lynch, who was getting six

1416
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,260
 yards for tiny.

1417
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,260
 What's the difference?

1418
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:23,260
 Yeah.

1419
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,260
 Like I remember it.

1420
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,260
 I remember that ball.

1421
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:30,620
 Now it would make a lot more fucking sense than it did in that Superbowl because the,

1422
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:34,540
 the Patriots run defense wasn't what it is now, which is fucking excellent.

1423
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:38,900
 And the Seahawks said Marshawn Lynch, one of the greatest short yardage backs of all

1424
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,500
 fucking time.

1425
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:46,260
 So it was too clever by half for them to throw now throwing would be their best option.

1426
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,220
 Their best playmakers are a quarterback that can read really well.

1427
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:54,580
 And JSN, which they can throw a short pass that could be a safe one and let him try to

1428
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:57,140
 run it in with his, with his legs.

1429
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,460
 So I'm going to say, yes, I also, I think that's probably their best play within short

1430
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,040
 yardage.

1431
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,660
 Even note the time that jury said something nice about Sam Darnold.

1432
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,660
 I will.

1433
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,060
 I think they'll, I think they'll do it for the redemption arc.

1434
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,060
 I just think there's a chance that it won't happen at all.

1435
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:21,620
 So I'm going to go, no, oh yeah, I'm going to take the note because I don't know if they

1436
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,220
 ever get inside of the five yard.

1437
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,460
 I think they're going to skip a score.

1438
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,460
 It's going to be from a distance.

1439
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,060
 I think this is going to be more of a kick to point conversions count or is it only a

1440
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,940
 touchdown inside the two, two yard line.

1441
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,540
 No, that would not count because then two point conversion start at the two yard line.

1442
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,220
 So it has to be a play inside the two.

1443
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,220
 Yeah.

1444
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:40,300
 What is the illegal forward pass?

1445
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,700
 What if they throw an illegal forward pass on a two point conversion?

1446
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,600
 That would be, the play would be overturned.

1447
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,600
 So the play never happened.

1448
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,600
 So that passed.

1449
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:53,140
 No, it had to be, it had to be a, a penalty on the Patriots, right?

1450
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,260
 It would be like pass interference in the end zone.

1451
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,260
 Yeah.

1452
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,260
 Oh yeah.

1453
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,260
 You could do it.

1454
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:59,260
 If it's a pass interference, put it on that.

1455
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,260
 But no, cause then the ball is put on the two.

1456
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:01,260
 Have we already, have we already passed the point?

1457
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,260
 So it's the one.

1458
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,260
 It's the one.

1459
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,140
 I've already passed the point Mitzi because variable was famous for catching touchdowns

1460
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:07,660
 as a linebacker in super bowls.

1461
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,660
 We already did that.

1462
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,660
 Yeah.

1463
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,660
 We talked about that already.

1464
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,660
 Okay.

1465
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,660
 Thanks for paying attention though.

1466
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,740
 I was not D line, but we can modify it to just alignment if you want to do that.

1467
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,580
 So that way it's either side of the mall.

1468
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:22,300
 Did you go, did you go over the coin toss?

1469
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,060
 Who's playing in the game?

1470
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,060
 We're going to talk about the super bowl.

1471
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,100
 Oh, this is all hindsight betting.

1472
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,100
 All right.

1473
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,100
 Let's do one more.

1474
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,580
 And I think we'll be good for the good for the punk position player of the player to

1475
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,580
 score the first touchdown.

1476
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,580
 That's what I'm talking about.

1477
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,580
 Linebacker.

1478
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:45,840
 Ooh, wait, I already said, I already said CB.

1479
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,900
 So that is Matt and Jacob on defensive player.

1480
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,900
 Yeah.

1481
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,900
 I'll go with quarterback.

1482
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:53,900
 Sneak.

1483
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,540
 He'll still, he'll zip it in.

1484
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,180
 Drake may would be, that would be bad.

1485
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,180
 That would be legit.

1486
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:07,120
 And then pushing, I'm going to say wide receiver and I will go running back just to take the

1487
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,120
 full field there.

1488
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,120
 All right.

1489
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:13,060
 I think we've got most, um, um, will there be a safety?

1490
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,060
 I'm on the no.

1491
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,060
 Oh, nah.

1492
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
 Yes.

1493
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,060
 This is to be such a go-to.

1494
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,060
 Yeah.

1495
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,060
 I love that.

1496
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,060
 Yes.

1497
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,060
 For a long time.

1498
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,060
 I'm off of it now.

1499
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:25,820
 So Justin's are you asking anybody else on the yes on that one?

1500
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,820
 I'll do yes.

1501
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:29,780
 This is the first time to see Seahawks were in the Superbowl that started with a safety.

1502
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,780
 So let's, let's go with this.

1503
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,780
 Let's go with yes.

1504
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,780
 All right.

1505
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:43,380
 And uh, total number, uh, let's see here.

1506
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:46,100
 I think that should be everything from the sheet.

1507
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,300
 I don't think we need anything else.

1508
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,300
 I was going to do songs in the halftime show, but I have no clue what song is and isn't

1509
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,300
 a bad bunny song.

1510
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,660
 So I wouldn't know if he was singing the same song with the transition or if he's doing

1511
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,660
 different songs.

1512
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,660
 All right.

1513
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,660
 One more.

1514
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:59,660
 We're good.

1515
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,820
 Will an offensive play be scored on a fourth down?

1516
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,540
 Will the offensive team score a touchdown on a fourth down play?

1517
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:10,660
 So when they have to go down and score a touchdown on that, no, no is the heaviest favorite.

1518
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:15,620
 No, no, no, no.

1519
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,620
 I'm going to take the yes.

1520
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,140
 Cause I think there could be like a fourth and they've been doing some fourth down in

1521
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,140
 the red zone stuff.

1522
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,140
 That's been kind of creepy.

1523
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:28,420
 Four downs, I'm with you mids these days and there used to be so that's because I used

1524
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:31,780
 to always, I used to always bet on prime time games.

1525
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,060
 First score of the game will be a field goal.

1526
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:37,380
 It's always plus money happens more often than you think has happened less this year

1527
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,300
 because now they're going for it on fourth down inside the 30.

1528
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,580
 So they're, you know, it's, it's happening less.

1529
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:45,700
 Even though the kickers are getting better, the coaches are getting more aggressive.

1530
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,540
 So I actually had to stop betting that one going forward because I just kept losing my

1531
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,540
 ass on it.

1532
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:54,860
 Is there a bet on whether or not, uh, Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft will have been

1533
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:58,540
 inducted into the NFL hall of fame by the time the super bowl starts?

1534
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,700
 Uh, they both have not accepted enough votes.

1535
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,780
 I do believe I know that right now.

1536
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:08,980
 That's why I'm asking, do we know the hall of fame can overturn it any day?

1537
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:14,220
 The hall of fame is too busy to building a should do or Sanders statue outside because

1538
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,220
 he got a passing touchdown in the flag football exhibition at the all-star game.

1539
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:24,420
 So there's a prop bet for whether or not Belichick and craft will be in a love triangle with

1540
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,820
 an unnamed 23 year old girl yet.

1541
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,820
 Yeah.

1542
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:32,740
 Or if a craft is going to change it up and not take his private jet down to West Palm

1543
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:38,340
 beach first to get some handy J's before going to the, which you did last time.

1544
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:42,340
 It's a long, it's a long detour to go from the, on that flight from New England to make

1545
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:48,020
 a pit stop in Florida, if you've got a jet, the super bowl, he did that for, was not in

1546
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,020
 Florida.

1547
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:57,260
 There is a lot, there is a lot of crazy props that you can and can't bet.

1548
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,860
 Um, if you're in a state with legal sports betting, have fun if you're to stay without

1549
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:01,860
 it.

1550
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,500
 I don't acknowledge that you're doing it.

1551
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,500
 Exactly.

1552
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,500
 Good luck.

1553
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,500
 Good luck.

1554
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,500
 Good luck.

1555
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:14,260
 Talking to St. Lucia, have fun, have fun in the Caribbean and or the isle of man.

1556
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,260
 There we go.

1557
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,300
 Thank you so much.

1558
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,300
 Yeah.

1559
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,300
 Thank you guys.

1560
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,300
 Thank you Mitzi as always.

1561
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,540
 And where can they go to print out this form, uh, to take to their parties?

1562
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:30,180
 I will, I will clean this up and get the sheet done and I will throw it on the discord and

1563
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:37,060
 I will tweet it out at clean it and put it on threads under @mitzula on both MIT ZULA

1564
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,060
 on all platforms.

1565
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,060
 There you go.

1566
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,060
 If you're not big on the sport thing, or even if you are and you want some real fun bets

1567
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:47,860
 to play around with at your super bowl party, grab Mitzi's scorecard.

1568
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:48,860
 Yeah.

1569
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,940
 What I'll usually do is I'll make it so it's one or two page so you can put them together

1570
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,460
 and then you can just circle your, which ones you like that up, who has the most picks at

1571
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,460
 the end.

1572
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:57,460
 You've you're good to go.

1573
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,460
 And it's nice because it's got sports things.

1574
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,460
 It's got non-sports things.

1575
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,800
 It's got a little bit of everything for everybody.

1576
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,800
