 Or someone might call you on a phone
 Hey, Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go
 I think we brought this up before
 Stands on cool
 I actually have something
 Okay
 We're preaching fun I had a friend's mom
 Buy my kid cologne for his birthday. Oh, oh
 oh
 And your kid is 11 12. I
 Mean that's the age
 Cologne that is that is dracon war age
 That is I went through a brute phrase not dracon war
 Jacquard noir
 was definitely the cologne of choice when I was in high school I
 Grew up thinking that cologne was an old-fashioned notion like when I hear the word cologne
 I picture like, you know
 We don't use cologne. I've never used cologne. You don't use a scent
 No, no, neither of you. No
 so I went to Walmart yesterday with my lovely wife and
 Your anniversary trip our anniversary trip. No, we're going and getting our stuff, you know, and every time I'm in Walmart
 I make a point to go over to the perfume aisle and there is generic CK one. It's called you and
 I always grab a bottle of you because that is the scent I've been using for damn near 30 years and
 I use it every day and it's just been my scent of choice and it's cheap ish
 I always like CK one because I started with CK one and it's just what I chose and it's been my thing
 But I I don't go without it and I'm out as soon as I step out the shower. I hit a little something
 spritzle on the clothes
 rub the old
 Hands together boom boom boom freshen up you said hands and you showed wrists, which one is it wrists wrists wrists wrists? Yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, just putting colognes in your hands is really weird. That's gross. Yeah
 Right on my hand
 Fridge everything just like everything you grab just what I like that Paul's coffee cup just reeks of cow
 No, no, here's the thing you two have spent an inordinate amount of time with me
 And you've never noticed some overpowering odor coming from me. That's correct. I've never what I've noticed
 I don't have the greatest sense of smell but that's not to disqualify you not being a stinker room
 But but but on the other but I mean not all not me be a stinker room
 But not even me like I'm not sent forward like you don't go
 Oh
 Because there's people that wear cologne and you're like they were here five minutes ago, or maybe they're on their fucking way like you can
 Famously we called, you know a Wayne Newton had a crazy Lord had a crazy billowing
 Yes, pink pin style
 It's like a choo-choo the Wayne train came through
 And that's it when I hear cologne I think of like old-fashioned parties. I was dragged to in Monmouth County, New Jersey
 Where all the men put on dinner jackets and and had very their own stinks on them while they drank a lot of alcohol
 And I got well, that's it. It's a it's a disguise for stinks and I don't have to use much because I don't stink
 And I don't drink and I don't smoke. That's the other thing too
 If I drank and smoked it'd be I'd need something more powerful than CK one because that does not hide shit
 Right, but I'm curious like I just I just personally never thought to
 Ever where my wife never mentioned it. She doesn't do a lot of perfumes either. She might get a little bit of something
 She just nice lotions and things like that. Sure, like we and then I use like
 a pleasing natural musk
 Always say about your wife. That's what she says. That's all that people talk about to her. It's just her must
 Pleasing natural much. Yeah, she's like it when I tried when I tried talking about her must she's like get in line
 So many people just talking about my musk all day
 If you send me an email is she selling her urine for hunters boots, is that what's going on now? Yes
 Attracting attracting dancers in the wild that they can yes the bow and arrow. No, it's hunter Biden
 She's she's putting her piss on hunter Biden's boots go to hunt hunting boots piss Vegas and you'll see my wife's website right there
 Or
 But I'm curious if like what I'm curious about the people if if you know, I'm in my late 40s, right?
 So we do late 40s early 40s late 30s
 It is more or more people wearing cologne in general
 Like or am I like am I wrong and thinking that was an old-fashioned notion because to see it come back with younger kids
 Is interesting to me, but maybe I'm just wrong and a lot of people were column
 I want to know in the chat. We have enough people here. I wear cologne
 Paul's a cologne guy
 Jacob even you you get spritzed up when you go out to you don't never thought you never think to go cologne
 No, I never do cologne. I'll do like maybe a little aftershave or something
 Okay, but even even that like I don't want I don't want an aftershave that smells. Yeah, I don't like having a scent. Yeah
 Like in high school there were times that I had cologne like there were there. I definitely put cologne on in high school and stuff
 I think by the time I was in college though, I was done with cologne
 So sounds like there are some three guys have chimed in they all wear a little cologne like a very like they're talking about Paul style
 Oh very little a little amount of all right a little dabble. Do you?
 Do you do the clown you walk through the cloud?
 I use it. It's honestly it's kind of like aftershave
 So, you know cuz you know, I dry shave
 Yeah, I'm not dry dry by use a little bit of water
 I use a little bit of water and all razors now have a little lube strip on them
 So it's not really dry shaving but nobody likes a lube strip more than me
 Yeah, so, you know a little bit of that and I basically after out after the shower. It's almost like
 aftershave, you know
 Something keeps the bumps chill and whatnot. And yeah, and I spray it right on. I don't I don't do the cloudy walkthrough thing
 Okay, according to to this Gen Z is big into cologne. Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying
 It's definitely the young people it's back in for sure. So it's just a generation perhaps. That's it. That's it. I'm wondering
 And also this is talking about having a fragrance wardrobe, which is apparently a popular thing
 Which is multiple fragrance fragrances in your collection and you select the fragrance that you feel is most appropriate for that that day
 Well, I was like something that but that feels like something that happened to me. I never get one of anything
 I definitely feel like maybe you could do a little laughter what I was like I have like eight beard oils
 I don't use in my house different places
 Cuz I like go get the go get the purple bottle off of daddy's smell shell
 You haven't gotten into the beard oil habit yet. My wife didn't like it
 I kissed her once with beard oil on and she was like pissed off and I was like, all right
 Well, it was it too much. Yeah, it's easier to have beard dandruff than it is to to put accidental beard stink on my wife
 So I like doing the beard oil when my beard is a little longer
 I don't like when I've got I've got my beard trimmed very short right now
 I like it when it's when I've got it a little fluffy and then I like the beard oil
 That's part of my daily regimen to
 Sebastian Menescalco. Am I saying the name right? The special medicine. I'll go I think is that stand-up comedian? Oh
 He did a live episode on Amy Poehler's podcast. It's really great highly recommend
 and
 he wears
 Two colognes one on the front and one on the back
 Sebastian come on
 So this is what I want to talk about like this is coming and going I can't imagine
 I mean, that's a lot of work to build up a cologne
 wardrobe because
 Wardrobe because everybody's body chemistry reacts differently to sense
 So you got to find the one that that hits home and for me one just doesn't
 Doesn't rock the boat like whatever I oh whatever I got going on
 Jives with ck1, but there have been times when I've tried a little like Burberry and whatnot
 And it just it's like the vibe is off kid. Yeah, I
 Think I'm gonna start just taking tiger snake whiskey and using it as aftershave and just letting that be my my musk
 That's not wrong. Do is take a drink of it, and then it will just ooze out of your pores
 Fucking how much that fucking Duke Cannon shit that I stock on the target shelves every day
 Yeah, it's all bourbon barrel infused shit. So you might as well
 It's all bourbon. This is another another cologne. It's it soaps. It's it's aftershaves
 It's a shame. I was gonna say same with a beard oil as well. Yeah, all of it all of it is
 oakwood bourbon
 Barrel infused shit. Yeah, everything smells like a basement in, Kentucky
 Kind of does it kind of does you know?
 Yeah, well, that's interesting. So do you are you are you encouraged by your son getting into scents now?
 Or no, I was way too early fucking 12 fuck off. No, I
 Too much you hate it because it's your kids growing up mice exactly. My son was starting to look so adults
 Yeah, and then he had to get braces and I literally picked him up from the orthodontist and I was like, oh, thank God. Oh
 He looks like a kid. Oh, thank goodness. He was literally just starting to just look like just a
 Just a man. Yeah, it was yeah, really really that had me up. I know it's inevitable insurance the other day
 Well, he's been doing that since eight
 I guess first he convinced me that my current insurance was not was not good enough
 Healer is there he is unlicensed and and that is not FDIC insured just so you know, but
 Like the FDIC is gonna be existing in like your son will pay out though
 Automobile accident. I feel like your son's gonna take care of that's true. That's true
 Gear a scoop has said braces the puberty and virginity extender
 Certainly helped in my situation. Oh boy
 It does not seem to be a deterrent
 Socially at all not anymore. Yeah, I don't think so. No, that's everybody like all kids now have braces
 No, yeah, they do most kids do and I feel like it's a much more common thing now
 It wasn't completely outrageous for me. You know a lot of people still had braids. Oh, they're also doing them younger
 Yes, that's for sure. Yes
 It's very rare that a kid in high school has braces now. They do them all in the middle school years
 Yeah, they do that because younger gums it works faster. Yeah
 Yeah, Oh
 Garry scoop is saying our braces
 smaller than they used to be
 Maybe you're scooping the chat is saying that braces are super tiny and minor now. I think they're asking
 The things that they're able to stick to the teeth
 That day yeah, they seem smaller to me. I just got a big gold grill
 It's just a big it just holds those teeth and just move it. I have you seen those people that wear their grills too long
 And it fucks up their teeth forever
 It's the nastiest thing they just keep they keep them in it's like months and it's because it's a visible version of Invisalign
 Oh, no, but it's not even no not invisible. It's like just not they're not
 No, that's what I'm saying is the grill is acting like just a visible
 Invisalign, but it's just not even helping anything
 Gross doing what braces do but in the wrong direction
 Galactic president scooper star McScoops a lot has a great question in the chat
 Did the boys convince you or did the HOA convince you to do anything about the giant skeleton in your front yard?
 Giant skeleton is still up in my front yard
 And that's the way on the with we keep joking that we're gonna put a Santa Claus hat on it
 I've been HOA will not approve of that
 Most of the problems can't ask permission you can't ask permission. Oh, no, we're not gonna ask permission, but I just
 I think we just still get fine. That's what I mean
 The skeletons head is bigger than mine, so I have some big Santa Claus hats, but not big enough for the skeleton
 So I got I got I gotta go out. I'm sure it's just a quick search on
 The internet will get me a giant Santa hat for the for the head
 But plus I think a little saccharine is on this back there
 But the problem is simply that it's a two-person operation and my wife and I first I was away and then my wife's so busy
 That like we literally we literally just huddled up right now for like just to finally have an hour to play out the next two weeks
 I have no idea what we're gonna
 Right. Oh good news
 Home Depot sells a Santa hat to go with that skeleton. Yeah, there's no doubt. There's no doubt
 What about putting in the pool? I did a Google search for giant skeleton hat and and that popped right up
 Could he just live in the pool?
 That's pretty great, yeah, that's pretty great
 Yeah, those bones will probably dissolve in the glory. You think maybe I don't know. It's probably not
 It's probably not good for the or it'll activate the spell that lies within the skeleton and he will simply grow magic
 An animated one way or another something's going down. Yeah, it's not one way or another. It's not gonna be safe
 It's gonna be unfortunate. Well, I got through yet another round of eyeball testing. Oh
 And it was kind of crazy
 Went in. Yep. This is an eyeball. And yeah, I'm certified eyeball and
 We've done every test that we can except for the dye test
 So he was like you wanna just do the dye test and get it done
 I'm like great so they could detect any possible swelling or whatever. I'm like sure
 Yeah
 So they had to put dye in me and then quickly get a bunch of pictures of my eyes and then we looked and no
 There's no swelling. Okay, so everything's everything's written off except I have
 Crummy veins and there's really nothing I can do about that
 Until things go take catastrophically wrong. So I'm going back in in seven weeks to see if things are better or worse the yellow dye
 Yes, it was very low
 So as you know as they're doing it and everything they're like so you're gonna notice discoloration in your urine and stool
 That's gonna last a day or two. I'm like, okay cool
 but then I'm getting ready to go back to my car and I might well better hit the head before I go and
 Swear to god. It was the secret of the ooze
 So it was fluorescent fluorescent that's what it's supposed to be it was fluorescent I was like
 Cooler shoot now your urethra
 Yeah, yeah that well and I'm afraid of no ghost it was well, okay
 Actually, I share this is this this is too much. Wait a minute. Hold on the things that you shared without this question is been
 Paramount to this podcast. I can't believe whatever you're about to say
 seems
 I've been peeing for a day basically and it was still pretty bright and I was like
 Well, this is this is throughout. Yeah, this is this is corrupting everything
 so in the in the in the
 interest of science I
 Had to bust one out and see what was going on
 And I'm here to tell you that permeated
 I literally fired off some straight up
 My no-no-no-no video my no nut November was done done a while back
 But but I also thought I also thought not only in the interest of science
 But also I thought probably good to get this out of every part of my system that it could be lingering. Yeah time to flush, right?
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's what you know, just general maintenance
 What's going on?
 There's a thing as I'm doing this as I'm thinking about it how many times
 Have because guys are the worst
 How many times have guys had a die?
 situation and
 Then had a romantic interlude not long after and what does that do to the possible children conceived?
 let alone
 the kind of
 Intimate moment you're having like oh, I thought you I didn't realize that's where you're going with this
 I thought you were concerned about the fluorescent pearl necklace that I was giving
 After getting my I died
 I thought I thought you were worried about your gym socks glowing in the dark when you try to go to sleep or something
 Here's the thing
 Yes, so this is this is the other thing too. It's like
 is this dangerous and
 If it's not that dangerous
 Then I think we've found a weird
 Porn subculture thing here, maybe a kink. Yeah, right people who fire
 Upside down spider-man
 I'll tell you who else has fluorescent semen

 Mike Mills will be doing all of them and then we'll be rotating between Derek Hughes
 Who I'm so excited to be doing a show with Derek is Matt King's number one filling guy had an awesome run on America's got
 talent if you're watching our stuff, he he's just killer everywhere and
 We're also gonna Nick the fats coming back for one of the legs of the tour also
 Ruben Morland who a lot of people don't know he's actually been killing it in fringe festivals. One of the nicest guys
 It's the big goofy redhead. I love Ruben. I'll find out with him a bunch of times
 I'm so excited to be sharing my first shows with him. He's so pretty super funny
 So yeah, very very excited each shows a four magician lineup
 Of comedy magicians and it's gonna be super fun. That sounds wonderful. Yeah
 magicians I watched the most recent fool us the other day and
 that cat with the with the fucking card trick who
 Who was it close talk to him like the day before something like that to get him on Paco a crowd though a guard. Yes
 Wasn't even gonna try to remember his name. He was amazing. So I was
 This is a abracadabra spoiler. So I but I guess you know, we're here
 That is the reason why you don't see me on this season of
 I was in the chamber as an emergency guy
 we lost a couple of people to do for different reasons and
 I was being
 Primed up to do some kind of version of my card stab or ring trick routine for fool us and then all of a sudden
 It was like no, never mind. We got this guy and of course, I was like
 You know and I think he came out and he was he just killed he just killed so yeah, he was there just as a friend
 Helping out John Carlos Scalia
 Who's who aired an earlier episode this season and they used to have done a two-person show with each other in Spain
 And so it was another thing. It's like the same way they got
 Danny D or tease on they simply said like you're here. Like you're right here. What are you? Why are we not doing something?
 Just do it. And so he showed him a couple stuff. And yeah, he went on there and fooled the shit out of him. So yeah
 And so did John Carlo. So and I've worked with John Carlo a bunch on the Princess cruise ships
 he's the nicest guy and
 As someone said on abracadabra, maybe the only person who can just totally successfully use charm as misdirection
 Just just totally can just be so
 Charmingly goofy and whatever that you just you just take your eyes off of everything he's doing. Yeah with his hands
 It's it's really they're they're both just killer killer guys. Yeah, they're great
 Yeah, he was amazing. Yeah, this is a good the episodes. I've seen a fool us this season, man
 They it is it is a good season to fool us. It is we don't know what the future holds
 You know, we they took the season and split it in half, right?
 So the air 10 episodes and gave like a big four-month gap and then now they're airing the other 10 episodes
 The reruns get the same exact ratings as the new episodes, which is usually a bad sign for TV things
 We've done over 140 episodes
 so there's certainly enough to syndicate to the end of time and that includes getting rid of three seasons of
 The kovat seasons, which they don't seem to rear as much
 Studio audience. Yeah, I think those episodes are now covered with the last two seasons
 And so I don't know and also what is CW in this modern media landscape?
 Is anything it's it's a really weird is not been gobbled up by any of the major streamers. It's still its own app
 It's still a network television show which means it still airs on rabbit ears
 and
 So I don't I don't we don't we don't know so we so it's all it's all up in the air
 I I just don't I don't know what anything in TV means anymore
 No that point now. We're like all of our experience in in television entertainment
 Doesn't mean anything at all. The models certainly aren't there anymore that we now came up with. It's so strange
 It really is a very strange time specifically for television and and yeah, it is it is weird. And so yeah
 You know
 Would Penn and Teller wants to do another season would would they want to maybe try a new show somewhere else?
 I don't know, you know that kind of stuff. So I mean we did
 11 seasons and secretly like 13 and a half seasons if you do it by a regular episode count
 And so that's just a whole lot of TV and a whole lot of cool stuff. So I I don't know and how
 It's that many seasons over how many years now?
 gosh
 It's over a decade. Yes, it's definitely over a decade. Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to think when I started well
 Yeah, so my kid was born
 Yeah, it's been a decade. It's been a decade. Oh, there you go
 Yeah, yeah, so my kid was born my second kid was born during the first season. So oh, yeah
 They're a supernova girl season one was 2011. Yeah
 There you go
 Yeah, so I mean it's that's
 That's a run. Yeah. Yeah, he's coming over
 I'll talk about the original season of air in England too. So season two is where I kind of start the American
 Season all right, it's been ten years since it was refired up in season two and goes on. Yeah. Yeah
 Are they thinking about a new show man?
 There always are they always are they always are
 Yeah, the new show that they're talking about doing it. It's not gonna be as difficult to get a trophy
 It's just fool Matt Donnelly. Yeah. Yeah, it's just just gonna be like if you don't get one
 It's gonna be like what's wrong with you
 Injured piff, yeah
 No, it's strange it's strange to be busy enough that I don't need it, you know
 I think I think that was always like the weird thing of like all right any time full scale. I was like, oh good
 That was always a nice nice thing
 and I think also like
 I've really gotten like it like I heard I
 Heard me something about another magician. They're gonna put they're putting together TV special for a magic
 Okay, and I'm not necessarily on this magician's radar, but like people around him are and I am actually like I
 Think because we're gonna show like I have I understand magic for TV versus magic for magic sake pretty well
 And it's like probably true and I was like I should be at least get a phone call from one of these people, you know
 It's like and so I am a little bit like oh wait if this shows over I need to figure out how to put
 Myself out there more as a possible right like, you know
 Lower level producer. Yeah. Yeah, cuz of like I really do I did learn so much
 Sure show and I think I could help a lot for something like that. But yeah, yeah, we'll see
 I bet you could buy the CW
 It's on the block
 Yeah, my improv classes are going great. I just got done with my first
 level one
 four-week class and nice
 I had a couple students who were so jazzed that they wanted me to keep teaching and go on to level two and
 I was like, well, I don't have a level two class scheduled right now, maybe next year and they were like nope
 Let's get this going and so they contacted
 and and made a made a
 thing and and and got
 got things moving forward and
 holy shit
 Justin was up for it and
 They've got five students registered so far out of my class and they're gonna get a couple more hopefully and oh good
 By the this next month. I'll be teaching two classes a week. So whoa
 Yeah, I'll be doing a level one. I'm still doing on my level one again and a level two. So it's great
 So we are doing what I was hoping to do which is build out
 Improv community in Pittsburgh. It's gonna take some time, but it's gonna happen. I believe we'll see. Oh nice
 Yeah, so that's going really well
 Thank You bossy. Yeah, it's uh
 it's just a you know, it's what I've been hoping for and I'm still teaching the occasional free class over there at the
 Pduty network, so that's gonna happen. So I'm gonna go do that next Tuesday
 Then the Tuesday after that provided everything's lined up will be rocking and rolling with the Tuesday classes, too. So
 very encouraged with that
 Let's go. Yeah making some more headway with getting getting further away from retail gigs and more and more into
 this thing, although
 today
 today we went and bought some stuff for Anne's garden and in the
 Complex where we ship in no, we did I know the complex where we went. What do you know?
 There's a brand new bricks and minifigs store opening up and I'm like, oh shit
 So for those of you who aren't familiar, this is a chain a franchise that actually deals in used Legos and repurposed leg
 so
 Uh-huh. So I think they're not gonna open till summer next year
 It says or or spring at least so I'm gonna work like I'm gonna try I think
 Might as well right if the if the compensation is comparable
 What the fuck? Yeah, I could spend all day fucking around with Legos and hosting kids Lego parties rather than
 Shoveling coal, you know, this is gonna be like Ellsroth at the weed place
 You're just gonna rise up there without trying and you're just a king, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man
 Did you hear about the weed stuff though? That's that was if my first thought was Ellsroth today. What happened?
 No, they have our Congress has decided to outlaw weed again
 Nationally what? Yes
 Couldn't possibly be a distraction from other things. But yeah, that's what they put in that fucking
 Open the government back up bill that weeds gonna be illegal nationally in 26 again
 I know right. Yeah, why?
 Why indeed it's almost as though they're trying to sabotage the country
 It's almost as though they're trying to just bring it to the brink of no, I mean, I mean like, okay
 Sure, because I can't I've
 It's a weird time and Paul's more right than wrong about this crazy shit, but
 Like
 Like okay, why isn't the government bill is what I mean?
 So in other words, why was it allowed to be part of the opening up of the government again?
 Like is it helping prisons? Is it helping? Yes. Do you know what I mean? That's exactly it. It's helping private prisons getting private
 Yeah, getting more people because private prisons are complaining that they're not getting enough people so they need something else criminalized again and
 the liquor industry wants their
 Liquor money back from the people who are have found out that weed doesn't make you want to kill your family as much as
 alcohol does
 Feel like I still want to kill my family as much I don't know man
 But you're like, oh the knife's all the way over there and my family's all the way over there
 I'll do it tomorrow either of them next to chips
 Oh my god, Mike or my family
 Totally calling me out said I can't work at the bricks and minifigs place because I kept saying Legos when it's just Lego. Oh
 No, it is true. They are they are pedantic about that. Although bricks and minifigs
 So I don't have to say fucking Lego at all. I just bring your bricks and minifigs. How about that?
 Figs is a weird. I've never heard that term
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, bricks and minifigs many figures. Yeah, many figs. Yeah bricks and minifigs is a like I said, it's a it's a franchise
 So yeah, that's what they call the minifigs
 Any Lego figures? Oh minifigures figs is for figures. Yeah. Yeah minifigs. Yeah
 Not when you said bricks and minifigs at first I was picturing some like tawny like upper middle class place for like bricks
 Like brick brick like masonry. Oh how funny trees and like beautiful things like that
 Nope, I'm talking about tiny lot of cologne a lot of tiny tiny little Lego men
 That's all it is teensy little Lego men. These are looking at this stuff here
 I don't know if this is about weed as much as it's about hemp
 Well, it's saying THC products. So it's no products that contain a certain amount of THC
 or
 or what's the other active thing that's going on to the
 Any of it, but anyway last night the Senate passed a continuous CBD CBD. That's it along with oh, there you go
 Yeah along with three appropriation bills one of which an agricultural appropriation bill effectively shut down the US hemp industry
 well
 That's one way to put it
 Growers use the the plant cannabis sativa to produce both hemp and marijuana blah blah blah. I
 Don't know this weird. It's fucking weird like I'm looking through it now
 I can't really read through the whole thing on the air right now, but like I'm looking through it right now and good
 That's true. I guess
 We are nothing if not a marijuana forward
 Thing like I I am the least smoky of all of us as in I have never I have never imbibed and even a gummy
 You know, I'm just not a drug dude
 But I I am very much an advocate of of all of it because you know
 I've seen the good effects it can have on people and it can make people feel good and
 mitigate pain I
 first of all that once lived in the Virgin Islands, so we're going to go over my partaking of weed, but
 What in the Virgin Islands?
 You know, you know, you don't live in a tree house in the Caribbean and not smoke weed
 Residents you lived in was constructed of help
 Was just weed just weed. Yeah, just lived in weed. Yes
 It like literally like in a movie like washed up we went I'm at a giant garbage bag of a wash up on shore
 Everybody was it just like Christmas we made oh that ended up leading because it wasn't good weed
 So then leading to my friend Colin making what I called instead of weed cookies
 He made weed briquettes is what I call them. They came out green. It was like it was like your it was like your gym
 Sock Paul. It was neon green
 And they were so strong people accused him of lacing them with other illicit substances
 Which is hilarious just because he was Rosseferian and like really just believed in like just it was just skunk weed
 He's like no, it's such a density cooked into the cookie. It was like sugar. Yeah
 We were there was more weed than sugar. You're just feeling the power of jaw. It was weeks of the craziest behavior
 Pandemic
 Company but I bet nobody nobody got hurt nobody gotten a brawl
 People got people got paranoid and I'm stuck on like a little island key like a story island
 Like for like hours because they were afraid to go back in the water
 They were worried about their ability to swim to shore so there was an incident there was an incident of survival nobody was hurt
 It's it's you know, and like you said, I hate that I'm the diet of exposure on that island
 Injured before dying. I hate that I'm more right than wrong on this stuff
 but I think you know weed is such as such a good calming effect on a lot of people and just chills folks out and
 Alcohol just get some amped and people are gonna turn to whatever substance they need to
 Day, I actually thought like I thought I thought
 Legalizing weed in Nevada wouldn't be that big of a deal wouldn't change things and it right was I wrong?
 Like it changed things everything you can't walk down the street without smelling it exactly
 I don't enjoy the effect that weed has had on Vegas
 But my answer to that is not jail my answer to that is not and let's get also nice involves
 But also the it's capital punishment. That's that's a kill people
 Yeah, the fact that you can't walk down a Las Vegas Street without smelling weed
 Tells you if you're not brain dead that oh fuck
 They are selling tons of this shit
 This is an industry the stereotype of old cab drivers as they would take
 Whatever
 Yeah, but they would you know, not the one you asked for but the one that paid the cabbies the most
 Yeah, right and that has now changed to weed dispensary. Yeah
 Yeah, well remember how we were talking even before like we there's before I moved there was still a real
 Possibility that we could have been really fun
 dispensary
 Entertainment right? Yeah, there's gonna be the easiest job in the world
 exactly
 A couple of places here have tried the the cannabis lounges and nobody has figured it out yet
 Yeah, how to do the lounge? Yeah, what's the time?
 I'm just like hanging around and getting high somewhere else. It isn't that appealing to people. It's not it's not it's not working with stand-up lineups
 That's for sure. Well, I suppose if if one of the major side effects is paranoia, you don't want to be in a strange place
 well, this is that they have all these different strands now that one can you know, the
 Paranoid man, this is just gonna give you a real mellow trip. Yeah
 Yeah, and it tastes like ice cream. So let's go. I just saw a video
 Some cannabis celebration and somebody had rigged up an apparatus where they had a giant
 Stack of weed inside what amounted to a stovepipe and that stovepipe was directly
 built on top of and Jerry rigged to and taped up to a leaf blower and
 So somebody lit all the weed with a blowtorch in the top. Oh, yeah, the stovepipe they turned on a leaf blower and it just
 For like two minutes straight just billowed weed smoke
 It just looked like a haunted house
 We call that the dandy isn't that dandy? It's the dandy is that it was
 Crazy, it was crazy
 It was wild to see and just people just getting face full of weed smoke from a blower
 From a leaf blower. The whole room was just coated. Yeah. Yeah
 So but yeah that real that really bummed me out this morning and my first thought was Ellsroth because he has found something
 He's exceptionally good at he's enjoying the shit out of it. He's trying to entrepreneurialize with it
 All right, he's become a true character man. Right and this is the machine, right? This is exactly why I'm like that's America
 That's fucking capitalism true. That's that's get it done and they're just putting a kibosh on it
 Then I guess I guess we should fuck. I'd be curious. He's probably working which why he's not here, but be curious
 But that's what they're saying what Ellsroth saying what they're saying at his work. I'd be good. Well, we've got a day here
 Maybe we can try and get him on tomorrow because we're doing it again tomorrow
 Yeah, maybe we could get him in to chime in cuz yeah
 I would love to hear the initial cuz and I'll give it a day to stew cuz it just hit today
 So, uh, yeah, let's let's hear it. Let's hear it
 Speaking of hitting today
 So the the new federal funding legislation moving through Congress is expected to impact the sale the sale of hemp driven THC products
 But not state regulated sales of recreational metal medical marijuana
 Medical yes, it's CBD
 It looks like though from this from this other article that I'm looking at over here from the cannabis business times comm
 Oh, you can't sounds that they sound very CBT. Let's not let's right you can a business. It's right there
 Can a business times it should be candid times and it's definitely looking at it again. I was wrong

 Intoxicating CBT and industrial hemp products according to the summary me. Well now me while kratom runs rampant, right?

 Let's fuck everything. Yeah. Yeah, let's mess with it doesn't make it

 Okay, we already owned
 They they own the biggest chunk of it and then like paramount and a couple of other
 Groups like that own like 12 percent stakes here and there. Oh, no. No, I think I understood that they're yeah
 I mean, I knew they had some organization behind them and next are I didn't know was next are but yeah
 They're already the big dog, but but doesn't but it's sure that they're there's still an independent
 Independent. Yeah, there's still an independent streamers. It's really important was on pointing out and right
 I'm just I'm confused now now that I know that why they're still an independent streamer, right?
 yeah, it seems like they would already have been looped into other things that their
 Owners own right and they're not that's weird and they're not which like the facts
 They're not already part of the paramount plus or peacock or something like that makes it kind of weird
 Yeah, and they yeah, all right. Yeah. That's fine. Oh, let's do a little scoop mail. Let's do
 Scoop
 Dear Neapolitan since this podcast is one of the reasons why I met the love of my life
 I wanted to share more happy news about our little family. You're welcome. This is this is a Manu
 Hi, Manu Manu. Mrs. Cincy scoop a couple weeks ago at the end of October. Mr. Cincy scoop
 And I welcomed our Dippin dot
 Little boy who was at 99 who was at the 99 percentile of size during most of the pregnancy
 Turns out to be great because he arrived three weeks early. We were both fine and healthy after the birth
 I had my first hospital stay and do not recommend for anyone who needs to rest baby is growing getting nice and fat
 He likes to sleep so much that we need to pester him every few hours to feed him
 Then he feeds for about an hour straight until he falls asleep in the cycle repeats
 That's a baby after my own my days off exactly that is my life
 Most days are good, but the little one is getting the hang of being a human
 So other days are a little more challenging overall
 We are very happy the experience as a first-time parent is interesting to say the least
 Honestly, the broken sleep is not the worst part for me dealing with other people's bullshit comments and opinions are the real test on my nerves
 Since your advice is always impeccable. I come to you for solutions on how to deal with the worst offenders
 I love these questions. Oh boy starting strong with questions about the baby's circumcision status
 I don't think it's appropriate to talk about my baby's gonna tell you at all, but I guess I'm the weird one
 What do I even say to that?
 Then how do I shut down the comments about the next baby?
 There will be no next baby and it genuinely made me sad hearing these those remarks only one week postpartum. That's
 Insane. That's the same you about the next baby while you're still healing from getting the first one out of you
 Well for the first question you can tell them straight up say no Microsoft got rid of Clippy
 They faced Clippy right out yeah Clippy is gone. So that's just not a not an option anymore. Yeah
 Yeah, okay talk about their genitalia
 I'm just gonna say the short clippy answer is you know, like why are you thinking about getting one?
 The the the bold one is to say like are you asking me about my child's penis is that what we want to talk about
 right now
 right
 Yeah, how about we just talk about other aspects of their genitalia instead of the tip of their feet?
 Let's talk about the shaft. Oh, it doesn't have to be your child
 Turns out they're gonna take any kid to the oil and they'll just don't just nip the tip
 I remember once I'm having a guy, you know, whatever being like no, don't circumcise. I think I think it's circumcised
 I end up having to get circumcised at 12 because of an issue or whatever and I regret you know
 I wish I wish we didn't get it done or something like that and I turned to the person I said
 You think it's you didn't stop fucking did you and then he laughed and I was like, it just seems to me like
 People try to compare it to like the oppressive like
 Circumcision of women that happens in like different countries that's a little sure. It's a it's a lot
 It's a lot different than that. It's a lot different
 Yeah, for the most part it is a sanitary thing but also like it's nobody's fucking business
 Yeah, yeah mind your business. This is exactly this exactly goes right to this
 marijuana stuff
 mind your business and
 Let business mind its business. It's outrageous the stuff the talking out of both sides are fucking heads with this
 We want we want business to rock and roll and we're gonna fuck with business constant so stupid
 I mean, yeah, though a nice response to it is
 You know as much as I would love to talk about my baby's dick with you. Why don't we talk about anything else? I
 I've
 Say this, you know, this is the thing that this is like a life lesson from improv that I moved to real life
 Which is don't get stuck having conversations. You don't want to have right?
 So like if you're on stage in a scene and you and you see partner don't feel like you're enjoying the scene either one of you
 Do anything to change the subject until you are talking about something you want to talk about and the audience will be relieved
 right and so I
 Had if you simply go like oh, I don't want to get into this at all
 Yeah, if you just say that and then just beat silence
 That person will not pester you about it. You they will change. They do
 Get him out of there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but simply sound like oh, I don't want to get into this with you at all
 Not right now. I don't feel like talking about it, you know anything along those lines
 Just just shut the person up, you know
 But you owe it to yourself to like do not have conversations
 You don't want to have if you don't want to talk about your child's genitalia to somebody you do not talk about it
 and if you're confident and calm and almost quiet about it that person will just freeze up and
 Yeah, you one of you will move on
 Right, right. Yeah, like somebody will continue the conversation or the conversation will end and either way I feel like that's fine
 So also the people are asking about the next baby a week after the this baby they're asking about the next baby
 Are you gonna pay for it? I have another baby. You're gonna you're gonna pay the bills for that, baby
 Yeah, I don't know. I'm reading in chat. Are you worried about my kids? I'm reading in chat same
 My brother's wedding was just two weeks after my son
 Two weeks after I had my son and everyone had a comment about not circumcising him
 and
 My aunt kept saying well, my husband was so I'm like not gonna talk about my kids or husband's penis
 Yeah, yeah, like I like it's really like they'll never be able to follow up on their hypothesis, right? Right?
 No, they have no medical background
 Idea for this for whatever they're bringing up. They have no
 Factual basis for it at all. You know what can be really funny. Tell them you're having it added on to
 Tell extending. Yeah, tell them you're adding four inches. My baby is gonna have a five skin
 We're doing like a chip clip with like fishing weights on it and we're just
 We're gonna stretch this thing out it's gonna be like the bungs of the rungs of the Notre Dame Bell up there
 It's gonna be like being really really really they're not gonna be able to circumcise my kid because it would be a major
 Surgery based on how much they'll be removing the tip of his cock is gonna look like the ladies lips at Mar-a-Lago
 What I mean to say is like most people are concerned about it from the sake of like
 sensitizing the children that the kids miss or that the person is gonna be made fun of or ostracized for not having it done, right, right, right and
 Those people have that opinion of a child that young are not gonna remember to check in 15 to 18 years from now to be like
 Hey
 How's the fucking going with your kids like they're not?
 Can't follow up you're never gonna get an answer to your hypothesis. You're only going off of your own personal shit
 so it's just as like yeah, but
 It's it's madness that people think, you know
 Cuz they go to this with like C sections versus natural birth and stuff like that the amount of shaming that people do to each other's
 Children and stuff like that. It's just and and it just comes what does it matter?
 Well, it just comes from people not being confident in their own life decisions
 that's what it comes down to people do not have the confidence to just live in their own decisions and they need validation and
 They need conformity from others to make them feel like oh, I did the right thing
 It's like fuck you you did the right thing for you
 That doesn't mean it's the right thing period and it's not necessarily the right thing and you gotta learn to live with decisions, man
 Also, how much happier would everyone be if they just didn't know all this shit about everybody else? Oh, god's sake
 Like I feel like no about anybody else's kids genitals to live my life. I don't know
 I think it's important that people realize I fired glowing jism out of my cock earlier this week
 I think that's an important that is important. That's important. No, no, we mean car. We have carve-outs in these rules
 That's it. You should go. Hey, I don't know if I want to talk about my kids peace through right now
 But you know what I second them out most people have some form of herpes. What form do you have and how you deal with it?
 It's true. It's true. It's universal, baby
 The old pissing disease what other aspects of my kids genitals?
 Are you gonna want to talk about later so we can just knock all these conversations out, right?
 You should be like actually the truth is I'm teaching a class on circumcision
 And I need you to give me a hundred dollars right now or I cannot talk to you about it
 Yeah, I didn't get him circumcised, but I got him a Prince Albert
 Make the choice a couple years later if he wants to keep it he's got it if he wants to get rid of it
 He's got a pull tab. You can just
 Misses since he scoop is saying that people then followed up asking about the birth
 How do I convey that that's an incredibly personal moment? I probably don't want to talk about it. You just say that
 We kept the foreskin, but we clipped his balls. So he's a
 We were asked to choose we flipped a coin
 Two-faced style like of like a Batman villain and just thought well either we're gonna give him a circumcision or no nuts
 We were we were too busy debating how we're gonna handle the fact he was born with three buttholes to figure out
 My son is essentially a boy worried about his tail my son is
 Bowling ball with a tail so you tell me where to prioritize lady
 Well the half-grown twin in his ass cheek that would like a word or two
 Psychic conjoined twin he's got a he's got a guano in his left but saddle so yeah
 You know prior I got around to the circumcision talk. Yeah, we're still we're exercising the the ass guano first
 Lastly any tips on how to raise my baby gay
 I think you just start engaging in all of these conversations about the their genitals
 People it's conversed about their genitals as you can and that's how that works. We've been doing our best. We have a gay agenda
 we're trying to raise our kids gay and
 Believe it or not these ages. They just figure it out on their own. It's the weirdest thing. Yeah life finds a way
 Gay porn around the house. We have nothing like our Christmas decorations are just like different dirty decks of cards with hot dudes
 So we just hang the cards. So yeah, yeah this tree
 They're really getting a full mouthful of it. We only serve phallic fruits and vegetables for dinner
 You know, I heard this really interesting thing
 And I may have said this before on the podcast table, but we're talking about you know, how a lot of your hardcore
 Religious types want to talk about sexuality as a choice. Yes, right and
 What this person said was for them
 It is a choice because they've had to choose to repress their natural sexuality their whole life and they don't realize that it's not a choice
 It's just interesting
 But they've had to make the conscientious choice to say no to their instincts to their basic human nature
 They have they have had to make a choice their whole life
 So they see it as everyone has to make this choice, right?
 Like I made this choice. Everyone must have made this choice somewhere along the lines like now man. It ain't a choice
 It's just the cards you dealt with those people. They're in that zone. They don't understand that
 I'm not going down to the fucking bath house. It's not a choice
 It's because I'm choosing every day to not go down to the back out bath house. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, but it's just your name
 But they don't understand that they can't see that and especially if they've been indoctrinated in a very small community that has the whole
 You know, so I thought that was a really interesting look at it
 It's like you would think it's a choice because you've had to choose to repress your own nature your entire life
 Thank you for all the laughs and creating such an awesome community Murray is still a great name for a baby
 It sure fuck yes on it because it doesn't work in Portuguese. Okay, fucking you in the face with a boob full of milk
 That's Manu. Mrs. Cincy scoop. Thanks for the information

 So look at all of us which ones are which was a formula fed which ones have circumcisions, which ones, you know
 We did die. It's like you can't tell you can't tell babies survive, right? They find them in freaking
