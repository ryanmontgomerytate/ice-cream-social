 That's Paul Mattingly in Las Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun
 Hey everybody, welcome gents, how we doing so many cute dogs
 As we are
 Airing this show we're airing from the past. I've had a birthday. I bet it went wonderfully
 I had a little vacation. I bet it went wonderfully Matt. You're on the road non-stop right now. What's going on with you?
 This I'm trying to think of what this is Aaron because I am doing this thing where I have to go to Chicago
 Yeah, do one show and then get up the next morning and fly out to
 St. Louis and then drive to a gig in Missouri two hours from the airport
 Do a corporate show that's supposed to be blood money. So this will certainly come up on the show again
 Yeah, because we a lot of drunk people go back to Chicago finish out of Chicago Magic Lounge where I'm gonna turn around
 And then go home
 For for the holidays and then after the holidays it go right back out. I got a corporate in South Bend, Indiana
 whoa
 And then I'll be heading to the jokers of magic after that, which I'm so excited about
 And while you're in South Bend, are you going to air your grievances with the Notre Dame football team and their new?
 Scheduling thing that they're gonna do with the college football playoff. That's a big part of your trip
 It's gonna be wearing Miami shorts and Alabama sweatshirt
 Just whistling, yeah
 I'm also gonna be doing a comedy club in Chicago, which I have to get more details on but I'm one of the office
 We have like one random off night
 On the tour and Mike Mills arranged for us to give it give us a shot in a comedy club
 Which I'm so excited about it's gonna be Chicago right the comedy club in Chicago
 Which means it's for people out there who are near there. It's a little more affordable than the old
 Chicago Magic Lounge, so
 Hopefully you can come out and check out that this is part of the jokers of magic tour, right? Yes
 So it'll be it'll be if me myself Mike Mills Eric Dittleman Ruben Moreland who I'm so excited
 I don't think a lot of people know Ruben, but you will know and love him. I'm so excited to do the tour with him
 Oh, very cool. He's very funny like a ball. We'll get him on the pod as well
 Are all four of you gonna do the comedy club or is it? Yes, just know. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, also fun
 So you guys you guys get to kind of write up stuff for a smaller stage then yes
 Yeah, yeah, and I could do more crowd work and things like that that I'm excited about and
 Yeah
 My secret goal is to be comedy club worthy
 This is why I'm trying to I'm trying to cajole Brian brushwood and to into maybe thinking about doing his first shows since 2010
 He's done some shows here and there but he hasn't truly
 Tored like going on done shows since 2010, which is a crime, right?
 A crime a crime people who who like that guy and I think I think it's fine
 This is here's here's my options as a as a pro, right? The jokers of magic. Hopefully this becomes a thing
 It's a lot. It's a lot of heavy lifting right now to do any kind of live theater and any kind of live touring right now
 Just for the for the people living in the middle to lower class. We are in a recession for people in the upper class
 Hopefully they want to come see tours
 That's where we're at that's where all of entertainment is at right now that is that is
 Desperately true. Yeah, this is why concerts are crazy expensive is because there's enough rich people that that they can afford that
 The sphere just put out numbers yesterday for what they what they say. They've made on the Wizard of Oz. Oh
 And it's like two hundred million dollars. Yeah, and it's I mean it's it's still yes, and they're still in the red
 But you know
 So
 You know when I try to think about like what I want to do
 It's like I can try to produce my own shows and try to do like hotel hotel the hotel model where you do like
 You team up with a fancy hotel you put like an awesome right together make it like a a wine and whatever and do that kind
 Of stuff, but that involves a production value, which means like hauling things in
 You know putting a pipe and drape and that kind of stuff and having a lighting package and an audio thing
 And I was like, no, no, no. No. I love performing comedy clubs. I
 think
 This is me. This is I'm just this is the real deal. That's what I'm talking to my friends privately. Is that yeah
 I think magic is a bigger addition of a factor to a comedy club
 Then comedy is an addition as a factor to magicians in a theater. Does that make sense?
 I I think you're absolutely right when I used to work at the Laugh Factory
 every now and then a magician would come through and
 Honestly for better or worse sometimes it would change the dynamic of the room completely
 Yeah, and so when the magician came through and they were good. It was like, holy shit. This is great
 This is built for this. Yeah, and when they came through and it was bad
 They were like, oh this is this is supposed to be funny and it's terrible and that's it and that there is there's a there's a
 There's a lot of there are cheeseball magicians out there doing cheeseball comedy
 That puns and and I win you lose lines and that kind of stuff
 That I hate so it's but that's so that's the obstacle
 but I think like in terms of like where I think I can put my effort and prove to I can do something and
 Where I think the show would be additive and where it doesn't attack my weakness, which is adding crazy
 I'm not a good tech person. So adding crazy production values, not my strength. I
 Think Amy at comedy clubs would be great. And then should it work? Should it work at all?
 Then it's easy to add Paul. It's easy to add other acts to the lineups and stuff to make it an even crazier cooler
 varietal of a show
 But but this is this is in the meantime. I'm just bound to cruise ships. Well, they figure all this out
 Yeah, yeah, and it's also a matter of just like you said before the timing of everything and where the country is financially
 God bless Mike Mills. Mike Mills is trying to make sure the jokers of magic gives it a shot
 He's trying to find smart ways for us to tour
 It is an uphill battle for all tours right now and he runs a giant touring company
 So when he says that he's talking he's talking with evidence about you know, 25 properties that he tore
 Oh, yeah, you know like Mills entertainment, you know that with a John Candy documentary was touring with
 with different guests high-end guests, you know like
 Talking about John Candy and people worked with him and Ryan Reynolds was hosting all that
 That was Mills entertainment, right? You might have even seen tik-toks and stuff with the stand by me cast
 The whole stand by me cast is reunited. Yes. They're starting that is that is that one of his
 Yeah
 So it's a brilliant idea by the way, that's it. So they're being very nice. He's locking into some good stuff there
 They've always been very innovative
 With their touring and they've and they've always been really cool stuff
 But he has data when he says it is a crazy slog right now to be trying to fill get both the seats in theaters
 He means it and so I am feeling very fortunate that he is putting me in the mix
 But that's our thing that should property and that's it
 I think that we are trying to make this viable, you know
 put some butts in seats and with the idea that we're playing a long game of
 Trying to make this a thing that happens semi regularly
 Until the economy kind of turns around for some people and we can go go go actually bring it to the people in a regular way
 Yeah
 I mean, I remember 2008 that's what I had to do, you know boats boats kept me going for
 nine months
 right basically a year I had to be away for a year to
 Keep it cooking with the same kind of financial realities that were around for entertainment. It's crazy times
 So all had to sell boats. Let's get into whether or not Mike Mills is a fool for relying on me
 So I am was finishing up show. I have a guess
 I was finishing up shows in on the princess cruise ship and I the last day of the cruise
 Not disembarkation day, but the day before here our last day at sea as we were heading towards Florida
 Okay, I locked myself out of my room. I
 Told the story on Penn Sunday school, but you know Penn just kind of laughed at me and then you know
 I figured it can get more mileage here
 and it's also I told Penn we recorded the day that it happened and
 Now we're we're a week and change later and I'm still still processing so it's worth bringing up again because I'm still oh my
 so I
 Get online, but you okay to get back into my room and
 It's a long line. So we said like you don't want anything to go wrong in the last day of the cruises because that's the day
 We're everyone. There's so much stuff going on with people getting stuff approved. Oh like a customer service line
 Yes, yeah, you're waiting in a customer service line to get a key to get back into your room
 Yes, and that's the day I was wondering why there was a line in front of your room to get back in. Oh, sorry
 No, no, thank you for you probably clarifying for the service as well. Good job and
 You're at customer service everybody's at customer service because it's the end of the cruise and everybody is I'm sure very happy with all of the
 Accommodations and things that they have paid for on the cruise and they are there to tell customer service just how happy they are, correct
 Good, and so I'm it's I'm online. It's like I was like I blew it
 I had my headphones with me because I like myself because I'm gonna go to the gym and I and I like my headphones and not
 My key so I'm listening to podcasts for like 20 minutes
 And then I finally get to like on deck before I go to my little desk
 And there's a circle of desks waiting for people or about like, you know, six different customer service people
 Okay of these desks you kind of you got to answer like a lollipop you come up you're online
 I'm picturing a circular room. Yeah. Yeah, and then I
 Take off my headphones
 Cuz I'm on deck getting ready to rock. Okay, and about six feet to my right is a guy complaining about
 His bill on spellbound, which is the name of the Magic Castle experience that I'm a part of
 He was like I did not mean to tip the magician
 So much money I meant to tip the magician several hundred dollars
 But I tipped them too many hundreds of dollars so I need I need some of that money back from the magician so I can get
 Home that's that's what the whole problem was. Yeah. Look, it's a big experience and you know, you can
 It's it's a bunch of people like coming around and so like, you know
 Who knows which part of the experience he wasn't happy with, you know, okay drinks could have been the whatever
 And then he starts saying like yeah, the magician was just terrible
 Okay
 This guy has gone to a customer service representative on a cruise ship
 To talk about a show that this customer service representative
 Certainly hasn't seen he wants his drinks taken off of his bill
 He doesn't want to pay for the drinks. He doesn't want to pay for the drinks because the entertainment was not great. That's right
 Okay
 Huh? This is a schemer and I'm on the other end of that when I go see a show and the entertainment is not great
 I am more reliant on the drinks than I usually
 Those are the shows that I do not dare complain about the drinks. Yeah, and
 I am like, well, there's two magicians. Maybe he's complaining about the other magician
 Then of course he was
 Okay, I did
 26 shows on this last run on princess. Okay, 26 shows in one week
 Over seven days. Yeah
 Wow, okay. Sometimes that's it. That's multiple shows a day. Sometimes for 30 people sometimes for two
 Okay, that's the deal
 It was a shift recently right where normally it was always for 30 some odd people
 It was always a always a that they wouldn't give me a show unless they packed the theater
 But right they change the way the experience works and how who can sign up for it and when and so you kind of have to
 Take people as they come and you end up yeah, he goes for people. So it's really weird to give a theatrical
 Magic experience to eight people. Yes
 however
 One day goes he goes. Yeah, I mean, you know he started off with like, you know
 You can't someone take a card that he found the card like who can't do that. That's what he said to the person type
 Yeah, who can't do that?
 Wait, who can't do that? He did not start going through
 Individual aspects of your show. He sure did Jacob. He sure did to the customer service rep. Yes
 Who was not asking for any details whatsoever? She was typing. She was like, hey
 Okay, what do you need? Let's see if I can do it. Yes, and so there's she was not asking for details
 So it was clear that he had like for hers this in his head, right? Oh
 He was getting out like his speech, you know
 Yeah
 And so warming up by the way, so that my opening trick that I do in the smaller environments is I have someone look at
 An envelope I put in my pocket
 They take a card they sign it. I
 say I
 Haven't put in the back of the deck. I put a side in the back of the deck to shuffle it
 And I say where's the envelope and they go in your pocket and I reach my pocket all the cards are in my pocket
 Then they literally look back to my left hand which was previously holding all the cards and it's holding an envelope
 And it said the envelope is their card and it is signed by them. Okay, anybody can do that
 Anybody can do that anyone can do that. So I was offended at his description of my opening
 You should be
 You're right to be offended by that gave him a piece of my mind. Now. Look, you know, I'm a human
 I'm a self-conscious human, you know, I'm a thing. I'm a we've established on this podcast. I'm a thin-skinned human
 I do not don't be me to Matt. He'll be up. It'll upset it
 So at first I really think to like hide
 Like I literally go like oh my god, like how embarrassing like I literally almost pull my hat like over my head
 Are you you're still in line at this point or you're a different desk, okay, right so you're in line, but he is but he's being
 Serviced by the customer service people. That's right
 Okay, and if you were across the room, I wouldn't hurt it. And if I had not locked my key of my door
 I would never known about it
 Then I'm called I have something to say about the magic show quote-unquote that I watched
 And I am
 You know
 Did you put your headphones back in surreptitiously
 No, I really had a voice go off in my head. That was like as if like I was parenting myself
 I literally go like don't you dare don't you dare and I do not interact
 No, no, but I was like don't hide like I was like, okay
 I literally got self-conscious put my head over my head and the voice went on my head was like no
 Fuck him, right?
 And so I went full like I like total split personality went full aggro
 Then I put my head back and I started standing tall and I started staring at him. Oh
 Okay, but you haven't spoken to it I haven't spoken to him and then he complains about a second trick
 Oh boy
 He's gonna go through the whole routine he's got notes I did 26 shows
 and
 25 of them every trick went amazing. Oh
 buddy and 26 shows I did six effects on his show
 One trick went wrong
 Okay, and it was my ring trick and it was like not to be too magic about it
 but I and I've performed this trick a lot and
 There was a design factor in this ring that I did not understand and therefore
 The magic effect did not work and I authentically lost their ring in a sea of rings
 Jar you have like a mason jar of rings, right?
 Yes, and I pull the ring out of a pile of rings and it's their ring on a string
 Yeah, and due to a certain design of the ring the ring did not come up with a string
 and
 Legitimately a pile of rings. Yep
 Good and as reminded of what Penn says about magic, which is when match tricks go wrong boys
 it's just a waste of everyone's time and
 And now I feel
 Less emboldened as an ogre staring him down because now he's calling you out on an actual
 He has a point very rarely
 Our magicians held to account
 Strictly by the success of their tricks and yet here I am
 Costing this company money
 For failing to do my job. Are they refunding his money? They are
 That they are they are funding his drinks there. Let's make this loud man happy enough that he will go away
 They're we're funding it before he was giving any details
 They didn't care or want the details didn't even care why he didn't like spellbound
 They just be said I did not enjoy spell and I went off
 They said okay, and then while she was trying to work it out on her computer. He just started rallying it off
 Yeah, yeah, he slowed her down telling her the things that were wrong with him
 So then I get called to my customer service desk and it's the one right next to him
 I don't get called across the room. I get called
 This makes me so happy and that's that was Penn's response that's exactly that's all pended
 Penta's laughs and said this is great
 He's right he's right that's right
 And now I'm sitting next to him and I basically I'm like now I'm like like ready to give the sup chin to him
 Cuz like yes, it's me whatever
 Now I'm dressed to go to the gym. I'm basically dressed like the way I like to be
 The whale of the chat slowly I turned
 And so I'm in like, you know t-shirt or my my my flat cap I got headphones around my neck and I'm in
 you know, you know sweatpants and
 He just doesn't recognize me straight up just looks
 Just looks at me and goes no and I'm staring at him right like a little angrily staring at him. I'm making eyes with him
 He he doesn't realize this but he's already been having a conversation with you
 he interprets my staring eyes as
 Boy, doesn't it suck to be stuck in customer service right now
 So I give him a glare and he looks at me sees my glare and puts his hand on my shoulder and says
 We'll get through this
 Oh
 Multiple levels that we'll get through this is working on my brain. I
 Like scob smacked. I am speechless. I am spinning
 This is wild that's fucking wild this is the most magical thing that happened on that cruise
 Was like I am so like
 I want to tell no one right? Like this is so embarrassing. I don't know if I could tell my wife about this
 Right
 And then I'm like and then I literally have to go to the 19th deck and take a walk. That's what I do
 I literally go like I got a harpooners run stand by
 Man the harpoons this guy looks like a jumper
 I'm like all the woulda coulda shoulda's and everything else and then all sudden going like but you did fuck up your trick
 And I was really spinning and then I was like, oh, huh, I'm gonna tell Penn and Penn
 Tell pencil this goes. Yeah, I could tell nobody I can tell, you know 20,000 people and
 And then Penn just left his ass off and then I just been processing it but I just was like
 Really? I really ran myself with a ringer for like a good couple hours and I thought I was like I
 Was really like I'm quitting magic. I'm
 People people don't this is behind the curtain right here
 This is more behind the curtain than we usually go when Matt messes up like a patreon post or something. He beats himself up
 Matt does not like making mistakes on things especially ones that he could have avoided
 It's so the fact that this guy is being an asshole and you're like in your mind. You're like, oh this fucking jerk
 He's being a he's being a jerk and he's being a jerk about my thing and that sucks and man
 This guy's really being a jerk shit. He said something that's correct. I I did mess that up
 And he is just he is correct. I don't have a firm fuck that guy
 I'm great at telling someone else fuck that guy, right?
 You're like this guy did this to me. I'm great at like getting in my friends faces and be like hey fuck that guy
 You know and really getting the person to like really shed it, you know, yeah, it does not work on me. I cannot do it
 Can't do it. I'm the child of a public defender. I literally like, you know, it's like oh my god that murder my brain goes
 Well, it came from somewhere. What was his childhood? Like who did what he do? You know, like I this is what I grew up
 Seeing the three-dimensionality of life's horrors through the New Jersey criminal justice system
 I always try to give someone credit even if they're being full dickheads to me, right?
 Oh, if I can take a part of it as blame, I will shovel that blame onto my own shoulders
 Speaking of taking blame. I don't think we discussed how did the rest of the ring trick go after the mechanism didn't work?
 Great question
 What is the solution there I literally have to go in front of the audience and peel through all the rings to
 And find it and return it to them
 oh
 So you don't just like take the table off stage and hand it to a stage hand like with the couple and be like
 Help these people find their ring. I now yeah, I have no stage hands on spellbound on my regular
 If I was on the main stage of her cruise ship I could do exactly what you just said
 But yeah, it's spelled like here's the couple whose ring I just lost please find the ring for them and send them back to their
 See, man, I really only have one question Matt. Yes. I really have one question
 After you have to scatter the rings out and go through them bit by bit
 Yeah
 And slowly but surely disseminate the junk rings and find the one when you do finally find it
 Do you at least give a tada?
 Did you do a flourish when you found?
 Don't do that Paul I don't do that
 I'm gonna say missed opportunity missed opportunity. I
 It's funny. I I think it's cuz I you know came up through Penn and Teller Penn and Teller don't have
 Women we're relaunching the show and we were working with Jeff McBride and Jeff McBride was you know is a famous magician his own
 Right a huge huge magician runs a magic school here in Las Vegas the most famous one of the most famous magic schools in the world
 Jacob no Paul rather
 This I don't think I could be more accurate this metaphor even though this will go over most of the audience's head
 He is the Sharna Halpern of magic
 Yeah, yeah, Jeff is yes Jeff McBride is yeah one-on-one ratio Sharna Halpern ran Improv Olympic and all the things that okay bitch
 About Sharna about people bitch about Jeff about and all the power that trying to had Jeff has
 great
 but he he they he was hired as a consultant to help relaunch the show post-pandemic and I was in the room with him and
 At one point they were doing it going over a trick and
 Jeff McBride goes well, what's your out on that and this is an out is like magicians basically like what's your thing?
 If you miss it you go back and you get it later. Uh-huh. What's up that fucks up? What's your what you're out?
 Yeah, and they both turned to Jeff and go like we don't have outs
 And he goes what do you mean you don't you don't have it out for this he goes no we don't have outs we don't use outs
 Because you live outside any tricks and they go no
 It works or it doesn't they go. What do you think? Oh, we just move along
 Right and this made Jeff laughs like so hard
 He's like, what do you think you don't have outs and I was laughing I go, you know, it's funny Jeff
 I haven't worked with them there for years. They don't
 And a teller don't yeah use outs
 They just go like that didn't work and they go what that's next next and so
 I
 Comedically point out how much authentic sweat was piling up on my forehead as I
 Went through the rings in a jar until I found their ring and then said I could try to do something magical
 Here to try to make this an out and make this not a mistake
 But I think just funny to let you guys know that I made a mistake and we're moving on and I got a big laugh
 And then I finished the show strong with two more effects. And so I thought I had recovered the show as a whole
 Beautifully well, and I think was proved 95% of your audience did think that oh
 That's because you have not heard about the people that were in line behind that the rest of the crowd was in line behind Matt
 You can they also didn't recognize him, but they had things to say. No, you can't make all everybody happy
 It's just what it is. Oh man. No time. It was on the same ship
 We were doing I did end up doing a show for two people and it was so awkward
 So the next group that came oh my show for two people. I said listen, you're doing shows at the you're doing tricks at the bar
 I go let me just switch off with you at the bar. We'll just do all of our tricks. Oh, yeah
 They go great
 And so we he and I
 entertained two people and two people left over at the bar going back and forth doing tricks and end up getting real kind of energy in
 There's really fun. And I love all sudden. I was like man. I love doing magic behind the bar. This is really fun
 Yeah, those people complained they didn't get the theatrical experience and got money for fuckers
 They got the intimate special one-of-a-kind thing and they're like I didn't like that
 It's just cuz they can this cruise ships. I'm gonna say this is cruise ship. This is this is that is that is these are the people
 That are on the cruise ship already that I like that's the thing is you you are just this is gonna sound like I'm being mean
 To you, but I'm not
 This is the thing where you are just in their mind one of the things that's like a box that they can tick
 They're like, yep. I think I get my money back on that one. I'm pretty sure I can get my money back on this like
 Oh, I got I ate at this restaurant. It's a little more than eating the buffet, but you know, the steak was overcooked
 So I'm gonna go ahead and get my money back on that man
 I never had to go through hearing or seeing any kind of critique on my
 Stuff it shows when we were doing well
 Again so again because I'm part of this boutique experience right through the Magic Castle. It's not a regular thing
 So on a regular ship, I am ushered on through the entertainment, you know, I'm greeted by the you know, the the the entertainment director
 I'm handled with my you know tech and all the run-throughs and all this other stuff and I will never hear anything on those ships
 So the regular ships that I do this is a premium
 Experience. Yes. It's the only thing people can pay for an additional cost. Yes, and therefore they cop people who that makes a fucking difference
 They you know that kind of stuff. Oh sure. Yeah, and so you deal with all kinds of and oh
 I didn't even think about you still get casino comps on the ocean. Yes, you can't get away from get the casino comps and
 Once my first day once I'm ushered onto the ship
 that's the last time I see an entertainment director until the end of the ship from then on I am under the
 jurisdiction of the restaurant manager and catering Oh
 Yes, and those people are not an entertainment and so they know they tell you things very plainly the way no entertainment director ever would
 So that's how I found out about the theater experience thing
 No
 And I like an entertainment director an agent nobody else nobody in the entertainment world is telling you about that at all
 No, and even what time I end up not not without a lot of sugar
 I did know not doing one of my five shows when I supposed to because I was told
 By someone else that it was not gonna be for like another half hour
 So I went okay
 I went I left the theater and I got yelled at yell that like I was
 Like a like a bartender like like working for them
 Yeah, and it was like looking at them like what I'm like, I why are you you cannot?
 Like why are you yelling at me? And right I?
 Was like I said I said I said just as you know, I wait till it calm down. I gave it a beat
 I did my show I went back to them and I said just so you know, I never leave
 The room unless it's set for a show. So the moment you want to show you can have it
 I said all I've done this entire week is say yes
 I've never said no to a single thing. So you tell me the shows are I'm doing six shows tonight
 I'm doing four shows tonight. I'm doing two shows. I'm doing a show for two people
 I'm doing a show for 30 people all I have said the entire time was yes
 So please don't treat me like I'm some guy sneaking off to like slack and right
 Yeah, that's not what I'm doing
 I said so you can just shoot me a text saying need you now and you will have a show that starts in a minute
 And I was like, that's all you need to know
 And it's just like you can't
 Basically what I couldn't say was like you can't yell at a performer and expect them to be very good at this
 right
 You're lucky you're talking to someone who has an experienced bartender and experienced catering waiter and experienced mater day
 Yeah, you've been in that you've been in that world long enough to know what it is. But boy, that's what I was
 By the way, it's somebody who's gone through enough therapy to not like scream back at her
 She's yelling at you in the first place. Yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Lindsay Bashir is right. I said I was a waiter and I cried
 Tears from the eyes, but I was like and this is all you know, and this is it's it's just a strange thing
 It's a strange gig that I looked into it's a weird bit
 and the strange bit is is it pays slightly better than the
 Than if I was a main stage performer performing for all thousand people at the same time in the theater, right doing two shows in a cruise
 What I'm doing because I'm working seven nights a week and doing three or four sets a night actually pays better
 So even though this is shittier and it's less glorious and I don't feel like an entertainer as much as I feel like a high-end
 bartender waiter
 Okay, it's still worth it to do it for my family to do to do the experience. Yeah, man
 I mean at least you feel like a high-end bartender. It's true. I'm gonna talk to you could could be a low-end bartender
 I'll tell you who loves a good low-end bartender and by that I mean bartending on their ends and that's the following sponsor
 Today's show is brought to you by
 Sorry, I brought the jokers of magic dates and then where did it go? Oh, here we go
 Today shows brought to you by Brian brushwood and Justin Robert Young's greatest hits volume two
 That's right. Today's show is brought to you by Brian brushwood and Justin Robert Young's greatest hits album volume two
 Hey everybody, it's Brian. Hey, I'm here with the
 scams cool
 Look, I know I know what you want. I know what you want to trick your friends. You want to trick your neighbors?
 You want to trick your kids? Well, you can't
 I'm about to show you a secret. This is a deep dark secret
 Picture it
 1958 a
 Young American sailor just got done with a tour of near Cambodia
 He decides that he's gonna go for a swim. Yeah
 so he puts on some fins a
 snorkel mask and dives
 He dives just outside of one of the Cambodian islands as deep as he can go with a single breath
 While he's down there in the ocean depths. He comes upon
 a mollusk
 inside this mollusk he later discovers a pearl a
 Perfect pearl or what he assumes to be a perfect pearl
 So he takes that pearl out of the mollusk and
 Thinks on it. He's looking at this beautiful gem that was created inside the gut of this squiggly little animal that lives
 inside of a collapsed shell
 He thinks to himself. I bet if I made a bunch of these I
 Could really make a business
 Sure enough
 He looks into the deed for that area of beach and it just happens to be for sale
 And the price of that beach happens to be almost exactly
 His four months furlough salary that he was receiving from a GI bill
 So he decides to take a risk he buys that small piece of beach off of Cambodia
 and he starts seeding all of these
 mollusks all around this seabed and
 creating pearls and
 He turns this into a business
 It takes a couple of months for the pearls to be created
 He brings them up
 takes the pearl
 Puts many of them right back into the water. They keep breeding
 He's making conditions down there that are very affable to how they live. He feeds these mollusks
 He's got a real farm going
 It's incredible
 By 1963 he has an empire built on this small island
 He's the king. He's ruling this place with his trade in pearls
 He can't believe his luck. How lucky can you get the pearl magnate of?
 South Cambodia this guy he's got everything he needs
 But then he finds one of these mollusks
 Has left its normal shell and gone into a very fancy spiral one
 He crafts this spiral shell
 and he looks inside and
 He pulls out the mollusks that he's seeded and sure enough
 There's a pearl in there more perfect than any other pearl
 He keeps this shell and he keeps reseeding it over and over again
 and
 that shell
 Becomes the new holy grail for his enterprise
 he can't get better pearls than what he finds in this shell and
 that's because
 this man
 after six years of farming pearls has found
 the world's
 greatest conk
 I am so mad for so many reasons
 I
 Don't care what you do
 Nick in the chat says I'm mad at myself for invested. I wasn't this I honestly didn't even know where it was going for a
 Long time. Oh you really I thought I was gonna make a pearl necklace joke for a minute and then I finally went
 Oh, yeah world's greatest. No world's greatest conk. Yeah
 That's funny Matt and I both knew you're going there before you did yeah
 That was a true cliff-diver
 Thank You Leon
 Constant fools because we're stupid cunks fools because we're human
 By the way, they just did a banger of a new episode on the Ponzi scheme. Oh
 Yeah, I've got to listen. Oh and world's greatest. I'm saving it. Yeah. Oh good. Yeah, he's only got the first episode up, right?
 I mean, I think it's a one. I believe it's just a one-off. Oh, it's just a one-off. Okay, gotcha
 Yeah. Yeah. Oh good. I've got a I've got plane flights this week
 I need some good shows
 But yeah
 I'm sorry Paul has distracted us from everything that we might have been thinking about
 Being a suffering cruise ship
 But now all I can think about is world's greatest cock when I speak with such glowing enthusiasm for my upcoming jokers of magic gigs you now
 You really understand why?
 Really just I'm so excited to do real shows for real people and real environment away from that that structure. Yeah, that's a hard structure
 cruise ships are
 They can be a nightmare. It's
 Their own this is their own world. There's just a strange that's there on the world. Yeah, I don't I don't begrudge it
 I don't I think I think it keeps a lot of people employed in a lot of levels
 A lot of brother I did for me. Yeah, I know I had a conversation this week with an old friend of mine
 who works for Royal Caribbean and and that's what he was saying he was because he's kind of the
 When new cast members and new entertainers are coming in
 he's the one that's dealing with a lot of these these new people and
 He's like yeah
 The first two three weeks is just me telling them to trust me that it's all gonna work out this way
 It's all a dumb system that they don't understand yet, but eventually they'll understand the dumb system and it'll be fine
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and yeah, it's just like it's this whole different thing. That's not like anything else in especially not an entertainment
 Yeah, it's it's you know
 and so actually when I'm talking about with with Penn is that like
 For other things it makes a lot of sense, but in in entertainment you already already you already speak a currency of immediate gratification, right?
 You showed up in the theater you laugh you applaud you leave with a smile on your face or
 Or those things don't happen and you very much understand that those things didn't happen and you need to make adjustment, right?
 You need to figure things out
 So you don't need this additional
 Threat of a future feedback loop that's going to hurt your reputation down the line
 As you talk from one person to another I don't know
 I mean you thought the rest of the show went really well is what you said
 I mean, it sounds like you might have needed this extra feedback. I don't know
 Maybe he just didn't think you look you looked ashamed of yourself enough
 By the end of the show
 Jessica Jane Peterson has been doing the the Lord's work. She's trying to get me on booked on Disney cruises, right?
 that's that's her goal is to get me booked on Disney and
 By we have the same agent and
 So an opportunity came up at at Disney
 He knew that there was a goal and he fired off my stuff to Disney and he fired off my usual stuff
 Just sent them what he sends everyone. Yeah is not what you want to do to sell stuff to Disney Disney now
 and so
 And so I got
 Rejected I got I got no he does not seem like he is he is gonna be a good fit on the ship
 What's that opening monologue you do about all of your experiences at Disney parks that I think really might have turned him off?
 That one experience, oh you guys like Disney do you
 This is this is way before Splash Mountain this is more like Trash Mountain
 And so
 You know like I I was like they said the feedback and I was like, oh well if you set them my usual tape
 Then yeah, I agree with I agree
 You had a you had a different thing ready to go I don't know I did a cleaner show
 With children in the theater
 At Dickens in Delaware that I had an hour-long tape of that. It wasn't 45, but it was certainly more now
 I still did my straightest jacket escape, which is which is one of their notes of like you could not cannot do that
 I'm right. Okay. Well then fuck them
 You don't want to work for them. Anyway
 But if you did
 My suggestion going forward Matt would that would be that you adopt a fursona. Ah
 I would say I heard fursona and the answer is yes
 Sona I see Jessica Jane, you know, and she's able to very quickly just
 slide into
 Disney Princess mode
 You need to go full sully and you need a full furry outfit
 Head to toe listening go on and and that needs to be the character that you create for these various
 Particular child-friendly Disney s gigs. You need a persona magic routine. Why would Matt dressing up as a commercial airline pilot?
 Excite these children
 No, why would they care about that at all monsters already sullys that I landed a plane at a river
 Yeah, yeah. I know but a love to do magic as sully. I would love to do it
 I would do that so fast as sully that the be really funny to do it as the airline pilot
 Yeah, it would be the hero of the Hudson. Yeah
 The magic of sully sullenberger. I go to do a levitation and a bird strike hits
 This child will be in the Hudson and I was gonna land this I'm gonna land this
 Routine in the Hudson, but yeah, I think you could do you could do a full
 You know and you could talk with you could talk with Harry the Gorilla Gition because he's got experience with that
 He's basically taking on a fauna for magic. So, you know, I
 Didn't watch a recent
 Paul I don't know if you've been keeping up with fool us
 But I watched a recent fool us episode and there was a fella on there that I laughed really hard at his routine
 Before I realized what was happening
 He does like like film work and stuff and he came out and did a very interesting avant-garde
 Magical routine was this the body had a man? Yes. Yes boy that routine
 I was sitting there looking at it going like how the fuck does this guy travel a buffalo head and then I realized that he
 Just doesn't this was a one-off thing
 That was the strangest thing we had ever done unfool us. Yep, and
 When it was over, we had no better explanation
 Penn and teller didn't know like how to even bust what they were watching, right?
 But I don't think you fooled us
 Also, I don't know what you just did
 Cool. There's some interactive like film to life elements, which I guess qualify as illusion
 there was there was this whole thing where part of it relied on Brooke going in and out of
 The film. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She was a character
 Yes, and they didn't have anything the outfit that she needed to go in and out to make it really believable and
 Seamless or at least a little more seamless
 It was close, but I we ended up doing a ball was there
 We end up doing like heavy lifting by we I mean the production team the production team did a lot of work to get that
 Thing to get to get that to where it was
 They ran through it at least for at least three times so there's a lot and and then the ending I like four times
 There's everyone in the audience feel like they're just tripping balls. Yeah. No, that was just it. Everybody was like what the fuck is going on
 I mean, I just watched it on TV and I was still tripping but nobody hated it
 It was it was interesting enough that everybody was still polite and chill with it
 So, you know, that's what the guy after Matt and line said to his customer service representative about Matt show. Mm-hmm
 I hated it. Hey, everybody's polite enough
 Head was interesting. I wish I was wearing a big buffalo head while I was sitting in customer service
 This is what I'm telling you Matt you get you need a second fursona
 So that when things go south on the ship, you can just put on a mask and fuck all these fools
 Yeah, I don't know. I'm just sully I
 Had to come up with a unique character
 Sully Sullenberger the
 Magic performing airplane pilot is pretty good character kind of ridiculous actually
 Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, so I'll try to try the Sullenberger thing
 I did I did think of what we talked about moving the baseball cards to Marvel characters, which I think that would work
 all right, right and
 You know
 JJ, of course, you're still like no we can figure it out
 We just have to you know, whatever and I'm just like I don't know if this is worth chasing
 Well, did you just hear yesterday's big announcement from them know how they're doubling down with AI
 Who I don't even know what them you're talking about Disney, okay, it's really it's fucking weird
 Because they had a lawsuit pending
 Against a lot of these AI companies
 Where they were they were winning in court a lot of times about misuse of their and misappropriation of their characters
 And they have turned on a fucking dime and not only have they decided to allow these companies full access to their characters
 But they are making investments in the millions and billions of dollars into said companies
 So yeah, I mean this somebody got in somebody's bossy bossy just put one up in the chat here
 It says Disney's got about a one billion dollar investment with a B with open AI
 It's bring hundreds of Disney characters to its generative AI platforms, right?
 So that is a that is a shift that is a policy shift over a huge shift a huge shift and it's not it doesn't bode
 Well, but it's also just one more thing where we're just propping up this bullshit that doesn't do anything
 Except let Sully fuck Mike Wazowski in the ass
 You know like oh great
 Yeah
 Yeah, how how fun I get to watch Cinderella and essentially like Pixar has always had like a
 Not even a hand in relationship with Disney, you know
 Yeah, and Pixar just announced or do they decide to go the other way and they went back to doing a hand-drawn animation
 The next the next the next movie coming out Sandra on and I think they're right to do it
 like I
 Here's here's the thing. Is that like?
 In terms of like not trying to be doom and goomba AI, but also not liking some of the things I'm seeing I came up with
 a metaphor
 For myself were like I consider it like cooking
 Okay, like okay figured out how to cook everything by machine and then our lives we see things that are by
 Cooked by machine and we don't pay a lot for it and we don't care that much about it, right?
 So we get fast food burgers from from you know
 There's places and then it has not stopped us from craving better burgers
 And then we've only turned around and respected people who are doing things more bespoke to make food taste good
 So we we regularly pay people to do the expert things that at a level that we just simply don't want for machines
 Right and bespoke nachos are the superior nachos way to kick with torpedo my point Jacob
 No, no, but I mean this is like I think like yes great all these people are gonna be allowed to make all of their own
 Disney movies and all that's gonna make us do is not give a shit or want to pay for those things
 I'm not pay good money for those things
 We might still consume it like we do all consume fast food
 But we won't sit around raving about how we need to pay good money for this shit. It's clearly going to become
 overall a devaluation of all of it, but I don't they're not I don't think they see that yet and I don't know I
 Don't know that matters. So there's also a part of me and this is real
 There's a part of me that's thinking like maybe it needs to be devalued a little bit
 Absolutely. Well, the whole thing is just strange. Anyway, it has gotten away from itself, but
 Yeah, the descendant of Walt Disney is always speaking up at shareholders meetings
 Talking about how they'd be more generous and how they're portraying all these other things. It's it's a weird time
 Yeah
 Because all these things only in only in regards to Disney though. Everything else is going smoothly
 But for Disney, it's an odd time in history right now, but that was a very freaky turnabout
 from a huge creative company and I think you're okay for not
 Being accepted by a company whose standards are clearly in limbo right now
 Yeah, I mean look I have you know over the years where I almost got a job at ESPN and ESPN was bought by Disney or I?
 my you know, my kids go to Disneyland for free because my
 Mother-in-law's a retired employee
 You know, don't get me wrong. I do a lot of back-and-forth at this about my relationship to the Disney as a company and investment
 I mean I have we all do
 My Toy Story stuff down there and you know, yeah
 Yeah, I mean I loved Aladdin and Little Mermaid and Lion King. Although that was very formative stuff
 Oh, we used to go to Disneyland Park, but we'd go there like 10 11 12 times a year easily
 We'd just pop over there and just do a day and it's incredible
 Yeah, you know like that that experience in those parks is incredible, right? It's expensive and incredible
 That's the thing is now it's now it's fucking expensive
 Expensive now. It's like holy shit. What are you guys doing prohibitive? Yeah, we go, you know for for free and it's expensive
 Yeah, like like just just they make you add on all the stuff that pay for all the extra extra stuff
 You don't just want like dinner. Yeah, it's like get a good dinner
 Yeah
 But I'm saying like this is this this is what this is what's gonna happen with AI is it's just gonna make it's just gonna make
 The the waters muddier and it's gonna make real creators stand out and because it's gonna be a relief
 More than just it's difficult
 I'm sure you guys are doing the same thing like like scrolling on YouTube or on any social media thing on Instagram or whatever
 Oh, it's so crazy just in this last couple of weeks there every every videos like it seems like the majority of the videos that
 Are coming through now are AI something. Yeah, and and if we weren't
 media savvy
 We won't even be questioning it. Well, like I saw one the other day that was you know, some some left-leaning
 Political organization put out a photo of Trump with the with the wind blowing his hair in a certain way
 That made it look like he was completely bald and had a big comb over now
 Donald Trump has famously has hair that looks like cotton candy made of piss
 I'm not defending Donald Trump's hair, but I looked at this picture for about half a second was like this is photoshopped
 Somebody is somebody's photoshopped this picture to make him to make him look worse than he does
 Also, why waste your fucking time making Donald Trump look worse than he actually looks you don't need to it's but like
 What are you doing? And I see that I go instantly we go like well, that's fake
 moving on but not everything the scary thing is like you've got like videos of
 People falling over and dropping shit and then you go. Oh, okay
 They've got an extra arm or or oh that that little piece came out of nowhere
 I but it won't be long before you can't discern
 No, and that's the dangerous thing is that they're gonna use it as a propaganda tool
 That's why they're pushing it so hard is to try and get it to better itself to the point where you can't discern
 truth from fiction and then and then
 like
 I've seen I've seen good damn bands on this. So people are selling online
 You can do the print model of a ring that you put it on your hand and it's an extra finger, right? Oh
 It's great. You make sure you wear that if you're going to protest or if you're gonna be in any kind of compromising situation
 Or just wear it day to day and any photos taken of you
 You can then point to that and go like it's clear. It's clearly AI
 There's an extra business right digit. Oh
 I love using analog technology to defeat the the AI technology
 But that's also like if you're a murderer, you're gonna start wearing extra fingers
 Listen murderers have been ahead of technologies curve for many years. I guess you're right, but jeez, it's scary
 Who else has been ahead of murderers for a long time, maybe not long enough. We'll see that's the following sponsor
