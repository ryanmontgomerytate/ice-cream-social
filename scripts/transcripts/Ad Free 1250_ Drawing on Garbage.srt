1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you are here. I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. It's a new month, I don't have a new list yet,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 but we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver by name before this episode starts.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Not this episode, a later episode of this show. You know what I mean.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, PreachingFun.com, that's where you can go.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Go sign up, be an ice cream truck driver, deliver this frickin' ice cream straight to people's frickin' ear holes,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 and who knows, the life you save may be your own.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Ah, my voice just cracked there a little bit and I realized that I set my water down in a different room

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 and forgot to bring it in here, so I've got that going for me.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Great, let's go.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We have this whole vamp part where we stay with whatever we want to go with your water.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 That's true. That's true, I could have gone right now.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I could be back by now with warm, high drink, but alas.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Sitting at sea, it's Matt Donnelly.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's Paul Mattingly.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 In Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We're PreachingFun.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're PreachingFun.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 We are.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Hey everybody.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 What's up, everyone?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 We have a guest in Zoom today.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Yes.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 As I almost said in churn, we have a guest in Zoom.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I love the new studio. It feels just like home to me.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Isn't it nice? We just wanted to really make you feel right at home.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Celestia, how are you?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I'm doing good. I've recovered from ScoopFest. I hope everybody else has too.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Oh, that makes one of us.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Paul, how are you? You were hurting yesterday, right?

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I have had a week, gentlemen.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's happening.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I was tired from ScoopFest. Got in Monday early.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Had a day to recuperate. Did laundry and such shit.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I say a day to recuperate. It was hardly a day to recuperate.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Tuesday night, I'm teaching my free improv class.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Wednesday morning, 4 a.m., I'm at Target.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So small window of sleep there.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Right.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I get home on Wednesday.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I do a Zoom meeting about a show on Friday, our podcast.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And then I hit the hay because I'm already sleep deprived.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I work on Thursday. I'm still very sleep deprived.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Get up on Thursday. Thursday is lawn mowing day.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Come back home, take a two hour nap, mow the lawn.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Is every Thursday lawn mowing day?

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Then crash out again. This Thursday was.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 OK, OK.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 It's also pick up poop and trash day.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 So those were my big things for Thursday.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It's good to have a list.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 After I did my 4 a.m. work till 10.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Then Friday, finally, this is going to be the start of recuperation time.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I'm going to go to work on Friday in the morning and then Friday.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Well, Friday is going to be busy.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 But Friday we were going to go to the optometrist.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Me and Ann for our annual.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And then we were going to hang out all day, drive around, have some snacks.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And then because she was off off, which meant she couldn't get pulled in,

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 which is what usually happens when we make plans.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And then I was going to go and do a show at Skit with the teachers in the evening.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And then I'd be free and done.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And then today it was going to just be.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Off, I was going to sleep in, catch up on sleep, maybe go to the comic book store, whatever.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Well, and yet when yet.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So we go for our annual optometrist visit and everything's going smooth, everything's fine.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And then the optometrist says, you need to go to the emergency optical place.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I'm like, what the fuck?

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So apparently I have hemorrhaging happening in my left eye and only my left eye.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 There's an emergency optical place.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Yeah, there is. Yep.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Pittsburgh health care is way above what you got in Vegas.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 That's for sure.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And it's just optical only optical only.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Yep. Wow. Yeah, I've never heard of such.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I know it was pretty wild.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 So but here's the well, I'll get to it.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But so I'm like, OK, shit anyway, it's not both eyes.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So that kind of negates diabetic stuff, which I've never had.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I don't have hypertension.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 My blood pressure is not perfect, but it's not terrible.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Right. So, you know, that's not it.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's not bleed out of your eyes bad.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's not bleed out of my eyes bad.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 My optic nerve is unaffected.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 My coronial area is not affected.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I haven't had any vision problems.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I wouldn't have known anything if I hadn't gone in for my annual.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Right. Yeah.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 So you can see you couldn't like in the mirror, could you see blood or anything?

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 No, no, no.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 The only thing that's happening are literal pin, pin prick points of blood in my eyeball at the ends of veins.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 You heard him at the ends of veins that you can't you can't see with the naked eye.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 You can only see it with the with the optics of a microscope looking in my eyeball.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Right. OK. Like these things are pin sized splotches of blood.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's not my my eye.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Aqueous humorous full blood or anything.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 How did you know that I was little hemorrhage, little tiny hemorrhages, little tiny hemorrhages.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 We go to the fucking optical specialist and we get some more pictures done.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And the nurse there is like, I don't know what this is.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm not an expert. I don't know what this is.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I mean, you're not an expert.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I mean, you are an expert. I don't know what this is.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So they don't know what it is.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And then it would be really terrible if you went to a doctor and they explained to you how they're not an expert.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Right. Well, then the doctor comes in, the actual expert doctor.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 This is my first day, buddy. Really?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Sorry, I don't know what this is.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And I've been in this fucking thing. I read a whole book and this was not in it.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I've had my eyeballs dilate over here.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Well, it's because it's not in tandem that's throwing them. Right. Gotcha.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And I think it's probably a vascular thing. Like something's just not.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Did you tell them about your fight club?

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Right. That was the thing.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I don't know. Did I experience head trauma? That's the other thing.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Like, that's the other thing they asked me about head trauma.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I'm like, did I experience head trauma?

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Well, that's it. Good head trauma. You're not going to remember, right?

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Did you tell them that someone told you that you had dust mites in your eyelids and you took a vacuum cleaner to one of your eyes?

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I told them that. They said, no, that shouldn't affect anything.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But I did. I had, you know, I had a lot of travel. I had a lot of work, extra stuff, extra stress.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 You know, we're, we're busy. Sure. Sure. I've been doing shows.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I've been, I've been busy as fuck. One-legged man and asking contest. You heard my week when it got back.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I got the scoops. He thinks it was your, your character changes during Pollywood Squares.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It's possible. Too much pressure on your, on your eyeball.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Any of it's possible. So the other thing is.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 What made this an emergency? I mean, was there, what would happen if it was not treated?

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Because I don't know. Only one real podcaster in the zoom right now and it's Celestia Ward.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Yeah. Because the, the optometrist believed that it could be a, a vascular issue.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Oh, Chris, thanks for putting us on with soccer, buddy.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Poor Chris. I hope his back is feeling better. So. Oh, no, we're running into medical elements left and right.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 He's old. So I, she said it could have been a vascular issue.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So she was worried it could be something indicative of, you know, stroke or whatever.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 She didn't say that exactly, but that's kind of, you know, it could be something he might be right in the chat.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 She says you got fucked in the face too much at scoop. I mean, that's true.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Well, here's the thing. Some evil villain meant to put tiny nanite robots into your bloodstream,

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 but it was supposed to be for like the governor, but somehow it could be, it could be the Borg.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 They had identical luggages at the airport and like, and they thought they were going to get nanites into the governor's.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Russian spies. Who the fuck knows?

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And Paul does have nice luggage. So I mean, it could be, yeah.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 You know, the Irish band did a lot of Johnny Cash songs. Did they in fact damn your eyes?

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Oh, they have. Oh, good question. Good question.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But I can see through this burning ring of fire, so I don't know. It doesn't hurt. There's no symptoms.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 That's the thing. So there's no symptoms. So I'm in the stirrup after having my eyes redialated, rejiggered.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Fucked with forever. Wait, the stirrup? Yeah. Your chin stirrup.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Yeah. You put your head in the chin stirrup and you press your face against thing and they're looking into a microscope.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Oh, you don't know what it's like to be in stirrup, said the doctor.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Okay. Not that kind of stirrup. Thank you. That's what I was going. It's a chin stirrup. It's not a new fetish.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 A chin rest? New fetish unlocked. Chin rest, chin stirrup. I don't know.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I only want to be in stirrups now at the eye doctor. That would have been some shit. Put me in the stirrups doc.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It might come to that. So he's looking at me and he's asking me all these questions.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Do you have all these, you know, health things? No, no, no, no. All this other stuff. You vape? No.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Do you use, what was the wording he said? Oh, he said do you use IV drugs? And I go, IV drugs?

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Ann was in the room with me. She starts laughing. She's like, no, no, he doesn't do any kind of.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 But I mean, it was just such a foreign concept to me. I'm like, IV, what do you mean IV drugs?

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Am I getting a slow drip of morphine somewhere? No.

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Do you vape? Do you use TikTok? Have you lost all hope for owning property or retiring?

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 All right, you can knock Millennial off. He doesn't have Millennial eye.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I didn't know what the fuck was going on. So anyway, I was like, no, no, no, no, no to all of it.

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And they're basically stumped. So they set up a battery of tests. So I went and got blood work today.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 So I'm getting blood work today, which they're checking for like syphilis, AIDS, all this other shit.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I'm like, God damn it. I had to put in my eye. I had to put in my social security for an AIDS check.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I don't know. Anyway, so we're going through all these tests. It's a fucking mess. I don't know what they don't know.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 They don't know. That's the thing. I get to be. This is just yesterday. Medical oddity.

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 This was yesterday. And then today was the text we get from Paul yesterday is, oh, it's a good thing.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 We didn't record today because we're recording a day late this week. A good thing we didn't record today because apparently my eye is hemorrhaging.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Yeah, I wouldn't have been able to record anyway because I was busy with medical shit all day.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But I was supposed to go and perform at seven thirty over at skit with the teachers and I did it and was kind enough to tag along with me still.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 We were already out there in the city. So we went ahead and performed. I didn't stay for the jam, but I performed with the poor you drove with one eye.

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 She drove with the other. You guys drove with both eyes. But let me tell you, every fucking taillight was a spectacle.

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Oh, yeah. Christmas lights. My eyes were still fully dilated. Even I had shades on and it was still really crazy.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And I was looking my eyes were like saucers. So I did that. I felt, you know, I felt pretty good about making that responsibility and coming through on that.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 How was your show? Yeah. And so then we looked fine to pull. We had a show. So let's get my lights went off. Yeah.

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Yeah, there was lights. They did both things. There were games played. So anyway, I think there were people I couldn't say there were there were like 18 or 20.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 So that's what you were told. You couldn't see. Yeah. Yeah. I will say this.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I love improvising with Matt Donnelly. Yeah, I really love it.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's it's a special, wonderful thing that I have in my life. And there's really no substitute.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So I will say also, yeah, then today likes it today had to go get up early. So I didn't get to sleep in again.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I'm like, I got to work tomorrow. They said no restrictions on anything, but I still feel kind of weird. I don't know, but it's all good.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Again, no pain, no, no. I'm not seeing things different. I don't know what the fuck is going on.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's just frustrating as hell because it is a medical mystery.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 But you're a day history, even though I had to get up early and get my blood drawn and I would just and has been my rock beside me the whole time.

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Really incredible. She's the sweetest thing ever. She's terribly, terribly worried for me.

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 She doesn't talk like that at all. She's way more worried than I am. I'm more angry than worried.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I don't sound like this when I talk. I don't sound like this when I sing.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I got to follow up on Tuesday. But aside from my eye hemorrhaging and having to get blood drawn today, today might just be my perfect day.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It might be my perfect day. So other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play? We get the blood drawn.

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I love the direction. The costumes were immaculate and is feeling, you know, feeling the security at the booth could have been better.

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 She's feeling very sorry for me. And she's proud of how brave I've been through all this.

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And so we go right after the eye thing, right? Right after the blood draw.

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 We go. We're out on McKnight Road, which is all the stores and fancy malls and stuff like that.

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 It's the busiest one of the busiest streets out there.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Everybody calls it McKnight Mayor Road because people drive crazy. It's big city. Anyway, so we're driving along.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And I'm thinking to myself, the places I've been on McKnight Road, we don't go out very much to McKnight.

198
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And I was like, oh, did special boy get a special day?

199
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Did I ever get a special day? I'm like, oh, and can we go to the ice cream?

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Can we go to the exchange, which is a Zia Records type place, right? Oh, nice.

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Nice. I love Zia Records where it's all like a good a good record.

202
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Used music, used video games, used toys. I'm in hog heaven. I go and I see and I've been I've been itching to get a new rock band guitar because I that's one of the things I let go during my move.

203
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I foolishly let go of all my plastic instruments and you can't get one for all of the video game rock band under 100 bucks.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And I need one for my 360 because it's got to be so it's got to be old. It's got to be retro. And when you start getting into that old 360 models, a lot of people didn't treat them great.

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So I don't I didn't want to risk buying one online because then I'm out like 130, 150 bucks and I don't even know if it's going to be covered in rat feces.

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So which is which is one of the songs you have to play on rock band rat feces.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Really as soon as I walked in the door I'm thinking you know what I should go and look about a rock band guitar because that's really the only thing video game related I need right now.

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Rat feces rat feces. So I look up and they've got a box a full box of the whole kit and caboodle.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Oh the kit and the caboodle. 250 bucks. I'm like ah shit for everything but I don't really want the drums anymore don't need the microphone right now.

210
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 But then I look over the other wall and I see and I asked the lady I said do you have do you have just like a single guitar hero guitar for 360 and she goes why yes we do.

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And she goes we don't get these in very often but this one just came in and then I look up and it's really clean and it's really nice and like oh shit.

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 This is where the nanites got the ball. This is where the nanites came in. This is it. It was 100 bucks so it's a splurge. But I've been trying to get one for a couple years now.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Four years since I moved out here because I really want to play Beatles rock band again because that game is just so pretty. Have you ever played Beatles rock band Jacob?

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 No. I didn't know there was a Beatles rock band. It's gorgeous. You should do yourself a favor. This reminds me of what I'm doing tonight though. I'll tell you what I'm doing tonight here in just a minute.

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Well just look up Beatles rock band at some point on YouTube and whatnot. The visuals are glorious. Oh nice. Really pretty cartoon animation.

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 By the way Celestia got tired of this conversation and just left. Yeah she's there. She's there. She's still here. She's not. Oh no she left. She's back in now. She's back in now. Great.

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Unfortunately we're still talking about the same thing Celestia. You can leave again. I'm sorry. It was still Paul's special day. Just explaining my favorite day. So we do that. So number one I'm already ahead of the game. Got my rock band guitar. I come out grinning like a fish and looks at me like I'm a crazy man.

218
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I'll just say for a fact that if it were not for Celestia, a frequent guest and friend of the show, I'd be really embarrassed that we're taking this long to get to our guest. No no no. Celestia I appreciate you indulging me because I know you will allow me to say this dumb shit for a minute.

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I just have one question. Paul, how much did you pay your optometrist to say you had a medical mystery? To give myself a special day? Yes. There's nothing I hate more than medical bullshit going on and having to get involved in the hospital. Sure sure sure.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It makes me insane. I lucked out. And I lucked out doubly because Anne actually really cares about the whole medical well-being of me. That's why married men live longer. That's exactly right. It's true. Just true. I would not have gone to do any of this already. I would have been done as soon as she said.

221
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 What else is going down with Jacob and Ice Marriage? I'll tell you that much right now. Nope. Well every time I tell Lestre I feel a little bad. She just hits me. Our next stop is the Ross Park Mall. The Ross Park Mall where gunshots rang out just the other night.

222
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Yeah. Big drama outside Pittsburgh. Oh man. So there was apparently some gang bullshit went down. Anyway whatever. But by the same token we drive in there's a big line all around the mall. We're like what the hell is this? And we park in. And sure enough it's a pop-up Sanrio shop. It's a Hello Kitty cafe van selling special Hello Kitty merchandise. And there's just a line around the block for Hello Kitty. So you got in line. I did not.

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I skipped the line and went right for the Lego store. Thank you very much. He put on he put on his sunglasses from the optometrist and carried a cane and they let him. If they had been selling if they had been selling Batsmaru merchandise possibly. And I mean I don't say no to some cool Hello Kitty stuff. That shirt of mine is one of my favorites.

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 What's Batsmaru? Batsmaru is the angry little penguin with the spiked hair. Batsmaru is what I say when I finish laying out my plan of like how we're going to pull off a heist. And then I finish with like Batsmaru. Fair dinkin'. And then we go on with that.

225
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Batsmaru is the secret code word turn off the laser that's going to cut James Bond in half. So Celestia you're running skeptic camp. Oh sorry Paul go ahead.

226
00:19:36,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Anyway no I bought Legos and bought me Legos which even better. I got treated to Legos and then we went to the whiskey store. Who's a big boy? Get your Lego. And got some whiskey. Then she drove me to the comic book shop which is in its new location. I got to go to the comic book store and now I'm back home. And we stopped at Panda Express on the way home. So I mean perfect. Perfect.

227
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 The perfect day. There was somebody that commented in the comment section that this is what happens to a dog like right before they get put down. Hey don't think Ann's not thinking about maybe this is it. I better get him some Legos before he kicks the bucket. It's possible. Anything's possible.

228
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Get him some Legos. Up the life insurance policy. Let's knock it all out. The poor woman's been traumatized. She came out here and four months later her father passes. Not even four months. Like three months. It's just like you know. So yeah. Good point Paul. Good point. She deserves to take you out and get you everything you want. She's earned it. Look. Look. It's not that. She just. It's not not that. She just really loves me. I love her too. Like crazy. It's I couldn't do anything without her at this point so.

229
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Anyway. Yeah. It's all good. So I'm having a pretty good day except for exploding eye. For whatever that is.

230
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 You know who else is having a pretty good day all except their eyeball popping out. That's the following sponsor. Oh. Today's show is god damn it. I hit the wrong window. No. The thing's opening up. Oh I've got it. Hold on. Today's show is brought to you by Johnny Australia's

231
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Johnny Australia's commercial undersea navigation and telemet. Telemetry. There you go. T. L. L. C. Johnny Australia's commercial undersea navigation and telemetry. That's C. U. N. T. L. L. C.

232
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 G'day everyone. I know you're looking to go down under. Really down under. Down under the sea. Well if you need to go under the sea just look to me. Johnny Australia with his C. U. N. T.

233
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 It'll take you everywhere you need to go and places you shouldn't. That's right. My telemetry operations will get you navigating the wonderful world of Jacques Cousteau.

234
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Yeah. But mind you don't run into those manta rays. They'll take you out in a second. They don't play around. They got a vengeance for us Aussies. They like to stab us in the heart with their spear for tails with that and that's it.

235
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And that's all she wrote. So get a cunt and go swimming. Why don't you? Huh? Yeah. And her haze group's a checkout. Yeah. Get a cunt. Buy my cunt. Okay.

236
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Celestia Ward is here. She's helping create and run a new skeptic convention. Paul, what Legos did you buy? So I got the Game Boy. I'm sorry everyone. We are out of time. Celestia, I'm so sorry. Apologies. We're going to have to bump you.

237
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Well, no, I like that. You've completely overstated what it is. So I should just leave it at that.

238
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 No, Celestia is starting her convention. It's going to be cool. What is the thing? Tell us about it.

239
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 It's not a whole convention. It's what's called a skeptic camp. Oh, okay. Skeptic camp. And they've been doing these all over the country and Las Vegas is kind of like, well, we should probably do one because, you know, Vegas has got kind of a skeptical history.

240
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 We had the amazing Randy here. We had years of the amazing meeting put on by him by the JREF, the James Randy Educational Foundation.

241
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I miss the amazing meeting happening here. I like seeing those people running around. They were a fun group to have around. It was cool.

242
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And then Randy went ahead and died. What the hell? I know.

243
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Did any of you get to pay for bacon and donut party? One time. Yep. My wife was in the band. So, yeah, I was at every bacon and donut party. That's right. Yeah.

244
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I even got to the one at the old, what's the country bar that used to be down, like all the way down by the south point that's at Town Square now? Not Smokies, but something like that.

245
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But I remember, yeah, they had it. They had like the full band down there and everything. Yeah, it was all great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have fond memories of all that stuff.

246
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Don't you think where this country is chock full of skepticism right now? Don't we have enough skepticism? Oh, yeah. Everybody, everybody from top to bottom is full on critical thinking.

247
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 That's what we're celebrating. We're celebrating the fact that the country is going great. It's a victory lap. There's no misinformation whatsoever coming at it anywhere. Yep. Good.

248
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Well, actually, you bring up a good point. So it's just a big pat on the back for the community. Just job well done, everyone. Good job. Gold stars all around.

249
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 It's just on the deck of a battleship. You're all going to be in flight suits. There's going to be a big mission accomplished banner behind you. It's going to be a whole thing.

250
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 There's nothing political. That's that's actually one of the saving graces of something like a skeptic camp. It's a place where we can talk about weird stuff like we're going to be talking about UFOs and gambling legends and how to quote unquote beat the house.

251
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And we're going to have Elvis there. And we're going to be talking about like, you know, Area 51 and I'm going to be talking about creativity and drawing and skepticism.

252
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And it's not going to be political, so hopefully people won't have their tribal masks up. And if you can teach somebody critical thinking by talking about like Bigfoot, then they can apply those skills to other things in their lives that might be a bit more weighty, might perhaps hold the future of democracy in their hands.

253
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Now that I think that is a great theory. Do you are how optimistic are you that that theory is going to work in practice? Are you very optimistic? Because I'm a little skeptical of that theory.

254
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It will never work 100%. Nothing ever works 100%. Sure, sure. It does make a difference. I mean, the most recent example is the RFK Jr. came out and said, hey, Tylenol causes autism, blah, blah, blah.

255
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 What? I didn't hear about that.

256
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 All right. So is that an example of where we should exert skepticism?

257
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I don't know what your feeds looked like after that, but mine was completely chock-a-block full of social media doctors who have made a social media presence for themselves.

258
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Every major medical organization, you know, the College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, pediatrics, you know, every branch came out and said, no, here's how you actually read the studies. No, please don't pay attention to what just happened on TV. Here's what doctors actually figure out.

259
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And here's, you know, the whole history of it. So that's, you know, public education. Skepticism has always been the intersection of science, education and consumer protection.

260
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 We don't want people to get ripped off. We don't want people to take wrong medical advice from charlatans, no matter what position of authority they might be in.

261
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And we want people to understand how the world works because it's pretty freaking cool, you know? Yeah. Right.

262
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 We want to know what the fuck is wrong with Paul's eye. Right, right, right, right. Absolutely. Yeah.

263
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And we don't want conspiracy theorists on the Internet to answer first. Oh, they will anyway. I mean, they will answer first and loudest.

264
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 What will take place at the camp? At the camp? Well, we've got a number of speakers.

265
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 We have a magician, Joan DuCour. Do you know her? Oh, I love Joan. I asked you.

266
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I asked you and you're like, oh, I'm going to be gone. So I forget what you've got going on on the 25th. But this is happening in October.

267
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I would have declined anyway, because if you want people to speak towards research and education, I'm maybe not the best example.

268
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 No, no, we just wanted magic. We just wanted somebody to perform magic. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, as a palate cleanser. Exactly.

269
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Now, here is a fish. Does anyone have a guess as to where this came from? Or was it actually magic?

270
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I would love to turn your act into a TED Talk. It's full on TED Talk.

271
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 It's not going to be magic. We've got to do that. We've got to come up with all these different topics that your act could lend itself to.

272
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 I'm skeptical about whether those are his baseball cards from when he was a child and if they are baseball cards.

273
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Well, I mean, every magician you ever watch should be watched with skepticism. You should not be assuming they have miraculous powers.

274
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 But that's why skeptic magicians get along. But actually, that is the absolute truth.

275
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Is that like it's not like if we if we were allowed to actually making people think we were magical, that would be a really weird profession.

276
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And that is how some magicians pursued their paths over the years, especially historically.

277
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 But no, it's exactly like the more skeptical the audience is, the more the magic tricks really get reactions. Right.

278
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 So that's that's that's what you're trying to do. So you are relying on an audience for being intelligent.

279
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Well, many, many magicians do. Some magicians don't.

280
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Have you had the experience in your career as a magician?

281
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Have you had the experience other magicians have kind of awkwardly felt really weird about where somebody comes up to you after and they're like, oh, you really have these amazing powers.

282
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Hey, my sister has cancer. Is there anything I do, you know, where they have not honestly think you have miracle powers and then they immediately hit you with some kind of big life request.

283
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Long term listeners will remember that someone wanted to become my apprentice at the end of one of my shows.

284
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Some guy thought I was actually doing magic and then he was writing things down creepily on a piece of paper throughout my entire show.

285
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 They came to show me the things he was writing down and wanted to let me know that he was on the path to figuring these things out, too, and wanted to become my apprentice.

286
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And I could not get him to leave me alone for hours.

287
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 This was in Elkton, Maryland, and I am still here, though.

288
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I would still like to be your apprentice.

289
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Jacob's not that wrong on the voice.

290
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And it was a really strange situation in which I was conceding like, no, you know, get out of here.

291
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 The most embarrassing story of that is that I was doing pre show for Piff the Magic Dragon when I was dressed up as a giant like night king person.

292
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And I would just work on some card tricks before Piff and the dog came up for the VIP experience.

293
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 So I did what's called a lie detector test where I have, you know, give people cards and say, I want you to say yes, no matter what, to every question I asked, you know, is it a heart?

294
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Is it a spade? Is it red? Is it black? Is it the number card? Is it a face card?

295
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And I have them repeat the answers over and over again. They say yes every time.

296
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And then I go up, you know, three of hearts and they go, oh, you nailed it.

297
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And a guy was like, hey, I teach psychology at my high school.

298
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Could you maybe go over some of the principles you used for that?

299
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And I could maybe use it in my school. And I was like, oh, buddy, the guy dressed like a knight doing pre show for a dog is not someone who has mastered body language.

300
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Well, that's that's that actually hits back to some pseudoscience.

301
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I mean, that they I don't know if you remember that show Lie to Me.

302
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It was based loosely on Paul Ekman's work where he honestly believed you could detect lies just by seeing micro expressions and everything.

303
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 And yes, yeah, yeah.

304
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 The Secret Service has claimed to be able to do that for years.

305
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 The Secret Service claims that they teach micro expression reading to their agents and they claim that their agents are the best at seeing seeing lies happen of all of the whatever agencies around the world.

306
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 It always sounds like bullshit. Anytime I hear somebody talk about it, it just sounds like total bullshit.

307
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Well, everyone has a version of a bullshit or lie detector in themselves, right?

308
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 We all know or think when someone's fucking with us or lying with us or whatever.

309
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 So it makes sense that someone in a government agency would suddenly exert a lot of ego and energy into that element of things.

310
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But yeah, I mean, it's all you know.

311
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And that's why like even like lately there was even like a government threat about polygraphing people for trying to control.

312
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 I was about to say Kristi Noem has decided to polygraph like a ton of people looking for whoever's leaking stuff.

313
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 It is now widely known. Like I think it's widely known that polygraphs do not work.

314
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Yes, but not widely enough.

315
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 It is the subject of television shows, books, all the like it's it is as widely known I think as anything can be.

316
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 But it's not widely known that it doesn't work.

317
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I was once hooked up to a polygraph by a police officer.

318
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 I have been to wait in a real situation. I was applying for a job with the police department.

319
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 This is like 20 years ago. Mine was not a real situation at all.

320
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I got to the finals. Like, you know, it was like me and like five other people for the position and they hooked me up.

321
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And I'm like, this probably lost me the job. I was like, you guys know these don't work, right?

322
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And he's like, well, it depends on who's giving it.

323
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And if the person who's giving it knows how to read those, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

324
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I believe you can be better than other people at it.

325
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 But it's not it's not it doesn't just work.

326
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 It can be used as a tool to leverage people to make them a sweat.

327
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 It's it's a thing. Yeah, it can be used as a tool.

328
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 But it's not it's not Wonder Woman's magic lasso.

329
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 No. Which policy just paid $250 for a kit and caboodle at a magic shop special day.

330
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Absolutely. Wonder Woman has three magic glasses.

331
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 So one is the lasso of truth. One is the lasso of faith and the other's chastity.

332
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Yeah, that's the truth. Faith, faith and chastity.

333
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 I can't remember it because absolute Wonder Woman is from hell now. It's awesome.

334
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 So that's great. Raised by Circe in hell. It's it's you have roughly 20 minutes of talking material that you can do on Wonder Woman now.

335
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Look, I'm not going back into another Celestia layout. Let Paul cook. Let's go.

336
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Look, hey, let's just hear that. No, Celestia, what?

337
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 A winner scoop in the chat while Paul's thinking of his question says that they failed a polygraph that they had 100 percent told the truth on and they have a stress disorder.

338
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Yeah. So false, false negatives on that one. Yeah, that's that's an interesting one that I had not heard of either.

339
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 What's the most important question to ask when you're starting to approach a topic from a skeptical or critical thinking point of view?

340
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 What do you think is like the most important way to start a position of intellectual humility?

341
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Because you could always be your own, your own bias. I like that skepticism is is really about learning that your brain is broken in any number of ways.

342
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Everybody else's are, too. But your own biases are so powerful.

343
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Well, that is that is a secret between like atheists and the very religious, right? Like religious people can't believe how know it all atheists are and atheists can't believe that people of faith have such faith.

344
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Right. And so they both accuse the other of being an arrogant know it all all the time.

345
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 But but if you truly are coming at stuff from a scientific perspective, I mean, even just as an improviser, I've been doing it for a long time.

346
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I still don't know everything there is to know about how to do it best. I still don't know the best techniques.

347
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And when you learn more about theater and performance, you know that you don't know.

348
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Well, you're describing Dunning Kruger. I mean, the fact that people who are experts get pretty humble about like how much else there is to learn in that right.

349
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 That's it. He sees a 20 minute video on YouTube and they're like, I know the doctors are lying to us.

350
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 You know, yeah, but that's where I live is in Dunning Kruger.

351
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Play not that side of it. But Paul, you just ready Kruger. You live in Freddy Kruger. I do every night.

352
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 You're mine, bitch. Yeah, very, very scary.

353
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Freddy Dunning Kruger is a whole nother. Somebody has to have done. What do you think? What do you think is reality formed by dream or is dream part of reality?

354
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Huh? Bitch. Yeah.

355
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Freddy Dunning Kruger is the name of a 2024 rock music single by the Manchester based band.

356
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Of course it has a good job. Manchester based band either.

357
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 I'm surprised it took until 2024. I'm going to have to look that up.

358
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 We're going to have to play that at the skeptic camp. That sounds funny.

359
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Yeah, if it's the right thing. Yeah, it's October 25th Saturday.

360
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 We're starting at nine a.m. We're going all the way through to seven p.m. We're going to have a game show.

361
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 We're going to have talks. We're going to have activities.

362
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 We're going to have free lunch. You do have to register. Go to LVSOS dot com to register.

363
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 That stands for the Las Vegas Society of Skeptics dot com LVSOS dot com.

364
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Just it's a quick Google form. You'd say if you're going, if you have any minor kids you're bringing with you, blah, blah, blah.

365
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And we will hopefully be able to have enough food for everybody if everybody registers on time.

366
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 And we've got a lovely venue down over on the east side of Las Vegas.

367
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 It is actually at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Las Vegas on Lake Mead.

368
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And I was a little hesitant that, you know, one of one of our organizers is a member there and she's a total atheist.

369
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And there's a lot of atheists in the Universalist Congregation.

370
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 And I'm like, a church, really? And she's like, as a member, I can get us the venue for free.

371
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 And I'm like, OK. And I went over membership. Now you're talking.

372
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 It's perfect. There's like a big lecture hall area.

373
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 There's break rooms. There's like it's absolutely a wonderful place to hold an event.

374
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Oh, yeah. Skirt Fest guys have it all figured out.

375
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Yeah. And no, no taxes.

376
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Hey, so Celestia, I have to say I'm a little bit skeptical.

377
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 I've heard there's no such thing as a free lunch.

378
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 I'm skeptical that it's going to start promptly at nine a.m.

379
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 You have to be skeptical about both of those things.

380
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 The lunch is not free. Organizers are shelling out some some money to help.

381
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Actually, we are also asking people to bring some non-perishables because they run a food bank for the community.

382
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Oh, how nice. So it's sort of in exchange for all these lectures from cool people.

383
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 We've got Brian Dunning of Skeptoid.com is coming out. Oh, great.

384
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Susan Gerbic of she's known as the Wikipedia attrition.

385
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 She's like the organizer of Gorilla Skeptics on Wikipedia.

386
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 She's coming out and giving a talk. Kyle Polish of Data Skeptic.

387
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 He's going to be talking about gambling math and everything.

388
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 So nerds will have a really good time at this and bring some canned food or non-perishables for the food pantry.

389
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 And hopefully you'll get a sandwich from the catered sandwiches we're going to be bringing in.

390
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Nice. Yeah. And there'll be a taco truck for dinner.

391
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Oh, you need a whole truck? Yes.

392
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 The first person to finish the truck will win a taco.

393
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 But is it taco?

394
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 That was my is it cake joke about a taco truck.

395
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Oh, is it cake? Oh, no, it ran. It ran. No, no, it's better.

396
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 It's funny when I explain it.

397
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 That was just as funny.

398
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Celestia, you stopped by ScoopFest and you did filthy caricatures.

399
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 I did. And I was so mad I couldn't do it last ScoopFest.

400
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Andy Taylor had to cover for me because I had pneumonia.

401
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Oh, and he wasn't nearly as good. No, he was tame. He was tame.

402
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 He said he said it was more stress. If I'm remembering correctly, he said it was a bit more stress than he thought it would be.

403
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Because really, your brain cells are going like in all different directions for weeks beforehand.

404
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 They're lined up for you. Yeah. I was trying to think of like dirty things I could draw in five minutes.

405
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And, you know, I'm actually very relieved to not have to think about these things anymore because it was one of those like intrusive thoughts.

406
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 I just have these images going around my head all the time.

407
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Okay, I can do somebody like that. Oh, I can draw somebody doing that, too. And if I have two people, if I have three people, blah, blah, blah. Yeah.

408
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Did you did you have any ideas that you weren't able to use?

409
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Yeah, I had quite a few that I wasn't able to use because a lot of more more than I expected.

410
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 People sat down and it just sort of happened like stuff I didn't even think about beforehand, like the two guys in a banana suit.

411
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 I mean, yeah, that was. I have never in my life drawn two guys in a banana suit having sex so vigorously that the Chiquita sticker pops off.

412
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 But that was hella fun to draw. Right. When you didn't draw, that's what they were doing.

413
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 But what did you draw while they were doing that? Oh, I drew them sipping cosmopolitans.

414
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Oh, that's nice. That's nice. They were fucking each other raw.

415
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 People I showed some of these pictures off. I didn't put them on Facebook, but I showed them to some private friends and everything.

416
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 They're like, what was this thing you drew? Was this like a swinger's party? And I'm like, no, no, not at all.

417
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 This is not a sex camp thing. These are just not officially.

418
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Sex camp is October 25th in the basement of the church.

419
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Sex camp, sex camp. Yeah, but I honestly I think a swinger's party would be way less fun because I mean, you all are just a loving community of open minded, humorous people.

420
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 And I think I was talking to Brian Brushwood afterwards and he said, it's like the horseshoe. It's like the horseshoe theory. He's like, we've got a lot of really smart people here.

421
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 But at the end of the horseshoe, there's also a lot of really dumb people.

422
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 So we've got like the smartest dumb people and the dumbest smart people all gathered to do fun things.

423
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 I'm in the dumbest quality area. Yeah, I rely on the scoops brain power. I'll tell you how dumb I am in the dumber smart category.

424
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 I'm so dumb. I've got my old Apple computer here that has all my music on and everything.

425
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And I've locked myself out and I can't remember my password and I'm just fucked.

426
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 I've just got to sit here for days to try and get the password on this damn computer.

427
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 And if I don't get it, I'm going to lose thousands of dollars of music.

428
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 It's going to make me so sad. Somebody popped up on socials the other day.

429
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 It was some some sporting person, I think, had lost the password to their Bitcoin wallet.

430
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 Oh, no. They had they had a bunch of Bitcoin in this wallet for back when it was very cheap.

431
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And somebody had given him like 40 Bitcoin or 400 Bitcoin or something.

432
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 And they don't know the password. And it's a few million dollars in there.

433
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there was one.

434
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Wasn't it somebody on here that told us the story of how they had paid an ex-girlfriend for pizza in Bitcoin?

435
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Right. But it was it was the only Bitcoin that that ex-girlfriend had ever gotten.

436
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 So he wasn't sure if she even knew that she had some bitcoins that were worth like one point something million dollars.

437
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Yes. And he had not talked to that ex-girlfriend in a while.

438
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 I don't know who that was. That was some story from the from the way back past.

439
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 It's a scoop mail, wasn't it? It was a scoop mail.

440
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 It might have been a scoop mail or a guest or something.

441
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Yeah. Somebody somebody will tell us over the next over the next week or two.

442
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 I'm sure somebody will see somebody will remember that.

443
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 But I am not an economic expert at all, but Bitcoin skeeves me out.

444
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 I don't know. It's like it's math and it's I agree with that.

445
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 And I've always thought that it's so much math, so gross math all over me.

446
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 I love math. I just I just don't know if I'm comfortable with using math as currency.

447
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 I don't know if I'm comfortable with math.

448
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 I am not. Well, I know what you're talking about, Celestia, because it makes sense to everybody else.

449
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 The rest of us are all on board with it. I stand corrected.

450
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 I'll go invest.

451
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 I thought like you were you get hired to do these like crazy gigs all the time.

452
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 I saw what were you doing caricatures on mugs and calling them mug shots.

453
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 I thought that's pretty neat. I was. Yes. Yeah.

454
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Is this what's what is the is I've never I guess I don't know how to ask this.

455
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Is the is the character world evolving? Like what's happening?

456
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Yeah, the industry is going through some stuff. And I always feel like this kind of indicates times of economic uncertainty when party planners call you.

457
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 And instead of just, hey, come do the regular thing you've done for years and years, they're like, we want you to do your thing.

458
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 But we've got this weird idea and we want to try and capitalize on your talents by doing this other thing.

459
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 And so they fit you into all the jujube it up. Yeah, they try to jujube it up.

460
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 And so the latest thing has been drawing on napkins has gotten really big.

461
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Like, oh, like you pretend you're Pablo Picasso and you're drawing on napkins for people at the night going by yourself, a college education.

462
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Yeah, go and go and take your child to Madrid. Yes.

463
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 And then go and buy a vacation home.

464
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, buy you a house.

465
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 None of my napkin scribbles will get anybody a college education.

466
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 Right now. But once you're dead and appreciated.

467
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Look the fuck out.

468
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 That's what it happens. Unless you're Pablo. Who else?

469
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Who else got that right? Got that ride like Pablo Picasso.

470
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Who else came came up with it and still. Yeah.

471
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Like, I mean, who else was John Michelle Basquiat?

472
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 I was gonna say Basquiat, Warhol.

473
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 See, Paul's relying on the scoops for intelligence.

474
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 But Basquiat passed away very young. He didn't get to ride it for long.

475
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 That's right. He didn't he didn't ride it for long, but he rode it quite a bit.

476
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I mean, he would he would he would go into grocery store gas stations with no money to buy a pack of cigarettes and then just doodle on a receipt.

477
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 And, you know, just that that was his life for a while.

478
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 OK, so he did. OK, cool. That is a that's cool.

479
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Let's try that today. I know many artists who have gotten free drinks from it and they're not Basquiat or or anybody famous.

480
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 But, you know, it's been a longtime way to get free drinks.

481
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 But what what the agents are now having artists do, you know, caricature artists in Las Vegas working trade shows and parties and corporate events is there.

482
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 And I'm feeling a connection here, Matt, to what you do.

483
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 And I'm finally understanding the draw of it here. No pun intended.

484
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 They're having me do stealth caricatures, which means I hang out in a corner.

485
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 I stand up against a wall. I draw on a little clipboard and then I slide it to the unsuspecting model who has no idea I've been drawing them.

486
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 Whoa. And the male artists I know, the male caricature artists hate to do this.

487
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 They're like, I feel creepy. I'm sliding. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Handing them. It's like it's like the bird watching binoculars don't help.

489
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 That makes that makes it more creepy. But I got to tell you, I was born to do this.

490
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Celestia uses opera glasses. I just oh, that would be lovely.

491
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 I'm going to have to do that now. The glasses actually help because it makes it harder for people to see that I'm staring at them from like 20 feet away.

492
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. And and I've got progressive lenses so I can look far or near or far or near.

493
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 And technology. Well, that's what I always tell the ladies that I'm staring at.

494
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 I'm like, hey, these are progressive. I'm as progressive as they come. I'm looking far and then near.

495
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 I'm staring at you progressively. Near. Far.

496
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 From near and far. I'd like to break off a piece of that action. Come on now.

497
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 I'm Paul Mattingly. How you doing? I have never been a magician. I have never been a stealthy person.

498
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 But I am an overweight middle aged white woman.

499
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 You you put me in a trade show room with a clipboard and I am a ninja.

500
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Nobody sees me. I am. I blend into the wallpaper.

501
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 I look like every other. The bartenders think I'm keeping tabs on how much they're pouring.

502
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 They get a little nervous. Oh, near.

503
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 That's one of the higher nups. Near. Rocks.

504
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 But when you when you slide the drawing, how do you when and how do you deliver those?

505
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 That's the magic part. Plenty of times I just handed to them and say this is for you.

506
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 But a lot of times I can slide it right next to them on if they're at the bar,

507
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 if they're sitting at a table, kind of they're at a cocktail table.

508
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 I've even been able to put it in one guy's pocket without him realizing it.

509
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 And they they don't notice. Not only do they not notice.

510
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Sometimes only one person out of the group will notice it or nobody will notice it.

511
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 And I just skulk off and I like you can count one, two, three, four, five.

512
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 And then they're like, oh, my God, what the heck?

513
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 You know, and this explosion of like somebody has drawn my picture.

514
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 And how did this where did they go?

515
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 And sometimes they're looking for me in a panic for like the next 20 minutes.

516
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 I bet people chase me down by the end of the night going, how did you even do this?

517
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 I didn't see you. And it's people are so unobservant.

518
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 Oh, my God. If I was evil, I could I could have ripped off every single one of them,

519
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 taken all of their purses and wallets. But I just remember my password.

520
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 So I'm on cloud nine right now. I just unlocked thousands of dollars of music for myself.

521
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 Everything's coming up. Everything's coming up.

522
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 This is going to be the best day of my life before we're done here.

523
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Also, I'm enjoying the hell out of this episode. I'm glad to see Celestia.

524
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 We've got we've had more people in the room than we've ever had, guys.

525
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 We keep going up. We had we had forty two, which is our max now that we've had so far.

526
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 And everything's happening in the universe and everything.

527
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 Things keep going up. Exactly. So things keep going up.

528
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 This is great. This is great. This is great.

529
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 I'm loving it. Yeah. You scoops are here for my best day ever.

530
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 Do you want to tell me when your password so that you have it as a backup?

531
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 I sure don't. I sure do not. I sure do not.

532
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Winner scoops suggest that you write it down. Yes.

533
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 I am going to write it down a thousand times. Yes.

534
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 Celestia, has there once has there been any requests you've had to say no to people trying to make your your profession into something maybe more difficult?

535
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 Oh, yeah. I had somebody recently asked if I could draw on golf balls.

536
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Oh, God, damn, that sounds awful.

537
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 And I, you know, I was a little snarky. I was like, um, I've drawn on coffee mugs and napkins and other stuff.

538
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 Golf, you know, unless the people have a lot of dimples, I'm not going to draw them on a golf ball.

539
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 Could you say, uh, who's golf?

540
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 Yeah, who's golf? Oh!

541
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 Hey, sure thing, but is he OK with it?

542
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 Welcome to my golf party. I'm Joe Golf.

543
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 You're going to draw my balls tonight.

544
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 I haven't had to draw on people. I, that's another...

545
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 You've never drawn, that's what I was, you've never drawn on skin?

546
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 Well, I have, but I haven't been paid to do it.

547
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 OK. Have you, uh, was this for like a, was this for a tat, was this for a tattoo possibly or?

548
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 No, no, that's the reason why I would never be a tattoo artist.

549
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 Everybody always asks, oh, you should get into tattoos and blah, blah, blah.

550
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 Number one, the tattoo market is flooded. Everybody and their mother want to be the tattoo artist in the 90s and noughts.

551
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 But I don't like the idea of something I draw.

552
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 You know, if you don't like it, I want you to be able to throw it away.

553
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 So drawing on napkins and cups, maybe drawing on garbage is for me, I guess.

554
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 I have never been able to get a tattoo.

555
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 You can get rid of that tattoo.

556
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 Oh, God.

557
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 Here's a question for Briar.

558
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Have you ever had someone ask you if they could get one of your works tattooed?

559
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 I have. I haven't. I've had somebody send me photographs of it.

560
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 Gosh, it's been a while. I've had somebody, you know, because occasionally people like have their loved ones caricatured and then plaster their wife and kid on them from the caricature.

561
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 And that's happened to me a couple of times. And then I had this one guy, the only time I've actually been like, yeah, cool. All right.

562
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 He said, I'd like you to draw my tattoo design.

563
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 And I'm like, well, it was really slow. I was at a caricature. I was at the caricature stand.

564
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 Logos or tattoos. When you go to a caricature artist and you're like, hey, can you invest five minutes in something I want to make permanent for my business or my body?

565
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 You're already dealing with somebody who cuts corners.

566
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 It's not a great idea. But he wanted to he wanted to have a tattoo that would win him bar bets.

567
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 And so he explained he wanted a a rooster in a noose, like the new the rooster was being, you know, and he said this was going to win him bar bets.

568
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 And I'm like, OK, I could draw a rooster in a noose. Tell me how it's going to win you a bar bet.

569
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 And he said, well, he's betting people that he has a tattoo of a rooster with a noose on it.

570
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 And they say, I bet you don't have that. He says, ha ha, I won. I'm I'm waiting for one of you to guess. But if you don't guess, I'll tell you.

571
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 There's a chicken chicken chicken. He said, I'll show my cock in this bar.

572
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 Well hung cock. I'll choke my chicken in his bar. He was he was going to tattoo it right below his knee.

573
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 And he was going to bet people that he has a cock hanging below his knee. Oh, that's funny.

574
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 Yeah. So the person doesn't want to blow you anymore.

575
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 That's pretty funny. We know these jokes well.

576
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 We know these jokes. We all know these jokes very well. These are jokes that are better in theory.

577
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 There are a lot of physical bits that are just better in theory.

578
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 I know one of the nursing home argument, which is like the moment the nurse is like coming in there and you're like, oh, God, is this a low hanging chicken joke?

579
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 Fuck you. Eat your applesauce.

580
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 Oh, the nurse at the retirement home. Hey, hey, sweetie.

581
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 I bet you I got a cock hanging below my knee. You have dementia. That's right. Yeah, yeah.

582
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 You told me yesterday the same joke every day, Taryn.

583
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 Did you blow me? I did yesterday. I blew you, buddy.

584
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 Oh, I bet that was great. It was. Thanks, pal. Oh, well, good. You want to blow me again? I don't have your applesauce.

585
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 Oh, I do like applesauce.

586
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 You know who else likes applesauce from old men who have pictures of cocks on their knees. That's the following sponsor.

587
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 From the Gorilla Dentist from that Bjork video from the makers of Hemp Burlap Boxer Shorts.

588
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 It's Permanently Wet Socks.

589
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 Hey, how's it going, everybody? I'm a creepy Best Buy guy.

590
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 I just want you to know that sales are way, way down.

591
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 We had like three stores left and decided to expand our inventory.

592
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 Unfortunately, we rented a warehouse and all we had was socks.

593
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 The warehouse got compromised. Somebody put a bunch of milk in it.

594
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 I don't know who would put a bunch of milk on socks.

595
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 Milk socks, gross.

596
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 We got an abundance of damp old milk socks.

597
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 And if you're looking to buy some, I can get them for you real cheap.

598
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
 What if I'm not looking to buy some?

599
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 Then I'm going to put them on you while you're tied up.

600
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 I'm going to slowly leech the milk out with my mouth.

601
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 I'm going to suck the rancid milk out of your socks while I leave your socks on.

602
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 The best thing about having rancid milk socks is just a couple of weeks of wearing them.

603
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 You've basically made yourself a whole vat of cottage cheese in your shoes.

604
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 It's really nice. Enter H Groups to check out.

605
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 On the one hand, I was going to tell Jacob it was too loud to hear Paul, and then I was like, I'm fine with that.

606
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 That's fine.

607
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 That was a little extra disgusting, Paul.

608
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 But that's what I do. That's what I'm paid for.

609
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 Celestia, Paul's having a day.

610
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 Let's get it straight. Thanks to my exploding eye and my beloved wife Anne McFeeters, I am on the brink of having the best day of my life.

611
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 The best day of my life.

612
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 And that includes all of you being here.

613
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 You are party to the best day of my life so far.

614
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 So far. It's going to keep getting better.

615
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 It is a commercial that Anne's going to fast forward, just so we're clear.

616
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 She is. You know what? Also, I would say that our, like, Scoop Fest for me was one of the highlights of my life.

617
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 This last Scoop Fest was really, really good.

618
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 But easily top 10 things that I've done in my life.

619
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 And I would say, Matt, you and I, our bucket shows, were easily top three performances of my life.

620
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 These bucket shows were just off the hook for some reason.

621
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 Paul was ready to retire from stage performance after this bucket show.

622
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
 I loved those bucket shows so much. They were really good.

623
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 Yeah, go ahead.

624
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 Both shows found, like, a really great button.

625
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 And when we were, like, when my improv group were, like, maniacs, when we were all, like, eight equally dedicated maniacs about long form improv,

626
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 you would find those buttons in our shows. And it was, like, so satisfying.

627
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 Yes.

628
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 Where you actually bring a kind of wave of callbacks and, like, something dovetails that changes a character into something that suddenly fits the puzzle.

629
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 It's so hard to describe, but when it happens, and so, and basically, Mark Roberts did it twice.

630
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
 That's what I was going to say. I was going to say, Mark, big thanks to Mark and Brenna both for bringing an amazing energy to it, too.

631
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 It wasn't just us this time.

632
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 No. And it felt retro, like we called the shows on the buttons, and I was like, man, I haven't felt like this in a long time.

633
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Absolutely. I will never forget.

634
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 Because a lot of long form teams, including our other bucket shows, you can ape it, right?

635
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 You can kind of, like, push it the way that the audience feels like it's cute and it's enough and it's close enough and yeah, we get it.

636
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 Or even just end on a laugh. Yeah.

637
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:57,000
 But these, you're absolutely right, there was a symmetry and an actual connectivity to it all.

638
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 It paid the fuck off. Both of them had payoffs.

639
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 And it's interesting because, yeah, when I teach improv, I said there's a difference between a callback and a connection.

640
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 Yes.

641
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 And it was really hard to illustrate it, and both ended with really strong connections and not just callbacks.

642
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 Yes.

643
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 It was really, it was really nice.

644
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
 Can I ask you guys as improvisers?

645
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Because I have this recent fear as a caricature artist, because I've watched many caricature artists before me kind of, you get, you know, your 20s, you're kind of sucking, you get better, you learn more, you get more experience, you get quicker.

646
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 You get, suddenly you're in the mentor position, and I turned 50 recently, and you guys are kind of around the same age, where you feel like you're in your prime.

647
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 And you're like, I am bringing all this experience to bear, I'm faster than I've ever been, I'm doing well, and then you're like, how long until I'm one of the old people who loses my edge?

648
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 Because you also see that. Are you guys like, trying to milk every, no pun intended, you're trying to milk sock every moment?

649
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 You're prime here? Are you worried that like, in another 10 years, this could all just be like, you know, you're not hitting it anymore?

650
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 Great question. Can I answer first, Matt, and let you say next what you think?

651
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 You're already faster than me, right? So is everybody showing you how slow I'm getting with age? Yes, go ahead.

652
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 So, here's my thing. And I think about when I was real, I was, I've had a couple of really cooking times in my career.

653
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 And the one was when I was part-time Trek, full-time Second City, and going back and forth between shows. Well, I was understudying.

654
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 What, were you Trekking? Motherfucker. Anyway, there were days when I would do seven hours of Klingon, get a shower at the Hilton, take the monorail to the Flamingo, and do two shows at night.

655
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 I was firing on all fucking cylinders. I was a young man doing it. I didn't know at the time that that was a prime time of my physical and mental performance time.

656
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 We never do. Aha, but this is the difference, Jacob. I think with age, we do sometimes know.

657
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 Like, I am very conscious of the fact that that last, that that last Scoop Fest was great, and those Bucket Show performances were very high bar.

658
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 So I think, Celestia, as long as you know you're doing well, you won't become the old daughterer.

659
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 You won't become the butt of the joke, because unless your mental faculties completely fail you, there may or may not come a point where you go, you know what, time to hang up the gloves.

660
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:04,000
 Self-awareness is the key. I think, well, and I think that's the key, but it's also, just like we were talking about with skepticism and the Dunning-Kruger and all that kind of thing, you know how good you are right now.

661
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 But you also still know, is it fair to say you still find yourself improving and growing and learning new techniques, even to this day?

662
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 Oh, absolutely. I tell people the day that I stop learning how to draw is when I'm going to stop drawing.

663
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 That's it. So I think the other side of it, too, is with the age comes the awareness of, "Hey, I am really doing really well right now. I've had 50 years of this shit. I remember when things go to hell."

664
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 This is not one of those times. Things are going pretty good. Yeah, yeah.

665
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 It does give you a certain perspective, for sure.

666
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 And perspective is the big word there. So long as you have the perspective on it all, I don't think you're going to lose it.

667
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 Again, time, physicality, mental things, your eyes hemorrhaging, those are stuff outside of your control.

668
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 That's the only way I can see something coming up to where you become the person that shouldn't be there anymore. That's my thought. What did you think, Matt?

669
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 Just the same. I know. I actually know I've peaked. I'm not as good of an improviser as I used to be.

670
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 Oh, what are you talking about?

671
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:33,000
 No, no, no. I'm going to speak honestly here. This isn't like a "woe is me" thing. I think I've gotten very... someone told me once, and this might be totally wrong,

672
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 but Krav Maga was supposed to be this martial arts form where you boil down every other martial arts form to its simple, most lethal moves, where you just do the most correct, different things.

673
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:51,000
 And I think as I've gotten older, I simply have developed a Krav Maga style of improv, where I'm still intellectually...

674
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
 Those are the Gracies, right?

675
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
 What's that?

676
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 No, that's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Krav Maga is Israeli, I believe. It was developed for the Israeli military.

677
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 Yeah. I used to play a lot more different characters, do a lot more different voices, do a lot more different things.

678
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 I'm very much now just kind of a very much different versions of myself in almost all of my scenes. I just have lost that ability.

679
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 I got to talk about this. For my freaking movement final in my BFA acting class, I walked around like a polar bear for an hour and a half and behaved, and that was a final I got.

680
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 And there's no way I could do that now.

681
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 Just imagine if somebody asked you to.

682
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 And there are artists, right? There are clowns and stuff that we know that can simply just commit to energy and do that kind of stuff.

683
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
 Absolutely, yeah.

684
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 I used to be able to make up songs so well that I would go to coffee houses and just grab a guitar player or keyboard player and just sit in and do three funny songs for the audience and kill and just go around.

685
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 I spontaneously took over a coffee house one time and put on an improvised concert.

686
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:15,000
 I used to destroy with song stuff, and Paul has held on to his song construction abilities for improv so much better than I have. I can go for one or two verses of best.

687
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
 It's the weed, Matt. It's the weed.

688
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:25,000
 Yeah, I party hard. I did my fair share of smoking. I did my fair share of drinking.

689
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 Oh, I thought Paul was saying he was high all the time.

690
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm stoned when I'm coming up with a lot of good bits. No, no, no.

691
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 I swore off short form as a long form zealot for over a decade, right?

692
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 Mistake.

693
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:48,000
 Where I practiced those skills, right? And it was only moving to Vegas that I was like, oh, I actually was skilled at this. It wasn't easy and fun for everybody. It was something I was good at.

694
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:57,000
 And so I stopped rapping, so that was offensive for college white dudes to rap. And so I stopped rapping.

695
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 You may not have been completely wrong about that part.

696
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 Right. And so those skills deteriorated. But I still understand improv, I think, at a high level, right?

697
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 Yes.

698
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 I think I still see the performance piece for what it is better than nothing.

699
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 Better than nothing.

700
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:33,000
 You used to get a little prickly about this, and I wonder if you still do. People would comment every now and then that you were a really, this years ago, people would comment every now and then that you were a really good improv show runner from on stage.

701
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 Yes.

702
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
 You used to get a little prickly about that. Do you still or no?

703
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:47,000
 It's a hard thing, right? Because basically, am I actually doing what I'm supposed to be doing, which is ego-less improv, right?

704
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 When you get into long form, there's kind of like a zen approach where you're just trying to make the pieces happen and unfold, and you're really not supposed to be that egotistical about it.

705
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:01,000
 And so, yes, I'd have people be like, you know, I thought you were just okay, and then I saw you multiple shows and realized how much you were doing, that kind of stuff.

706
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 That kind of copy would come up all the time. But what Paul was referencing earlier is that I see the pieces, right?

707
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 So I go, oh, this is starting off great, but it's running in this direction, and if we don't counter and do a different kind of scene over here and do something differently over here, this piece is going to implode in 15 minutes.

708
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 You're always thinking big picture on stage, for sure.

709
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 This is why we work well together.

710
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 Yeah.

711
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 Because I get lost in the sauce.

712
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 Yeah. That's what I tell people working with you, Paul, is I go, Paul, if I wanted to make a scene, simply take a half hour and two pieces, I would just come out and start a scene with Paul, and Paul would play that character unflinchingly for a half hour.

713
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 He wouldn't give me a look. He wouldn't give me a wink. He would not look up. And other performers I perform with would kind of give me a look, like, are we really doing this kind of thing?

714
01:09:48,000 --> 01:10:03,000
 Paul does not. Paul buckles in and goes. And so, yes, I think my biggest compliment to Paul is that I can create, make sure we create different worlds, make sure we're not imploding, make sure we're peppering different people into different universes and making sure that we're--

715
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 And while I have elements of those thoughts, you're thinking in a very elegant, structural way about what does the show need.

716
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
 Yes.

717
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:34,000
 Then when you make an initiation that will facilitate that, I have the luck and the, it gives me the opportunity to then shovel in something that also wedges with that.

718
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
 Yeah.

719
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:47,000
 You know, but like, on my own, I wouldn't necessarily make as good a choice. That's what I always tell my students. There are no wrong choices in improvisation. There are better choices.

720
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 Right.

721
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 And what Matt helps me do is he sets me up with better choices. He aims me towards the better choices.

722
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
 And that's why Paul encourages his students to go to Matt and ask to be his apprentice.

723
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 No, because on my own, I will be a crazed goofball. And while it may be entertaining, it won't necessarily hold together.

724
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
 Right.

725
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 The way it does when we work together.

726
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 Yeah. I mean, Paul and I have taught workshops together and Paul will teach these crazy character workshops where he teaches people just to buckle in, make choices, double down, go harder, you know, take it to a, take it to a 10, you know, that kind of stuff, be unflinching.

727
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:32,000
 And I will teach pattern play and rule threes and all kinds of stuff just so that all those things that kind of pepper a thing. So like an example for everyone listening is we're getting so in the weeds on this.

728
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
 That sounds like good cop, bad cop.

729
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
 No, no, no.

730
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
 It is, guys.

731
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 It's not completely disrelated from that.

732
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,000
 We have totally different education. Paul and I have a totally different improv background. Our teachers and our schools of thinking are completely different from one another.

733
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:01,000
 And, like, if you watch a show and there's multiple people, there's a thing called a tag out where someone from the background will come in, touch the floor on the shoulder, and the person staying on stage remains the same character.

734
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:09,000
 And that person becomes another person in that person's universe. You can change locations wherever you are. You just go to another spot and that person and that character's life.

735
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 And the biggest thing I do is an example of what Paul's talking about. As I say, that is a challenge to everyone else on the back line.

736
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
 Can we make this a rule of threes?

737
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
 Whatever this person does with that character, can you all follow that lead and make it two and three?

738
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:33,000
 And then when you do that, you look brilliant to an audience that you all can play that way, you know, and stuff like that.

739
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 And so that's an example of, like, that's just a technique thing and creating triggers in people's brains that make their forms better.

740
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 But all right, let's change the subject. I think you're going to have to charge up tuition. This is like a workshop.

741
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:57,000
 Well, but that's more like a camp. To Celestia's point, Matt, given that that whole talk there. Yeah.

742
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 What do you think keeps you and what do you think will keep Celestia from falling into the obsolescence category?

743
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 I remember going out to Improv Olympic when I was, you know, 20 something years old. I think I think maybe just even 20.

744
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:19,000
 You know, my whole improv group, we went out to Chicago and just stayed on the couches of Mission Improvable for a week and we took workshops every day.

745
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
 Chicago went to shows every night at Improv Olympic.

746
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:33,000
 And that was when I realized I really liked long form more than short form is because I saw older guys killing it on stage, like doing really great funny scenes.

747
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
 And I was like, oh, good, because I'm becoming that that's it.

748
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
 I was like, that gives me hope. Right. Because I felt like when I watched and this might be wrong and I'm sorry for any listeners who do this fits.

749
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
 But like I felt like when I saw older people doing short form, it looked kind of cheeseball to me when I was young. Right.

750
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 I don't know if that would be that way now, but it did look that way then.

751
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
 And so I was so excited that you could still be characters. You could still do whatever.

752
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
 And it was and it was it was still like, OK, so that was pretty cool.

753
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:09,000
 And so I think as long as you are when you're doing something more theatrical, I think you have so much more freedom to age.

754
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
 I'm here with you. Yeah.

755
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:23,000
 And I am more worried about it for my magic career specifically, because once you become an old guy magician, it totally changes the lanes you have to pursue gigs.

756
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:32,000
 Like it is just a different world when you're old. There have been so many amazing old guy magicians, though. I mean, but it takes some like curating.

757
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
 Right. Like people have to kind of like you in the community that they kind of put you on a pedestal.

758
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
 You have to kind of be people's first recommendation.

759
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 Well, maybe if you get in good with some classic magicians, maybe you can find some some guys who have made it made their bones and become friends with them.

760
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you could maybe you could actually deeply befriend one of the greatest magicians to ever live in the history of the planet.

761
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 That might set you up for success. I'm not guaranteeing it.

762
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
 I'm not. I've had Hondros in stuff. All right. Well, let's go. Let's talk.

763
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
 So let's get Hondro on on the foreign and see if we can get you in the pocket with him good, because that might make things a little bit smoother.

764
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
 Like my my my joke is that my my magic career has been that of a foreign star.

765
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:25,000
 I've gone from babysitter to MILF like instantly. And and and it's and it's and it's and it's difficult.

766
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
 You know, like the key to having it is difficult to go to MILF.

767
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 That's if I were probably don't never go ask the MILF if I was if I was if I was five or maybe 10 years older than I am right now, I would not be on the gig I'm doing right now.

768
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
 I'm telling you that right now I would not be hired for what I'm doing.

769
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
 You know, you would not be on the gate because they wouldn't hire you, not because you wouldn't do it.

770
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 But correct. Yeah. Right. But Matt, now that you are and you're gaining the experience of it and you're getting into that system somewhat,

771
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
 do you feel with some degree of confidence in 10 years should things be where they are?

772
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
 You could then book that gig because of the experience you're getting now.

773
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:13,000
 I think a really good example of someone's doing something that I would probably love doing is this guy named Sean Farquhar out of Vancouver.

774
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,000
 Sean was the first one of the one of the first people to fool Penn and Teller on Fool Us.

775
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
 He forever was a cruise ship warhorse and just and private gig guy and just did everything all over the world.

776
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
 He's won all these awards for being master magician and that kind of stuff like that.

777
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:36,000
 He's one of one of the most respected magicians out there. He's very funny, very funny.

778
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
 And he now runs his own magic theater in Vancouver that has like 40 seats.

779
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
 It's in like a speakeasy. You have to like find it in this like old antique shop. That's where I've heard that name before.

780
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 Yeah. Yeah. His speakeasy there is a big deal. Yeah.

781
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
 And so he got off the road and now he runs shows every Friday and Saturday and he sells out.

782
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
 He adds another show and he does so he does like sometimes two, sometimes four, sometimes six shows a weekend.

783
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
 And and the math just makes sense for what people pay to go see him do his thing.

784
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
 But he has enough of a reputation as like as like a fantastic magician to do that.

785
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 And so that is definitely like a trajectory. And he's older, not not that much older, but he's a little older.

786
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 And so like that to me is an example of like a trajectory I could try to follow or ape or whatever.

787
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:35,000
 Yeah. Cool. The chat is going crazy right now. They're just doing different MILF things and making Magician the Ilm.

788
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
 And there's just all kinds of different things coming up in the chat right now. It's really pretty funny.

789
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:51,000
 My favorite so far is from Rich Milb, magician. I'd like to book the magician. I'd like the Milb chaotic clumsy magician.

790
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:03,000
 I'd like to feed the reasonable plan because I don't know if you've heard, but speakeasies might become a thing in Vegas, Matt.

791
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
 Well, that's a U.S. about side effects of changing times.

792
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,000
 I mean, yeah, right. The entertainment industry as we know it, the mainstream entertainment industry as we know it is dying.

793
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
 And so that is that is a but here's the thing.

794
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
 That's exactly like that's the only way I could work in Vegas right now.

795
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,000
 Like my dream is to work in Vegas and be home with my children more, maybe even like a coach of soccer or basketball team or something like that.

796
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,000
 And I and I can't write and I'll never gain the notoriety it takes to launch a show on the strip.

797
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
 And that could because launching a show on the strip means millions of dollars no matter what.

798
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,000
 Yeah. So even if someone to give me a million dollars today, I could in good faith be like, yeah, we can figure it out, you know.

799
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:52,000
 But if there is a venue like a speakeasy that hires multiple entertainers and the reputation for the speakeasy is like, you got to come here and have an awesome time.

800
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
 And I just happen to be someone who's part of that awesome time.

801
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
 Like, that's the way I could work in Vegas. And if that happened tomorrow, I would do it tomorrow.

802
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
 Yeah. Well, I think there's hope for that. And I think Celestia, too.

803
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
 You've probably been on the end of this, too. I know for myself, I've had to invent and create spaces to perform throughout my life.

804
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:19,000
 Yeah. Right. It's just, you know, from from the the shows I'm running over at pod duty, just because I went to that space was like, this is a duty.

805
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:29,000
 This is a place to do improv like this is going to work. And it's working, you know, free free classes and whatnot. But it's still it's it's working really well in that little thing.

806
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:40,000
 And like I started a coffee house so I could do improv, you know, and that I think that's the hard part about getting older.

807
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:51,000
 When we were younger, we would create all of our performance situations because we could create a social scene around them. And that's like goes away when you get older is that you can't create a place because everybody's busy.

808
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:02,000
 Yes. And yeah, and tired. Yeah. Well, this is the net. This is my busy and tired. This is my big dream, too, is the future name of Matt and Mattingly busy and tired.

809
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:14,000
 Somehow. And I think like you're talking about, like, you know, with incorporating us, but like, I want like a coffee house, tea house, comic book shop, small theater kind of environment.

810
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:23,000
 But it's all about just trying to trying to grow community. But it just takes a long time to grow community. It just really takes a long time.

811
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
 And I see myself at the bottom of the bottom rung of that ladder again with what I am entering into right now.

812
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:53,000
 And I see I see that fucking ladder and I'm like, God damn it, don't want to climb this shit again. And I do. I do. And I'm going to do it. And and I think magically, some other magical shit will happen.

813
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
 That's always that's always the hardest part about improv is you can't take your resume with you. You always have to start.

814
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
 Yes, it's all starting fresh. Makes sense. Yeah, it's all starting fresh.

815
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:14,000
 You got to prove it. Because even look at Steel City Improv is rolling out the red carpet for you. Right. Right. Yes. Even still, like, their audience doesn't know who you are yet.

816
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:25,000
 Right. So you still have to, like, get that going. Absolutely. It's all new, baby. It's all new. Now it's moving in the right direction. I've got my class sold out. I've got a waiting list now.

817
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:37,000
 Awesome. But the first but the first class didn't sell enough timing wise. So it ain't like, you know, but it's coming. It's coming. It's not it's not instant. It's not. But yeah, it we're building a building a building straight up.

818
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:48,000
 I'm just I'm just excited for the artist in Pittsburgh. Like, it's crazy, like the embarrassment of riches you got with Paul. And so the fact that, like, people are finally catching on makes me so happy because we're going to get there.

819
01:21:48,000 --> 01:22:01,000
 We're going to get there. We're going to make some magic happen with all this shit and with my love of comic books and I was gonna say, but what I oh that the point I wanted to make was that it is in no small part.

820
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:16,000
 Because of this podcast and the wonderful community that I can continue to do this stuff with the degree of enthusiasm that I do coming off of scoop fest and coming here to just start stuff again and to really lock down and teach a free class on stuff.

821
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:28,000
 I am enthused because of what we can create and what this community means to me and how I want to show up for them in the future by continuing to build stuff here too.

822
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:36,000
 So just I can't thank scoops enough for what they provide for me every day. It's yeah can't do it without you guys.

823
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:47,000
 Yep. I'll tell you what else you can't do. You can't win Jack versus third but we're gonna try anyway. Fuck you.

824
01:22:47,000 --> 01:23:07,000
 October 25th. Get the cam get there.

825
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
 When we get the budget.

826
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:19,000
 Hey, I tell you what a basement. So Celestia, will you be our go to lifeline? Sure. I'll hang out and be a lifeline. Yeah, fantastic. Thank you.

827
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:28,000
 And Celestia toss out all that information for the for the skeptic camp. One more time. It will be Saturday, October 25th, 9am to 7pm.

828
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:42,000
 We're gonna have lunch and snacks and even some limited childcare. If you sign up, you must sign up. Register today at LV s o s dot com. And yeah, it's free. You just have to register.

829
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:59,000
 There you go. So go sign up. And we got a scooper. He coming to us today for rum rum raisin Berg. Hey, you face fuckers. Here's a scooper. He all about the fun stuff to do in Las Vegas this weekend instead of attending scoop fest. I kid it now occurs to me that this scooper.

830
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:09,000
 He is being sent very close to serve scoop fest and it probably won't happen before the event takes place. Oh, well fucking with the face rum raisin Berg. You are correct in all of those things.

831
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:19,000
 The categories are shows, sports, food and activities. I'm up first. I'll just go top left shows for 200.

832
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:40,000
 You could see this multi species magic act at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. X Burlesque. Ever since ever since X Burlesque added that chimera, it's shot tickets.

833
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:54,000
 I believe it is piff the magic dragon. Yes, of course. Oh, see, now I was going to go with what's what's the Popovich Gregory Popovich.

834
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:05,000
 Yeah, instead of going piff the magic dragon, you were going to go Greg Popovich. Look, he's the only one that I know of that has the multiple species and more.

835
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:19,000
 He's at Planet Hollywood. More live pussy on stage than X Burlesque. Oh, but how much did should be his should be his catchphrase, by the way, it's his cat's face.

836
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:33,000
 Cat's phrase. Ozzy Robb says RuPaul's dog race. I'd watch that show, too. We missed you at the scoop fest Ozzy Robb. Good to hear from you, pal.

837
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:46,000
 Absolutely. A year from late April, early May, 2027. That's when we're doing the next scoop fest. Yes. Sports, please, for 200.

838
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:58,000
 You can see the Las Vegas Raiders play host to this salmon eating shitting in the woods NFC North team.

839
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:09,000
 Wouldn't it be great if every professional sports team had to live their life like the Mascots?

840
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
 I didn't know. I don't know if paleo CrossFit gym had a football team.

841
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:29,000
 Live and learn. That would be the Vikings. The Vikings is incorrect. It's the Bears. Oh, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot.

842
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:38,000
 Well, there's a Viking shit in the woods. I mean, I think so. I think all those things also apply to Vikings. Sven will never know.

843
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:47,000
 We just said we just had fat bear week. Did you guys see that fat bear week? I did see that because bears are getting fat for the winter.

844
01:26:47,000 --> 01:27:01,000
 You get to vote on them. They've already crowned the winner. The fattest shit that these I just I did see that a lot of a lot of uptick in bears going for people's trash cans to get loaded up for loaded for bear.

845
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:12,000
 They were all just getting ready for hibernation. And so like there were a lot more bears in residential areas just this last week. Yes, this has been your bear report from Ice Cream Social.

846
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:30,000
 Just the bear facts. I will try activities for 600. Oh, yeah. Here we go. You can attend the Zombie Rumble at Area 51 highlighted by live music and a blank show.

847
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:44,000
 I wonder if I bet this was supposed to be area 15. Maybe maybe I think maybe the numbers are transposed. I don't know. I will say I will guess burlesque. Oh, and the burlesque show.

848
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:56,000
 Oh, no, I'm sorry, Paul. It's a classic car show. I mean, that's close. Right. The burlesque of the auto world. Get to see what's under the hood. Yeah, tassels on it.

849
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:08,000
 I'll stick with shows for 400. This is a concert. A tribute to blank at the Orleans Hotel and Casino.

850
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:21,000
 This is terrible. I was texting with someone about this show two days ago. Do you have a clue? I live by the South Point or not. No, the Orleans. I'm confusing myself point with my Orleans here.

851
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:33,000
 Yeah, I messed up a Viking and a bear. So don't feel bad. Is it John Williams? I don't know. A tribute to John Williams. It's not a tribute to John Williams.

852
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:48,000
 Shit, I got to pass, Matt. I don't know. Is it the band? Is it the concert? A tribute to the band? Oh, the band, the band. I haven't been to the Orleans in years.

853
01:28:48,000 --> 01:29:00,000
 Officially there last week. Oh, well, I still don't know. I will. I will have to pass. Wait, I know for a fact that we walked past advertisements for it. I have an answer. The Viking. Oh, go ahead. The Viking.

854
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:19,000
 The Vikings. Here we go. Let's try the Vikings. Oh, it's Abba. Abba. Now I remember Ozzy Robb coming through with it. The worst part about that is I had a long conversation with one of the owners of the show downstairs during Scoop Fest. Oh, shit.

855
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:26,000
 And you forgot that. We ran at each other in front of the in front of the theater. I invited them to come up to Scoop Fest. I don't think they did. Oh, that's too bad.

856
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:39,000
 I was like, oh, yeah, bring the cast. Preferably stay in the Abba costumes. Come on up. Yeah. Yeah. My mind is fucked. Matt, you're up. Sports 400, please.

857
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:48,000
 You can catch the Destructathon, which features battles between blank combatants from around the globe.

858
01:29:48,000 --> 01:30:05,000
 Is it robots? Between robot combatants from around the globe? I mean, that would work. I think that's right. What's robots? All right. Let's try robots. Battle bots fighting robots. That is like my favorite show in Las Vegas.

859
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:22,000
 I've seen it three times. I still haven't seen battle bots live and I really want to. It's amazing. It's the only show in Vegas where they have it like a disclaimer on the marketing that says normally shows run 90 minutes, but occasionally the robots catch fire and that could cause a delay.

860
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:36,000
 It happens. I'll try activities for 800. Get some points back on the board. Daily double. Perfect. I'm dead.

861
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:52,000
 You could dance the night away at this nightclub, which won best nightclub in Las Vegas is weekly to 2025 best of Las Vegas. Oh God.

862
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:09,000
 Is it Drays? Jacobs Whiskey Pit. Is it Drays? The real winner. Nice one, Jordan. We know what the real winner was. There's Drays. Do you have any ideas, Celestia? What other nightclubs are out there now? It's not Drays. They just closed.

863
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:29,000
 Okay, that saves me. I'm thinking Tau or Omni. Oh, right. Omni. I think it's Tau. I think Tau is coming back with a vengeance. I'll go with Tau. Okay, I'll try Tau. It's Zuke. Those are like the driverless taxi cabs.

864
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:44,000
 Yeah, it's kind of like that. What the hell is Zuke? I think that's the club at Resorts World. Oh, for fuck's sake. Doesn't Josh Gad run that? It's called Gad Zukes. Is that it? That makes sense. That makes sense.

865
01:31:44,000 --> 01:32:04,000
 That's probably it. Gad Zukes. I'll go back to shows for $600. You can go see Magic Mike Live at this Las Vegas casino. While it used to be at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which is now the Virgin, it is currently at the Sahara.

866
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:19,000
 Used to be SLS and now Sahara. Yeah, it was Sahara, then it was SLS, now it's Sahara again. I don't know why. Matt, you're up. Show is $800.

867
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:37,000
 You can see this Grammy Award nominated artist known for doing backflips at T-Mobile Arena. Who's known for doing backflips? You saw the show, Matt. I think. At T-Mobile?

868
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:51,000
 I think this might have been a one night only concert type thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh really? I don't think this was a repeating show. Oh, Celestia knows. I'll go to Celestia.

869
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:10,000
 It's that Benson kid. Somebody Benson. He's like, don't you beautiful, beautiful thing. Okay, I'm terrible at singing it, but you'll know the song when you hear it. Robbie Benson? No. His last name is Benson.

870
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:26,000
 And that's all you need for Jeopardy. Who is Benson? I thought it was Pink. Are we going with just Benson? Can we just say Benson? Benson Honeydew from the Muppets. Try it. Is Benson enough for you to get as the Arbiter?

871
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:37,000
 Benson Boone. Oh shoot, it was his first name, not his last name. Oh shoot. That's alright. Benson Boone. Paul, Paul, be the Arbiter. Yes or no? Yes, because we got Benson.

872
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:48,000
 All right, got Benson. Also, we would have also accepted Rene Aberjong-Wong. Who was on Benson, yes. That's precisely why we would have accepted it.

873
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:57,000
 Paul, you're up. I will go. Matt, great job on that question, buddy. I'll go Food for 800. Let's get some points back on the board.

874
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:12,000
 According to BoydGaming.com, these are the two open 24-hour dining options available to ScoopFest attendees at the Orleans Hotel and Casino.

875
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:20,000
 What are the two 24-hour options at the old Orleans? I tell you, it ain't fucking Ballywick. I'll tell you that much right now.

876
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:33,000
 Ballywick is open for roughly 42 minutes a day. Mike and Lori's suite. That's it. That's it. That's pretty much the only option. Fuck, man. I have to pass. I don't know.

877
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:40,000
 I've never been to the Elsroth suite. Nor have I. Isn't that funny? It's just Jacob. That makes sense that it's just Jacob.

878
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:50,000
 It's just Jacob. And I don't hang out. I just go in and have a drink. I mean, I think the diner that I ate at in the Orleans.

879
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:59,000
 Chaotic Road Ice Cream and Dale Jizz.

880
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:06,000
 One of those things does last. Jizz, mate. Jizz, mate. Jizz, mate.

881
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:13,000
 I think the diner is open 24 hours, but I don't know what the diner is called.

882
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
 I'll accept diner if you can get the other one. Oh, OK.

883
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:28,000
 Then I think TGI Fridays. 24/7 TGI Fridays? I kind of think it is. I'll say the diner and TGI Fridays.

884
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:36,000
 Nope. Sbarro and Fuddruckers. Holy shit. I ate a piece of Sbarro pizza while I was there.

885
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:46,000
 That could have been sitting there for 24 hours. It could have been. Those are the two funniest names for any food establishments.

886
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,000
 It is true. Fuddruckers is hard to beat. Is Fuddruckers the one where they make fun of you?

887
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:00,000
 No, that's Dick's last resort. Oh, that's right. Yeah. I think also that Fridays is closed. It was not even there during Scoot Fest.

888
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
 Was it gone? Oh, yeah. I mean, there was a facade still there, right? But, Matt, is it closed 24/7?

889
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:15,000
 That's what could have confused me. It is indeed closed 24/7. It's not open 24. Oh, it's closed 24/7. OK, now I...

890
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
 Ozzy Robb says both of those phrases are Mormon swear words. You're right.

891
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
 Oh, Fuddruckers. Well, Sbarro. Let's see. Score check. Matt is winning with a thousand points.

892
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:33,000
 I'm in second with zero points. Paul's in third with negative 14 points. We got one daily double left on the board.

893
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:40,000
 Let's see. I'll try food for... No, fuck it. I'm going sports for 800.

894
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
 You can see all of the high-flying action of this small independent wrestling federation at the Nerd Bar.

895
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:57,000
 Oh, shit. I know this one because I've been trying to get people to go with me to see this for weeks on the rare occasions that I'm actually available to go to it.

896
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:11,000
 It is called Micromania. Micromania midget wrestling. Their words, not mine. Wow. OK. Matt, you're up.

897
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,000
 I'll do food for 200. You guys remember Micro Machines? Now I'm just thinking about Micromania. Oh, yeah. I love Micromania.

898
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
 It's like I can talk really, really fast. Well, you can combine the wrestling with the BattleBots. You've got Microbots.

899
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:32,000
 Take it, but it's Chick-fil-A. We can just move on. You get a chicken sandwich.

900
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:43,000
 It's from this chain in Caesar's Palace Forum Food Hall, just not on Sunday. What? Chick-fil-A. Just click it and say Chick-fil-A. It's Chick-fil-A.

901
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:49,000
 The part of that that's confusing to me is I don't know where Chick-fil-A is in the Caesar's Palace Forum Food Hall.

902
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
 Neither do I. I just said not on Sunday and know it's Chick-fil-A. That's it. You're like, "Church on Sunday. Fuck you."

903
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
 I work in Caesar's Palace. I didn't know there was a Chick-fil-A. Paul, you're up.

904
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:10,000
 I will take food for $600, please. By the way, I'm fine with that. I don't need Chick-fil-A. Let's get some points on the board. Here we go.

905
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:20,000
 You can stuff your face at this buffet, which won the best buffet on Las Vegas' Weekly's 2025 Best of Las Vegas.

906
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:39,000
 The Caesar's World Buffet? What's it called? Oh! Becca Boonch or Meet Yourself. The Forum Buffet? The Forum? No. What's it called?

907
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
 You want me to tag in? That is the entire question. I can tell you. Oh, yes, please. Celestia, help him.

908
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:53,000
 It is The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's. And it's either that one or the Wicked Spoon at Cosmo. It's always a battle between those two.

909
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:00,000
 Oh, Celestia, throwing shade at the Wynn Buffet. Which do you think was the winner this last time, Celestia?

910
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:07,000
 Well, I think it's going to be Caesar's. Right. Telling Bellagio's Buffet to fuck right off. Celestia Ward.

911
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,000
 I know my fucking buffets. Have you met me? I love The Bacchanal. Yeah, The Bacchanal is fucking good.

912
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
 The Bellagio Buffet is endless water from their fountains. You can just. That's right. Oh, God.

913
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
 And they've got the chocolate fountain there, too, but you're not allowed to touch it.

914
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:31,000
 Did you see they put a boat in the fountain this morning? There's now a boat. It looks so weird. It's so stupid.

915
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:37,000
 It just makes it makes the fountains look less impressive to stick this big like fairy.

916
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,000
 Because now you realize that it's not that big. Yes. Do they put people on it? Is that what it is?

917
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
 They just get more money on people? I guess. I don't know what they're doing with it. They literally just put it in the water this morning.

918
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
 Is it for the F1 stunt? Is it just for F1 or are we going to have to deal with that all the time? Probably.

919
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:58,000
 I think it's there as part of the new Carbone restaurant that just opened there. I think it's a stunt from them.

920
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:05,000
 Really? I think it's there like going forward. Do you think that they I bet they will have people you can pay to go out into the middle.

921
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
 Oh, yeah. And they had some captain on the front of the boat like he was steering this ship. He looked embarrassed.

922
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:19,000
 It's a living. Oh, is there law of the sea? Yeah. International waters. International waters, baby.

923
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:30,000
 Law of the sea. International gray water. Also gross. If you're in that gray water, you're in that place getting squirted on by old laundry detergent, right?

924
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:37,000
 That is true. Yeah. No, thanks. I don't know if I want to get on that boat. What's it? When you talk to me out of it, the maiden of the mist.

925
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:47,000
 This would be the maiden of the pissed. Yeah. Oh, they are not going to be happy with us.

926
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:53,000
 Which buffet won Las Vegas. We went with the Bacchanal Bacchanal Bacchanal is your answer.

927
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:02,000
 OK, let's see. I'm sorry. It is the wind. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's all right. Jacob tried to help you.

928
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
 Did you know about the wind buffets that is overpriced? It's good, though.

929
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:13,000
 Well, yes, I tried to help you for trying. Chris Angel invented the buffet.

930
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
 That's right. And I staffed it with all homeless people. They had nothing when I met them.

931
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
 They had nothing. They didn't even know how to cook. I taught them how to cook. I taught them how to be there.

932
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,000
 And now, thank God, you know, who here likes food? Let's hear it for food. Everybody stand up for food.

933
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,000
 Everybody stand up. Thank you. That's my show. Thank you. Let's hear it again.

934
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:44,000
 I'm not going to sit back down before I leave. I guess I'll just stay standing. I have a Chris Angel little person dwarf story that I forgot to tell.

935
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:50,000
 Wait a minute. I'll have to tell it to you next time. OK, that's a teaser.

936
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
 That's a hot tease. I'm going sports for six hundred.

937
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:59,000
 You can watch the Las Vegas Aces compete against this team in the semifinals of the 2025 WNBA playoffs.

938
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
 You would have to watch it on TV as the game is in a different city.

939
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,000
 I think that's the Mystics. I think they were playing the Mystics. I'll go Mystics.

940
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
 Now it's the Fever. Indiana Fever. You give me fever.

941
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
 Indiana. Fever in the corn at night. Fever.

942
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
 Indiana. Food 400. What an awful place to live.

943
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:38,000
 You get to eat at this iconic 24 hour American restaurant known for its large portions and neon retro interior founded in 1972 on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip.

944
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
 Oh, shoot. You know this one. Yeah, it's a wonderful place.

945
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
 Go ahead, Celestia. Help me out.

946
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
 It is the pepper mill. Oh, right.

947
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:59,000
 I was thinking about the other place that had the tractor and the thing and the tractor. Oh, the old red hash house.

948
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
 Hasn't been around since '72. Yeah, I know.

949
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,000
 That's why I was hesitating and asked for Celestia's help, Paul.

950
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
 Good move. Paul, you got activities for 200 or 400.

951
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,000
 You are, let's see, three thousand six hundred points behind Matt.

952
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:21,000
 Eighteen hundred points behind me. Let's take 400, get some points on the board. There you go. Get some points on the board, baby.

953
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:29,000
 You can catch Tomorrowland's event Unity at this iconic Las Vegas venue.

954
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
 Oh. Oh. Unity.

955
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:40,000
 It's got to be Sphere. Maybe. Let's try it.

956
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:48,000
 It's the Sphere. Oh, so that's interesting. So Disney is using some of their ride stuff in the Sphere.

957
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
 Like, did you guys ever go on Spaceship Earth? Not Spaceship Earth. What was the alien encounter?

958
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:59,000
 What was the one, remember that Disney ride where you sat on, it was like you were in a rocket ship and you went up into space.

959
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
 Do you remember that? It was a giant theater that turned into a rocket ship, basically.

960
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
 Oh, I don't remember. Captain EO?

961
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
 No, it's not Captain EO. Chat, anybody know what I'm talking about?

962
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
 Not Small World. No, you got in the Mission Earth maybe.

963
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
 Yeah, I guess it was at Epcot. It's not Spaceship Earth. It's not the-

964
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
 Was it the thing where they spun you around and it felt like you were on the Gravitron?

965
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
 No, but there was a shake to the seats when it took off.

966
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
 I'm closing out the category as the game activities for 200.

967
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:35,000
 You can celebrate the 40th anniversary of this time traveling 80s movie at the Composer's Room.

968
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
 It might have been Mission to Mars.

969
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
 Was it Captain EO?

970
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
 Yeah, it's Captain EO. Yep.

971
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
 It's Space Mountain. Space Mountain final answer.

972
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
 Back to the Future.

973
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
 Yes, I know it's Back to the Future. I'm still naming Disney things.

974
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
 Oh, okay. Okay, Dark Cauldron.

975
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
 Dark Cauldron.

976
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:05,000
 That is the game Black Winds with 1600 points. I'm in second place with 400 points. Close game today.

977
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
 Paul is in third with -1600 points.

978
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
 And that's the Scooperty for today. It's from Rum Raisenberg. Thank you Rum Raisenberg.

979
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
 If you want to send us a Scooperty or a Price is Skryte Jock vs. Nerd or an Obelisk Jock vs. Nerd,

980
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
 head over to HayScoops.com. Right there on the homepage you can do all those things.

981
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
 You can also send us some Scoop Mail. Do all those things right over there at HayScoops.com.

982
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
 Oh, Matt is so distraught over losing. He's going to jump off the edge of a boat. Don't do it, Matt.

983
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
 He won. He won.

984
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
 I'm so distraught over winning. I'm going to jump over the edge of the boat.

985
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
 Either way, he's not used to it.

986
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
 Don't do it, Matt. You won.

987
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,000
 I just want to show Ryre how he said, should I piss off my balcony? I want to show him what would happen if I pissed off my balcony.

988
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
 Just ride onto a lifeboat.

989
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
 Go right back into your face.

990
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
 On someone's head.

991
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:59,000
 What deck are you on? You're pretty close to the water level.

992
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:05,000
 I am. I asked to be just underwater so I could really crack the door.

993
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
 Give everybody a shot of the ocean real quick.

994
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
 Look at that.

995
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
 Somewhere over there is Canada.

996
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
 Law of the Sea. How glorious.

997
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
 Matt is just standing there not restrained by any international law.

998
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
 Nice.

999
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
 It's beautiful.

1000
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
 He just murdered someone right on camera. It doesn't matter. Law of the Sea.

1001
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
 Beautiful out there.

1002
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:37,000
 We're probably going to do another episode, but it's my first time on Virgin Voyages, and obviously, this is totally up above.

1003
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
 It's pretty nice.

1004
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
 Yeah, this is nuts.

1005
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
 Yeah, it's pretty swanky.

1006
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,000
 I'm not having as good a day as Paul, but it's really nice.

1007
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
 I have to thank people, yeah?

1008
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
 I would just thank people in general. We don't have new lists yet. It's a new month.

1009
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
 I'll give some personal thanks.

1010
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
 Thank you. This is a guy who gave me an excellent Americano.

1011
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
 Thank you to him.

1012
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
 Good.

1013
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,000
 I want to thank everybody who supports us over on Patreon. If we didn't have Patreon, this podcast would not be killing it.

1014
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
 It's been killing it now for almost 11, was it 12 years? I lose track.

1015
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
 12?

1016
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
 More than a decade.

1017
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:16,000
 And that happens because people want us to exist, and we're not a podcast that relies on hot takery.

1018
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:26,000
 We don't try to do sizzling things to go viral. We just try to joke around and keep people's days a little more amusing than they would be otherwise.

1019
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
 And if you think that's a cool mission, then go ahead and support us today over at preachingfun.com.

1020
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:55,000
 Or if you believe the opposite, if you believe the opposite of everything Matt just said, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1021
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:08,000
 That's right, fartsinabag.biz, that along with preachingfun.com.

1022
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:15,000
 It takes you over to our Patreon page, where for as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air if you think it's worth more than $0.

1023
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
 Preachingfun.com, fartsinabag.biz, those are your destinations.

1024
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
 Keep this show rocking and rolling for another 12 years.

1025
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
 We'll do it if you want us to.

1026
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
 I guess that's about it.

1027
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
 Yep, I want to do this for another 12 years. I seriously do.

1028
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
 I really, really do.

1029
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
 Then we can go back and listen to this episode of how we thought we'd be when we were older.

1030
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
 And then when I leave up here...

1031
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
 Then I can remember when I had a functioning left eye.

1032
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
 You'll be there in an eye patch, and I'll be there showing everyone my new tattoo with a chicken with a rope around his neck.

1033
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
 Guys, I've got this great new bit!

1034
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
 Huge thanks to our guest, Celestia Ward.

1035
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
 Thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

1036
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
 The most patient guest we've ever had.

1037
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
 Yes, thank you for indulging my bullshit, but this was my best day ever. I had to share it.

1038
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
 I was blipping out a couple times. Zoom hated me for some reason today.

1039
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
 If Paul loses an eye, I'll have my Patreon.

1040
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
 Oh, you're doing great.

1041
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
 Never affected the episode, so it's all good.

1042
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:19,000
 We will definitely share your information for SkeptiCamp on our socials and spread the word.

1043
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:26,000
 And please, Scoops, help spread the word, especially if you're in Vegas, know people in Vegas, or just know some skeptics who might go,

1044
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
 "Hey, fuck it, I'll go get free lunch in Vegas for a weekend. Let's do this shit."

1045
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
 Free lunch and critical thinking, yeah.

1046
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
 Yeah, yeah, that's a pretty great combo.

1047
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
 Oh, I'm so good at one of those things.

1048
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:44,000
 Help us, help Celestia spread the word on SkeptiCamp. It's a positive thing for the planet and America for sure.

1049
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
 Yeah.

1050
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
 So, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Celestia.

1051
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:53,000
 And Paul, you've got to ask Fact Check Andy about his eye. He had a retina detachment scare.

1052
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
 Oh, I know. We've been through it. We talked through it.

1053
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:05,000
 That was one of several hundreds of things that have kept Crispapus2 from getting done. It's almost done. It's technically done.

1054
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
 But that was one of the-

1055
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
 Christmas is coming!

1056
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
 Huh?

1057
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
 Christmas is coming already, yes.

1058
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:18,000
 Christmas? Oh, no, but it's- oh, Christmas is- forget it. If we could get Crispapus2 by Easter-

1059
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
 Christmas 27.

1060
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:25,000
 Because the Easter Bunny is a big part of the show- is a big part of the story, that'd be perfect. I don't know if we're going to be able to get there.

1061
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
 I've got to see what Andy's up to, but we're close. We're getting closer and closer. We may need to call on you again.

1062
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
 Can we put no work demands on Andy's plate right now?

1063
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:40,000
 Exactly, because he's- well, no, he's working now. He's doing caricatures right now, but he's had a fucking rough year of it.

1064
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
 Yeah.

1065
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:51,000
 And Andy, I love you the most, buddy. You're my art hero. I adore you. You're my book partner. We'll get the book done when we get it done.

1066
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:57,000
 But, Celestia, while you're here, at some point we may call upon you for your editorial skills on old Crispapus2 as well.

1067
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
 My pleasure.
