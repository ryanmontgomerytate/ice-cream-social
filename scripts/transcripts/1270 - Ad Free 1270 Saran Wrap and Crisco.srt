1
0:00:03 --> 0:00:10
Oh, hello there! I am so happy you're here because right now I'd like to thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

2
0:00:10 --> 0:00:14
Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers! I don't have a list yet. We're recording this show in the past,

3
0:00:15 --> 0:00:18
but we are going to thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver before this month is over.

4
0:00:19 --> 0:00:23

0:00:27 --> 0:00:30

7
0:00:30 --> 0:00:37
The life you save may be your own. Here's the show!

8
0:00:38 --> 0:00:41
Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

9
0:00:42 --> 0:00:43
Yeah, I'd love to!

10
0:00:43 --> 0:00:44
Great! Let's go!

11
0:00:51 --> 0:00:57
Horses! Reportedly did not come to the Las Vegas rodeo this year because of a horse flu.

12
0:00:57 --> 0:00:59
No, I know horse whoopies!

13
0:00:59 --> 0:01:00
Oh, really?

14
0:01:03 --> 0:01:07
It's Cream Social! Sittin' in Las Vegas! That's Matt Donnelly! Sittin' in Pittsburgh!

15
0:01:07 --> 0:01:13
It's Paul Mattingly! Sittin' in Las Vegas! Loaded with horse herpes! It's me, Jacob, the audio guy!

16
0:01:13 --> 0:01:14
We're preaching fun.

17
0:01:14 --> 0:01:17
First off, I didn't, because of the music that went into it, but bam-a-lam.

18
0:01:19 --> 0:01:20
Horse herpes, bam-a-lam.

19
0:01:21 --> 0:01:26
Bam-a-lam. If you type in horse herpes, Google will autofill Las Vegas.

20
0:01:27 --> 0:01:27
Oh, shit!

21
0:01:28 --> 0:01:29
Yeah, wait a minute.

22
0:01:29 --> 0:01:31
If you type in herpes at all, Google will autofill Las Vegas.

23
0:01:31 --> 0:01:36
Can they get this by like sharing a water trough and shit? Is that how bad it could be?

24
0:01:36 --> 0:01:37
Is that how viral it is?

25
0:01:38 --> 0:01:39
Where's Nick Newman when we need him?

26
0:01:40 --> 0:01:43
Oh, I was looking for him in the chat before we started.

27
0:01:43 --> 0:01:44
I know. He's not in here.

28
0:01:44 --> 0:01:50
Let's see. No confirmed cases were reported in Nevada, but there is a significant equine

29
0:01:50 --> 0:01:56
herpes virus outbreak affecting horse events nationwide, causing major disruptions, cancellations,

30
0:01:57 --> 0:02:05
like the all-in barrel race, and heightened biosecurity at the NFR rodeo,

31
0:02:05 --> 0:02:07
which is the one in Vegas here during early December.

32
0:02:08 --> 0:02:11
See, a lot of people just didn't bring their horses.

33
0:02:11 --> 0:02:14
A lot of people just left their animals at home and came to the rodeo.

34
0:02:14 --> 0:02:16
Apparently, the rodeo was really affected by it.

35
0:02:17 --> 0:02:20
Paul says, Paul is right. Let's do it.

36
0:02:21 --> 0:02:22
Okay.

37
0:02:22 --> 0:02:26
Primarily directed through contact, nose to nose, or indirectly from shared items like

38
0:02:26 --> 0:02:33
tack, buckets, clothing, and even people's hands, the aerosol droplets,

39
0:02:33 --> 0:02:34
or contact infected with fluids.

40
0:02:35 --> 0:02:36
Man, it's amazing how we all don't have horse herpes.

41
0:02:37 --> 0:02:37
This is everything.

42
0:02:39 --> 0:02:42
I'm already looking up if it can go to people.

43
0:02:42 --> 0:02:44
No, it's not a zoonotic jumper.

44
0:02:44 --> 0:02:45
Please, fuck, no.

45
0:02:47 --> 0:02:49
I don't want horse herpes.

46
0:02:50 --> 0:02:54
No, humans cannot get infected with horse herpes.

47
0:02:54 --> 0:02:55
Don't worry about it.

48
0:02:56 --> 0:02:57
Keep on fucking those horses.

49
0:02:58 --> 0:03:00
Keep on a horse of fucking.

50
0:03:00 --> 0:03:01
Use a step stool.

51
0:03:02 --> 0:03:03
Safety first, people.

52
0:03:03 --> 0:03:04
Safety first.

53
0:03:04 --> 0:03:04
That's right.

54
0:03:04 --> 0:03:06
Oh, good Lord.

55
0:03:06 --> 0:03:08
Don't just be out there puffing it.

56
0:03:08 --> 0:03:10
Mr. Hands has nothing to worry about.

57
0:03:11 --> 0:03:17
There'll be more horse herpy stuff in the new Taylor Sheridan show about the rodeo.

58
0:03:19 --> 0:03:20
Rodeo.

59
0:03:20 --> 0:03:21
What will it be called?

60
0:03:21 --> 0:03:21
Thornton.

61
0:03:22 --> 0:03:23
It'll be called.

62
0:03:23 --> 0:03:26
It'll be called bull rider.

63
0:03:27 --> 0:03:28
Long dick man.

64
0:03:32 --> 0:03:33
Speech guy.

65
0:03:34 --> 0:03:35
Sheridan's running out of good names.

66
0:03:36 --> 0:03:38
Bull rider, long dick man, speech guy.

67
0:03:38 --> 0:03:42
You know what to say about riding bulls?

68
0:03:43 --> 0:03:44
What's that?

69
0:03:44 --> 0:03:47
A lot of times people think it's all about those eight seconds.

70
0:03:47 --> 0:03:48
You got to stay on the bull.

71
0:03:49 --> 0:03:54
Those eight seconds, those are the least important seconds of the whole thing.

72
0:03:54 --> 0:03:58
The most important time is when you enter the pen.

73
0:03:59 --> 0:04:04
My secret, give that bull a little light touch behind the ear.

74
0:04:05 --> 0:04:10
I got a little dab of hot, icy cold on my finger.

75
0:04:11 --> 0:04:14
And I give him a little rub right behind the ear with icy cold.

76
0:04:15 --> 0:04:16
Icy hot.

77
0:04:17 --> 0:04:18
And that's what he's feeling.

78
0:04:18 --> 0:04:18
What are you quoting?

79
0:04:19 --> 0:04:19
What are you quoting?

80
0:04:19 --> 0:04:25
I'm making up a dumb speech that he would do for this rodeo long dick man.

81
0:04:25 --> 0:04:27
I thought you were quoting something, but you're doing it.

82
0:04:27 --> 0:04:30
Oh, I'm improvising, Matt.

83
0:04:30 --> 0:04:30
That's what I do.

84
0:04:30 --> 0:04:31
No, no, no.

85
0:04:32 --> 0:04:34
I didn't mean to be that much of a dick about it.

86
0:04:38 --> 0:04:40
But you didn't make me feel liberal guilt.

87
0:04:40 --> 0:04:41
That's why I didn't think it was a Sheridan speech.

88
0:04:42 --> 0:04:42
You have to.

89
0:04:42 --> 0:04:43
I haven't got there yet.

90
0:04:46 --> 0:04:49
Also, to be fair, I don't, I don't watch.

91
0:04:49 --> 0:04:50
You don't watch the shows.

92
0:04:50 --> 0:04:53
So I don't know enough of, but okay.

93
0:04:53 --> 0:04:54
So now I know where to go to go with it.

94
0:04:55 --> 0:04:55
Yes.

95
0:04:55 --> 0:04:57
So I rub a little bit behind there.

96
0:04:57 --> 0:05:01
And then when that bull knocks me off after eight seconds,

97
0:05:01 --> 0:05:03
if I stay on there for more than eight seconds,

98
0:05:04 --> 0:05:05
that bull has outlived its life.

99
0:05:05 --> 0:05:11
And that bull is going to become your case of fajita over at Chili's next week.

100
0:05:11 --> 0:05:15
But you can't look at that bull and realize that's my case of fajita coming to me.

101
0:05:16 --> 0:05:17
You look at that bull thing.

102
0:05:17 --> 0:05:19
What a noble, beautiful animal.

103
0:05:19 --> 0:05:25
And all I see is the 999 dinner for two special at Chili's.

104
0:05:26 --> 0:05:28
You fucking libtard.

105
0:05:31 --> 0:05:33
Enter Sheridan check out.

106
0:05:34 --> 0:05:35
Is that closer?

107
0:05:35 --> 0:05:36
Is that more like what he says?

108
0:05:36 --> 0:05:36
It's pretty close.

109
0:05:37 --> 0:05:37
It's pretty close.

110
0:05:37 --> 0:05:37
That's much closer.

111
0:05:38 --> 0:05:39
What a dick.

112
0:05:39 --> 0:05:40
I never want to watch any of those shows.

113
0:05:41 --> 0:05:42
You would hate them, Paul.

114
0:05:43 --> 0:05:43
I know I would.

115
0:05:43 --> 0:05:45
I can tell I would.

116
0:05:45 --> 0:05:46
I'm sure.

117
0:05:46 --> 0:05:46
You would hate them.

118
0:05:48 --> 0:05:50
I know there was a thing.

119
0:05:50 --> 0:05:51
It was a yellow stone.

120
0:05:51 --> 0:05:52
Like last year, the yellow stone,

121
0:05:52 --> 0:05:55
there was this character that appeared like a hippie who got arrested.

122
0:05:55 --> 0:06:01
Became like a like a girlfriend of Kevin Costner,

123
0:06:01 --> 0:06:04
but like in this like pseudo we don't like each other,

124
0:06:04 --> 0:06:05
but we do kind of thing.

125
0:06:05 --> 0:06:07
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

126
0:06:07 --> 0:06:11
And her job the last season was just to get lectured by every cast member

127
0:06:11 --> 0:06:13
of a different aspect of Montana society.

128
0:06:15 --> 0:06:16
It's a good gig if you can get it.

129
0:06:16 --> 0:06:19
And at one point, there's one character who's a Native American

130
0:06:19 --> 0:06:22
who's already was already feeling guilt about marrying into a Montana family

131
0:06:22 --> 0:06:23
that like, you know, it's against her.

132
0:06:23 --> 0:06:27
Native American, you know, whatever she lectured her and I was like Jesus.

133
0:06:28 --> 0:06:29
I was like everyone's breaking character.

134
0:06:30 --> 0:06:35
Just a lecture lives like everybody hates this girl once we torch this live girl.

135
0:06:35 --> 0:06:37
We can go back to fighting about real things between our cultures.

136
0:06:37 --> 0:06:40
But in the meantime, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

137
0:06:42 --> 0:06:45
And there was a plot point happening in landmine right now.

138
0:06:45 --> 0:06:49
And I and I and I feel crazy only because like in season one.

139
0:06:49 --> 0:06:51
This person got a payout from the oil company.

140
0:06:51 --> 0:06:55
Like a wrongful death suit. Okay, this couple, this whole season, this whole

141
0:06:55 --> 0:06:58
season, they're fighting over money and I'm like, weren't you paid a shit little

142
0:06:58 --> 0:07:01
money from an old company? Why isn't that coming up in conversation?

143
0:07:01 --> 0:07:02
Why is it coming up?

144
0:07:03 --> 0:07:04
You're paid out.

145
0:07:05 --> 0:07:08
There's a large plot point last season about the large plot point.

146
0:07:09 --> 0:07:12
That's happening right now in Mayor of King's Town, which I watch right now

147
0:07:12 --> 0:07:14
like like the pilot episode is that

148
0:07:17 --> 0:07:19
what's his name? The guy got right over by a snowmower in real life.

149
0:07:21 --> 0:07:23
Hawkeye Hawkeye. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

150
0:07:23 --> 0:07:27
So that guy, he ends up becoming his brother's job because his brother gets

151
0:07:27 --> 0:07:29
killed in a botched robbery, right?

152
0:07:29 --> 0:07:32
And they went through like four seasons were like, man, we haven't brought him

153
0:07:32 --> 0:07:36
up in a while. So the last episode that they bring up is dead brother like six times.

154
0:07:38 --> 0:07:42
So they're really making up for the lost, lost bit there.

155
0:07:42 --> 0:07:45
Jeremy Renner, Jeremy Renner is who I'm thinking of. Yeah.

156
0:07:46 --> 0:07:48
It's hard. It's hard.

157
0:07:49 --> 0:07:51
He's a hard case too. He's a fucking hard case.

158
0:07:51 --> 0:07:53
That guy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

159
0:07:53 --> 0:07:56
You talk about somebody coming away with the wrong life lessons

160
0:07:56 --> 0:07:57
after a near death experience.

161
0:08:00 --> 0:08:04
Jeremy Renner. Yeah. Oh, I don't know about this.

162
0:08:04 --> 0:08:06
Oh, he's just kind of doubled down on his assholery.

163
0:08:06 --> 0:08:07
He's a bit of a shit bird.

164
0:08:08 --> 0:08:13
Okay. I don't know. I like Jeremy Renner a lot.

165
0:08:13 --> 0:08:15
Not a lot. I like Jeremy Renner.

166
0:08:16 --> 0:08:17
I'd fuck him.

167
0:08:17 --> 0:08:18
He's going to break your heart, Matt.

168
0:08:20 --> 0:08:27
It's probably true, but he like survived on like, he and his brother

169
0:08:27 --> 0:08:31
were like split like a box of like donut holes when they were like dirt poor.

170
0:08:32 --> 0:08:37
They got by in Hollywood by like buying and flipping a house and then flipping that

171
0:08:37 --> 0:08:39
in other houses and doing construction, something like that.

172
0:08:39 --> 0:08:42
But like he went from like dirt as poor to like building himself up into

173
0:08:43 --> 0:08:46
like a house flipper while trying to be an actor at the same time.

174
0:08:46 --> 0:08:50
I thought that was pretty cool that he was not any kind of like nepo baby or

175
0:08:50 --> 0:08:52
anything like that. Like he really had to like fight to stay in the business

176
0:08:52 --> 0:08:56
and try to make a go of it. So I do like it and her locker.

177
0:08:56 --> 0:08:59
Come on. That's a cool debut story. Sure.

178
0:08:59 --> 0:09:01
All right. What is why is he a shipper?

179
0:09:01 --> 0:09:04
Ah, it's easy. I get 10 vibes when I hear him talk.

180
0:09:05 --> 0:09:09
Oh, oh, oh, I did something. No, he's just kind of he's just kind of his

181
0:09:09 --> 0:09:11
his his his. Oh, he might not get along with him.

182
0:09:11 --> 0:09:14
I don't give a shit about that. No, no, no, no, no, no.

183
0:09:14 --> 0:09:18
He's take on things. His stance on some shit. It's a little bit.

184
0:09:18 --> 0:09:21
But whatever. It's fine. Paul is weary. Paul is weary.

185
0:09:21 --> 0:09:25
I'm good for him. Good for him. Do your thing. Make your make your money.

186
0:09:26 --> 0:09:30
I went poker the other day for the first time in a very long time.

187
0:09:30 --> 0:09:33
Yeah. And I thought I was going to watch someone get murdered

188
0:09:34 --> 0:09:35
while I was at the poker table.

189
0:09:35 --> 0:09:38
I thought I thought one player was going to murder another player.

190
0:09:38 --> 0:09:39
Tournament or open table?

191
0:09:40 --> 0:09:41
Open table. Okay.

192
0:09:41 --> 0:09:42
Cash game. Okay.

193
0:09:42 --> 0:09:45
No big deal. Low stakes cash game.

194
0:09:45 --> 0:09:48
One three, one three, no limit cash game.

195
0:09:49 --> 0:09:52
Fellow that was at the table a couple of seats down from me.

196
0:09:53 --> 0:09:56
He won a sizable pot from me.

197
0:09:57 --> 0:09:59
Got a little bit lucky on the last card.

198
0:09:59 --> 0:10:01
Drew out on the last card.

199
0:10:01 --> 0:10:03
No, I'm not saying anything to him.

200
0:10:03 --> 0:10:05
You know, I'm the hand ends. He wins.

201
0:10:06 --> 0:10:07
It's a good size to hand.

202
0:10:07 --> 0:10:08
But you're stewing. Yeah, you're stewing.

203
0:10:08 --> 0:10:10
I'm not even stewing.

204
0:10:10 --> 0:10:11
I'm like, oh, that's all right.

205
0:10:11 --> 0:10:12
All right. He got it.

206
0:10:12 --> 0:10:16
He says, without me saying anything, he says to me,

207
0:10:16 --> 0:10:18
boy, I thought you were going to draw out on me there.

208
0:10:20 --> 0:10:21
And I looked, I looked back.

209
0:10:21 --> 0:10:22
I was just confused. I looked back.

210
0:10:22 --> 0:10:24
I was like, wait, I was ahead though.

211
0:10:25 --> 0:10:27
I was ahead until the, until the last card.

212
0:10:27 --> 0:10:29
You got the last card there and you won it.

213
0:10:30 --> 0:10:32
He goes, yeah, yeah, but I was mathematically ahead already.

214
0:10:32 --> 0:10:34
I was supposed to win that hand already.

215
0:10:34 --> 0:10:36
I just wasn't ahead on the cards yet.

216
0:10:37 --> 0:10:38
And I, and I kind of laughed.

217
0:10:39 --> 0:10:42
And I kind of, I kind of, because he was absolutely being genuine.

218
0:10:43 --> 0:10:45
He was, he was saying that with all sincerity.

219
0:10:45 --> 0:10:47
He was like, no, no, no, I was supposed to win that hand.

220
0:10:47 --> 0:10:49
I was ahead mathematically, which he wasn't.

221
0:10:49 --> 0:10:51
By the time he actually made the call,

222
0:10:51 --> 0:10:53
he wasn't mathematically behind when he made the call.

223
0:10:53 --> 0:10:55
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. He won the hand.

224
0:10:55 --> 0:10:56
I wasn't mad about it.

225
0:10:56 --> 0:10:58
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that was, that was that.

226
0:10:58 --> 0:11:02
He was a touch of a, you know, a skosh,

227
0:11:02 --> 0:11:06
this much of a, of just a bit of a jerk about it.

228
0:11:06 --> 0:11:09
Just a, just not even, not even a jerk.

229
0:11:09 --> 0:11:11
I was done with it though.

230
0:11:11 --> 0:11:13
So we, we continue playing the game.

231
0:11:13 --> 0:11:16
I don't say anything to him about it after I got it,

232
0:11:16 --> 0:11:17
after I figured out what he meant by that.

233
0:11:18 --> 0:11:19
Didn't matter that he was wrong.

234
0:11:19 --> 0:11:21
I was over it moving on.

235
0:11:21 --> 0:11:25
So about half an hour later, I win a big hand,

236
0:11:25 --> 0:11:28
a, a, a very big hand off of that guy.

237
0:11:28 --> 0:11:29
Okay.

238
0:11:29 --> 0:11:33
So I made all the money back and then quite a bit more

239
0:11:33 --> 0:11:34
off of that guy.

240
0:11:34 --> 0:11:36
Like I say, about half an hour later.

241
0:11:37 --> 0:11:40
Again, this person is not sitting next to me.

242
0:11:40 --> 0:11:42
There is a person between us.

243
0:11:43 --> 0:11:46
After I win that hand, I don't say anything

244
0:11:46 --> 0:11:48
because I'm not stupid.

245
0:11:48 --> 0:11:51
When it comes to this, I'm not.

246
0:11:51 --> 0:11:52
This scenario, you're not stupid.

247
0:11:52 --> 0:11:55
This scenario, I was not stupid at that moment.

248
0:11:55 --> 0:11:56
There we go.

249
0:11:57 --> 0:11:59
So I don't say a word.

250
0:12:00 --> 0:12:03
The person between us though looks at the guy

251
0:12:03 --> 0:12:04
who just lost the hand.

252
0:12:04 --> 0:12:06
Oh, and by the way, I had drawn out,

253
0:12:06 --> 0:12:08
I had drawn out on this hand.

254
0:12:08 --> 0:12:10
So I got a little bit lucky on this hand.

255
0:12:10 --> 0:12:13
And the fourth card out, I got a little bit lucky

256
0:12:13 --> 0:12:13
with that card.

257
0:12:14 --> 0:12:15
All the more reason to shut up, right?

258
0:12:15 --> 0:12:16
You got lucky.

259
0:12:16 --> 0:12:16
That's it.

260
0:12:16 --> 0:12:16
That's it.

261
0:12:17 --> 0:12:17
Yep.

262
0:12:17 --> 0:12:18
I'm, I'm just being quiet.

263
0:12:18 --> 0:12:20
I'm, I'm stacking up my chips.

264
0:12:20 --> 0:12:21
I'm, I'm moving on to the next hand.

265
0:12:22 --> 0:12:25
The guy between us looks at the guy who just lost

266
0:12:25 --> 0:12:28
and goes, well, that was payback for earlier, huh?

267
0:12:35 --> 0:12:38
And I, like my head just snapped up.

268
0:12:39 --> 0:12:39
You know, I'm looking down.

269
0:12:40 --> 0:12:43
I'm looking anywhere but at this guy, my head just snaps up.

270
0:12:43 --> 0:12:47
And I just, I was like, I, whatever is happening here,

271
0:12:47 --> 0:12:48
I don't want to be a part of this.

272
0:12:50 --> 0:12:53
That's, I would give a, I would give a stern stop helping

273
0:12:54 --> 0:12:56
line to the guy over there.

274
0:12:57 --> 0:13:00
I wanted to, I wanted to so badly.

275
0:13:00 --> 0:13:03
I didn't want to open my mouth though.

276
0:13:03 --> 0:13:06
I was afraid that if I drew any attention to myself,

277
0:13:06 --> 0:13:08
that it was all just going to dump on to me.

278
0:13:09 --> 0:13:12
I've, did a party consider going, right?

279
0:13:12 --> 0:13:13
And then high-fiving the guy.

280
0:13:16 --> 0:13:17
Right.

281
0:13:17 --> 0:13:18
You are.

282
0:13:18 --> 0:13:18
Oh man.

283
0:13:19 --> 0:13:20
Feels good.

284
0:13:20 --> 0:13:21
Don't it, motherfucker?

285
0:13:22 --> 0:13:24
Took the words out of my mouth.

286
0:13:26 --> 0:13:30
He turned to this guy and goes,

287
0:13:31 --> 0:13:33
you need to shut the fuck up.

288
0:13:40 --> 0:13:43
I couldn't hold it together anymore.

289
0:13:43 --> 0:13:44
I burst out laughing.

290
0:13:45 --> 0:13:47
You can just put the mic up and make me laugh really hard.

291
0:13:48 --> 0:13:49
I laughed so hard.

292
0:13:50 --> 0:13:52
I was crying at the poker table.

293
0:13:52 --> 0:13:54
I had to get up and walk away.

294
0:13:55 --> 0:13:56
It was awful.

295
0:13:59 --> 0:14:00
Because that's it.

296
0:14:00 --> 0:14:02
Like you, you have to laugh at that point because

297
0:14:03 --> 0:14:04
that's all you can do.

298
0:14:04 --> 0:14:09
It's all you can do and if that guy is above the laugh line,

299
0:14:09 --> 0:14:11
he's about to get kicked out of the casino anyway.

300
0:14:11 --> 0:14:12
Yes.

301
0:14:12 --> 0:14:12
Yes.

302
0:14:13 --> 0:14:16
So Jake, I just want to make it clear that I'm not involved

303
0:14:16 --> 0:14:18
in whatever this conversation is over here.

304
0:14:18 --> 0:14:20
I think I'm going to go home.

305
0:14:20 --> 0:14:22
I think I'm just going to go home in that kind of scenario.

306
0:14:22 --> 0:14:24
Can you, can you just get up and go?

307
0:14:25 --> 0:14:27
Can you just get up and go after, after any game?

308
0:14:27 --> 0:14:30
After any open table, you can stand up anytime.

309
0:14:30 --> 0:14:33
I feel, don't you feel I have felt bad in the past.

310
0:14:33 --> 0:14:36
I haven't played in forever, but I would feel bad

311
0:14:36 --> 0:14:38
after winning a pot and then leaving the table.

312
0:14:38 --> 0:14:39
It's called hitting and running.

313
0:14:40 --> 0:14:42
You're not, it's bad etiquette.

314
0:14:43 --> 0:14:45
But it's also how you get money, right?

315
0:14:46 --> 0:14:49
It's certainly, it is certainly allowed within the rules

316
0:14:49 --> 0:14:52
and the people who do it are probably more intelligent

317
0:14:52 --> 0:14:54
than the other people who are still sitting at the table.

318
0:14:55 --> 0:14:56
I just stay there to lose.

319
0:14:56 --> 0:14:59
But at least at the DC to take a fake phone call

320
0:14:59 --> 0:15:01
and pretend to talk about an urgent matter.

321
0:15:02 --> 0:15:03
Oh, for God's sakes.

322
0:15:04 --> 0:15:04
Oh my gosh.

323
0:15:05 --> 0:15:05
A baby?

324
0:15:06 --> 0:15:06
Now?

325
0:15:07 --> 0:15:08
Both babies?

326
0:15:08 --> 0:15:10
Both babies at the same time?

327
0:15:11 --> 0:15:12
Wait, more than two?

328
0:15:12 --> 0:15:13
Where are the other babies coming from?

329
0:15:13 --> 0:15:14
How many babies?

330
0:15:15 --> 0:15:16
Guys, I gotta go, sorry, all the babies.

331
0:15:16 --> 0:15:17
Lots of babies.

332
0:15:18 --> 0:15:19
So many babies.

333
0:15:19 --> 0:15:20
So many babies, guys.

334
0:15:20 --> 0:15:24
Hey, great game and you need to shut the fuck up.

335
0:15:24 --> 0:15:24
Bye.

336
0:15:28 --> 0:15:31
I think I stayed for about five more minutes

337
0:15:31 --> 0:15:33
because I didn't know how to not leave awkwardly.

338
0:15:33 --> 0:15:34
Right.

339
0:15:34 --> 0:15:35
And I was like, I'm, this is it.

340
0:15:36 --> 0:15:36
I'm leaving.

341
0:15:36 --> 0:15:37
This is where you're going to.

342
0:15:38 --> 0:15:39
Fuck that.

343
0:15:39 --> 0:15:40
Oh boy.

344
0:15:40 --> 0:15:42
Oh, it was so bad.

345
0:15:42 --> 0:15:43
It was so bad.

346
0:15:43 --> 0:15:44
I was like this, you're going to,

347
0:15:44 --> 0:15:45
you're going to get yourself shot.

348
0:15:46 --> 0:15:48
I'm going to get shot just by sitting here.

349
0:15:48 --> 0:15:49
I don't want to get shot.

350
0:15:49 --> 0:15:50
I don't want to be in a fight

351
0:15:50 --> 0:15:54
with some random dude in a casino at 1130 at night.

352
0:15:54 --> 0:15:56
I've definitely, I've never been sitting at a table

353
0:15:56 --> 0:15:59
where someone hit and run and it's not even

354
0:15:59 --> 0:16:02
like, oh, they're, you know, that lucky motherfucker.

355
0:16:02 --> 0:16:05
It's more like all the money at the table is gone.

356
0:16:05 --> 0:16:07
Like you look at like it's just a bunch of short stacks.

357
0:16:07 --> 0:16:09
You're like, oh, now what are we all playing for $50?

358
0:16:09 --> 0:16:11
Yeah, now the game is just kind of over.

359
0:16:11 --> 0:16:16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still, you know, it's an open table.

360
0:16:16 --> 0:16:20
That's all it's all I would have sat and played for a while longer.

361
0:16:20 --> 0:16:24
If this guy had not egged on the guy that I had just accidentally

362
0:16:25 --> 0:16:25
roughed up.

363
0:16:25 --> 0:16:26
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
0:16:26 --> 0:16:30
The scenario, the amount of scenarios where the table and the other guy

365
0:16:30 --> 0:16:32
was already putting more cash down on the table.

366
0:16:32 --> 0:16:33
Like he was staying in.

367
0:16:33 --> 0:16:33
Yeah.

368
0:16:34 --> 0:16:35
So he wasn't leaving.

369
0:16:35 --> 0:16:36
He wouldn't go anywhere anytime soon.

370
0:16:38 --> 0:16:39
Like, nope, nope.

371
0:16:39 --> 0:16:40
Whatever's happened here.

372
0:16:40 --> 0:16:41
I don't want to be in it.

373
0:16:42 --> 0:16:45
People going on tilts one of the weirdest things to watch

374
0:16:45 --> 0:16:47
and so hard to deal with.

375
0:16:47 --> 0:16:50
And yet, especially at like a low stakes game.

376
0:16:50 --> 0:16:51
Yeah.

377
0:16:51 --> 0:16:54
But this, this is supposed to not matter.

378
0:16:55 --> 0:16:55
Right.

379
0:16:55 --> 0:16:59
This is like on on pot therapy, Whitney's husband, Peter.

380
0:16:59 --> 0:17:01
Yeah, he's a professional poker player.

381
0:17:02 --> 0:17:08
And so we, I always, anytime I play poker, which is probably, I don't know,

382
0:17:08 --> 0:17:13
at this point, three times a year, I go, I'll play poker.

383
0:17:13 --> 0:17:18
And oftentimes I will end up with a story for Peter from these low stakes

384
0:17:18 --> 0:17:21
games because he's these, these one three games aren't the games that he's playing.

385
0:17:21 --> 0:17:28
But every now and then, you run into a professional, you know, a big quote unquote

386
0:17:28 --> 0:17:31
professional poker player at a low stakes game.

387
0:17:31 --> 0:17:33
Well, they all have these training apps now.

388
0:17:34 --> 0:17:39
And they're all like these, there's additional game theory stuff that makes

389
0:17:39 --> 0:17:42
people do dumb things on purpose to mess with other people's math.

390
0:17:43 --> 0:17:44
And no one's playing the cards.

391
0:17:44 --> 0:17:46
And it's gotten super weird.

392
0:17:46 --> 0:17:50
But watching people do that at a low stakes game where no one is doing the

393
0:17:50 --> 0:17:55
math in the first place, yeah, yeah, it's like meta fuck you.

394
0:17:55 --> 0:17:56
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

395
0:17:57 --> 0:17:58
It's, it's crazy.

396
0:17:58 --> 0:18:00
It's just a weird crazy thing.

397
0:18:00 --> 0:18:04
And also, like, you know, and I, I've been, you know, we've all been victims

398
0:18:04 --> 0:18:07
of bad beats, you know, that kind of thing.

399
0:18:09 --> 0:18:14
It's like it's poker for a reason, you know, like, you're like, oh, I was

400
0:18:14 --> 0:18:16
doing the math and then gambling happened.

401
0:18:16 --> 0:18:19
Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of like what we're doing.

402
0:18:20 --> 0:18:24
Yeah, is tempting fate for bouts of luck and craziness.

403
0:18:24 --> 0:18:24
Yeah, right.

404
0:18:24 --> 0:18:27
Sometimes the wrong card just comes out or the right card.

405
0:18:27 --> 0:18:29
Speaking of gambling, go ahead.

406
0:18:29 --> 0:18:36
What are your guys takes on the current state of sports and sort of

407
0:18:36 --> 0:18:37
the veneer cracking around?

408
0:18:38 --> 0:18:43
Oh, that play was clearly somebody covering a spread or fucking around

409
0:18:43 --> 0:18:46
for no good reason, especially the collegiate level.

410
0:18:46 --> 0:18:51
Well, the Raiders got a lot of heat, right?

411
0:18:51 --> 0:18:52
Is there going to be?

412
0:18:52 --> 0:18:54
Is there going to be any kind of real?

413
0:18:54 --> 0:18:56
No, because what consequence?

414
0:18:56 --> 0:18:59
I don't know, but my consequence, like you can't have a consequence.

415
0:18:59 --> 0:19:01
If you don't know that something happened and there's no way to tell

416
0:19:01 --> 0:19:04
if something happened, unless somebody says like I did this.

417
0:19:04 --> 0:19:07
I will say that I hear Paul and that like when they started

418
0:19:07 --> 0:19:11
loosening up all the sports gambling, all the scenarios

419
0:19:11 --> 0:19:13
that everyone thought of sure came up in a hurry.

420
0:19:13 --> 0:19:15
All the things like what if this happens?

421
0:19:15 --> 0:19:16
Where that happens?

422
0:19:16 --> 0:19:18
It seems of all come to a head really quickly.

423
0:19:19 --> 0:19:20
Oh, let me be clear.

424
0:19:21 --> 0:19:22
I don't think I don't think that Paul is wrong on this.

425
0:19:23 --> 0:19:24
I think that Paul is absolutely correct on this.

426
0:19:24 --> 0:19:25
Oh, what's that?

427
0:19:25 --> 0:19:25
I don't know.

428
0:19:26 --> 0:19:27
I think you're absolutely correct on this.

429
0:19:28 --> 0:19:30
I'm saying I don't know how to prove it.

430
0:19:30 --> 0:19:33
I don't know how to, I don't know how to like get anyone.

431
0:19:33 --> 0:19:35
But like, did you see that play?

432
0:19:35 --> 0:19:37
Like it was making me viral.

433
0:19:37 --> 0:19:40
I've been really intentionally not watching any football anything,

434
0:19:40 --> 0:19:44
but there was some college game and the kid is running down

435
0:19:44 --> 0:19:48
the field with the ball and just he's got nobody in front of him.

436
0:19:48 --> 0:19:49
He's almost the goal line.

437
0:19:50 --> 0:19:51
And he just walks off the side.

438
0:19:52 --> 0:19:53
Have you seen it?

439
0:19:53 --> 0:19:56
I love it because there's so many college games.

440
0:19:56 --> 0:19:56
So there's so many.

441
0:19:57 --> 0:20:00
That's the thing is like college sports specifically, right?

442
0:20:00 --> 0:20:01
So like you can watch the NBA and the NFL.

443
0:20:02 --> 0:20:04
You have 30 teams going at it, right?

444
0:20:04 --> 0:20:05
Or 332, whatever.

445
0:20:06 --> 0:20:10
And with college, you have hundreds and hundreds of 30 teams

446
0:20:10 --> 0:20:11
just in the big 10, right?

447
0:20:14 --> 0:20:16
And in those scenarios, right?

448
0:20:17 --> 0:20:20
Those smaller colleges where they're not making a lot of money.

449
0:20:21 --> 0:20:21
Right.

450
0:20:22 --> 0:20:22
So like this.

451
0:20:23 --> 0:20:26
Hey, if I had the opportunity to take two steps to the left

452
0:20:26 --> 0:20:28
and make $20,000, I think I'd do it.

453
0:20:28 --> 0:20:29
All right.

454
0:20:29 --> 0:20:31
You know, let's, all right.

455
0:20:31 --> 0:20:32
Let's test this.

456
0:20:32 --> 0:20:33
I'm in for 20.

457
0:20:33 --> 0:20:36
I just need a thousand people to join me.

458
0:20:38 --> 0:20:39
You're not in for 20,000.

459
0:20:39 --> 0:20:39
You're in for $20.

460
0:20:40 --> 0:20:40
I'm in for $20.

461
0:20:40 --> 0:20:45
But I just feel like, I just feel like you can't trust any sport

462
0:20:45 --> 0:20:47
at this point on a professional level.

463
0:20:48 --> 0:20:49
I don't think you have.

464
0:20:49 --> 0:20:50
Here's why.

465
0:20:50 --> 0:20:54
Here's why I think you are not wrong, but mistaken in the,

466
0:20:54 --> 0:20:56
in the path that you're going down.

467
0:20:56 --> 0:20:56
Okay.

468
0:20:57 --> 0:20:58
I don't think you have to go to gambling.

469
0:20:59 --> 0:21:02
I think you can just go to the, to the legit money,

470
0:21:02 --> 0:21:04
the quote unquote, legit money in it.

471
0:21:05 --> 0:21:06
And that's all you have.

472
0:21:06 --> 0:21:08
Like, I don't think you have to go to the gambling side of it.

473
0:21:08 --> 0:21:11
I don't think you have to go to the dark money to find the

474
0:21:11 --> 0:21:12
crazy shit that's going on.

475
0:21:12 --> 0:21:14
I was laughing so hard in a college football.

476
0:21:14 --> 0:21:16
It's it's getting nuts.

477
0:21:16 --> 0:21:16
Yeah.

478
0:21:16 --> 0:21:19
And Indiana, the mean that's going around is like Indiana's

479
0:21:19 --> 0:21:20
been terrible football for 150 years.

480
0:21:20 --> 0:21:22
You can pay players and suddenly they're they're good.

481
0:21:22 --> 0:21:25
They're like Indiana was the only only college playing by

482
0:21:25 --> 0:21:30
the rules for the last 150 years and I was laughing

483
0:21:30 --> 0:21:32
because Indiana won a crazy game against Ohio State

484
0:21:32 --> 0:21:34
and both players are interviewed.

485
0:21:34 --> 0:21:35
Like I want to thank God.

486
0:21:35 --> 0:21:37
I want to thank our Lord God, Lord God, Lord God.

487
0:21:37 --> 0:21:39
And I was like, buddy, you have the highest payroll.

488
0:21:40 --> 0:21:44
You can thank you can thank old Johnny Greenbacks.

489
0:21:44 --> 0:21:46
I think that's the best person you want to thank.

490
0:21:46 --> 0:21:49
You want to thank your river of money of boosters.

491
0:21:50 --> 0:21:50
Yeah.

492
0:21:51 --> 0:21:55
I want to thank God, which is what I call all of my

493
0:21:55 --> 0:21:57
sugar daddies here at Indiana University.

494
0:21:57 --> 0:21:57
Right.

495
0:21:57 --> 0:21:58
Thank you God.

496
0:21:58 --> 0:22:01
No, it's going to college football is going to get weird.

497
0:22:02 --> 0:22:05
College football is about to get bizarre because the

498
0:22:05 --> 0:22:08
amount of money that's going into that through like the

499
0:22:08 --> 0:22:10
legit channels.

500
0:22:10 --> 0:22:11
Yeah.

501
0:22:11 --> 0:22:13
It's it's so much money.

502
0:22:13 --> 0:22:14
It's yeah.

503
0:22:14 --> 0:22:14
It's going to be great.

504
0:22:14 --> 0:22:15
Oh yeah.

505
0:22:15 --> 0:22:17
And then Andy has mentioned the transfer portal being

506
0:22:17 --> 0:22:20
able to transfer from from team to team much more easily

507
0:22:20 --> 0:22:20
now.

508
0:22:21 --> 0:22:22
Oh yeah.

509
0:22:22 --> 0:22:25
But coaches like coaches leave teams with like,

510
0:22:25 --> 0:22:29
I'm going to leave this $12 million a year job.

511
0:22:29 --> 0:22:32
Even though I thought I was trying to stay for 10

512
0:22:32 --> 0:22:34
years, I'm going to leave because I was going to

513
0:22:34 --> 0:22:35
pay me even more money.

514
0:22:35 --> 0:22:36
Like you can't.

515
0:22:36 --> 0:22:38
There's no these contracts mean nothing.

516
0:22:38 --> 0:22:39
Yeah.

517
0:22:39 --> 0:22:41
No, no, that's a single thing.

518
0:22:41 --> 0:22:43
That's because the boosters because it's because it's

519
0:22:43 --> 0:22:45
even more infinite money than pro teams.

520
0:22:45 --> 0:22:46
Right.

521
0:22:46 --> 0:22:47
But there's 32 NFL teams, right?

522
0:22:49 --> 0:22:50
Yeah.

523
0:22:50 --> 0:22:50
It's just 30.

524
0:22:50 --> 0:22:51
I think it's 32.

525
0:22:51 --> 0:22:52
I think it's 32.

526
0:22:53 --> 0:22:57
So like if you're like the 33rd or 34th best quarterback,

527
0:22:58 --> 0:23:03
right, you can now make money by staying at a

528
0:23:03 --> 0:23:06
university and playing quarterback in college.

529
0:23:08 --> 0:23:09
If you just want to stay at Michigan.

530
0:23:10 --> 0:23:11
So what's going to happen?

531
0:23:11 --> 0:23:13
You can make more money playing at Michigan than you

532
0:23:13 --> 0:23:15
can backing up at the New England Patriots.

533
0:23:15 --> 0:23:17
What's going to happen would just make sense for

534
0:23:17 --> 0:23:19
me to play six, seven or eight years at Michigan.

535
0:23:20 --> 0:23:22
That's what I'm wondering is going to that's what's

536
0:23:22 --> 0:23:23
that's where it's going to get.

537
0:23:23 --> 0:23:26
We're going to have 35 year old is playing college ball.

538
0:23:26 --> 0:23:26
Right.

539
0:23:27 --> 0:23:30
I mean, a Shador Sanders is a good example of one.

540
0:23:30 --> 0:23:32
He's playing for the for the Cleveland Browns.

541
0:23:32 --> 0:23:37
Now he, uh, when the draft happened, he's a rookie this year.

542
0:23:37 --> 0:23:39
When the draft happened, uh, the place that he got

543
0:23:39 --> 0:23:42
drafted at, they said point blank, they were like,

544
0:23:42 --> 0:23:44
he could have made more money if he had just

545
0:23:44 --> 0:23:45
stayed another year in college.

546
0:23:45 --> 0:23:46
Yeah.

547
0:23:46 --> 0:23:47
Then if he had got drafted in the NFL.

548
0:23:48 --> 0:23:48
Yeah.

549
0:23:48 --> 0:23:49
They just say it.

550
0:23:49 --> 0:23:51
They're just like, oh yeah, he could have made

551
0:23:51 --> 0:23:53
more money if he had stayed at, uh, he played at

552
0:23:53 --> 0:23:54
the University of Colorado.

553
0:23:54 --> 0:23:56
They could have just stayed there and made more money.

554
0:23:57 --> 0:23:58
That would have just been it.

555
0:23:59 --> 0:23:59
Yeah.

556
0:24:00 --> 0:24:04
Uh, lower green copper scale in chats isn't, isn't, uh,

557
0:24:04 --> 0:24:05
youth league in high school football, falling out of

558
0:24:05 --> 0:24:06
favor for safer sports.

559
0:24:07 --> 0:24:11
Yes, uh, a large, a large part, yes, but for the

560
0:24:11 --> 0:24:14
less glorious positions like linemen and things like

561
0:24:14 --> 0:24:17
that are, you're finding, uh, it's harder and harder

562
0:24:17 --> 0:24:20
to find these quality people want to sacrifice

563
0:24:20 --> 0:24:22
their bodies for, for the thankless positions.

564
0:24:22 --> 0:24:25
Well, again, I can't, I can't say it enough like that,

565
0:24:25 --> 0:24:28
that Aaron Hernandez, special secretary,

566
0:24:28 --> 0:24:30
that last podcast did, they did like three

567
0:24:30 --> 0:24:36
episodes on him and both, uh, Marcus and Ed were

568
0:24:36 --> 0:24:39
like, we came up as youth people, young men

569
0:24:39 --> 0:24:41
playing football and they talked about the

570
0:24:41 --> 0:24:43
horrors of it through high school and all

571
0:24:43 --> 0:24:44
that kind of stuff.

572
0:24:44 --> 0:24:46
And it's just, it's, you know, it really,

573
0:24:47 --> 0:24:47
it was insane.

574
0:24:48 --> 0:24:49
It was, it changed their mind.

575
0:24:49 --> 0:24:50
It was insane.

576
0:24:50 --> 0:24:52
They've been, they've been football, like Ed

577
0:24:52 --> 0:24:53
has been a football fan forever.

578
0:24:53 --> 0:24:55
Like Miami Dolphins is like part of his

579
0:24:55 --> 0:24:57
identity as a human being.

580
0:24:57 --> 0:25:01
And he's now, just now after all this, this,

581
0:25:01 --> 0:25:04
this podcast, this little podcast run and

582
0:25:04 --> 0:25:05
doing the research in it, he's really

583
0:25:05 --> 0:25:07
just starting to change his mind around

584
0:25:07 --> 0:25:09
the CTE and the dangers of the sport

585
0:25:09 --> 0:25:11
and just the inhumanity of it.

586
0:25:12 --> 0:25:15
My brother was captain of his football team

587
0:25:15 --> 0:25:18
in the high school and he tells stories

588
0:25:18 --> 0:25:21
that I'm still afraid to repeat here now.

589
0:25:22 --> 0:25:23
That I'm like, really?

590
0:25:24 --> 0:25:27
That went down like that would be a crazy

591
0:25:27 --> 0:25:28
crazy scandal.

592
0:25:28 --> 0:25:29
Yes.

593
0:25:30 --> 0:25:31
There are, there are things that happened

594
0:25:31 --> 0:25:34
on a regular basis on the, on the teams

595
0:25:34 --> 0:25:38
at my high school that people would go

596
0:25:38 --> 0:25:39
to jail for now.

597
0:25:39 --> 0:25:39
Yeah.

598
0:25:40 --> 0:25:41
They would just, they would go to jail

599
0:25:41 --> 0:25:43
for like child endangerment and things

600
0:25:43 --> 0:25:44
like, and I'm not talking about like

601
0:25:44 --> 0:25:46
terrible things or anything, but just,

602
0:25:46 --> 0:25:48
you know, just the standard things

603
0:25:48 --> 0:25:49
that we would practice.

604
0:25:49 --> 0:25:52
Like, yeah, fights, the, the cursing,

605
0:25:53 --> 0:25:54
the, you know, all the, all the weird,

606
0:25:54 --> 0:25:58
yeah, it was just weird, bizarre shit

607
0:25:58 --> 0:26:00
and looking back on it, you're like, well,

608
0:26:00 --> 0:26:03
that's 16 year old kids doing this

609
0:26:03 --> 0:26:05
shit and like the old ones are 18.

610
0:26:06 --> 0:26:08
Like this is, this is stupid.

611
0:26:08 --> 0:26:09
This is just dumb.

612
0:26:10 --> 0:26:12
I'll tell you what else is dumb,

613
0:26:12 --> 0:26:14
but not because they're dumb, because

614
0:26:14 --> 0:26:14
we're dumb.

615
0:26:14 --> 0:26:16
And that's the following sponsor.

616
0:26:16 --> 0:26:18
Today's show is brought to you by,

617
0:26:18 --> 0:26:20

No, today's show is brought to you by

621
0:26:26 --> 0:26:27
Paul Mattingly's.

622
0:26:27 --> 0:26:28
That wasn't a scream.

623
0:26:29 --> 0:26:31
Now watch me beam as I use my extreme,

624
0:26:31 --> 0:26:33
stream alcohol based wean wean

625
0:26:33 --> 0:26:36
in between, between your masturbation

626
0:26:36 --> 0:26:36
cream.

627
0:26:36 --> 0:26:38
And that's from the scoop of money

628
0:26:38 --> 0:26:39
Christo in 2022.

629
0:26:39 --> 0:26:41
He's been waiting three years to hear

630
0:26:41 --> 0:26:41
that Paul.

631
0:26:45 --> 0:26:46
I don't know if it's a product.

632
0:26:47 --> 0:26:47
I think I just said it.

633
0:26:47 --> 0:26:48
Do you want me to repeat it or

634
0:26:48 --> 0:26:49
just go to another place?

635
0:26:49 --> 0:26:50
Just repeat it.

636
0:26:50 --> 0:26:52
Paul Mattingly's.

637
0:26:52 --> 0:26:53
That wasn't a scream.

638
0:26:54 --> 0:26:57
Now watch me beam as I use my extreme,

639
0:26:57 --> 0:27:01
stream alcohol based wean wean

640
0:27:01 --> 0:27:04
in between masturbation cream.

641
0:27:04 --> 0:27:05
So I guess the masturbation cream spot.

642
0:27:06 --> 0:27:07
Oh, it's okay.

643
0:27:07 --> 0:27:08
It's masturbation cream.

644
0:27:08 --> 0:27:09
Yeah.

645
0:27:09 --> 0:27:09
All right.

646
0:27:10 --> 0:27:11
Hi, fellas.

647
0:27:11 --> 0:27:12
Paul Mattingly here.

648
0:27:13 --> 0:27:14
Tired of screaming and pain from

649
0:27:14 --> 0:27:16
rubbing your dick raw with your

650
0:27:16 --> 0:27:17
chaffed hands and no lubrication.

651
0:27:18 --> 0:27:20
Well, got a solution for you.

652
0:27:20 --> 0:27:22
Use some masturbation cream.

653
0:27:22 --> 0:27:23
Yeah.

654
0:27:23 --> 0:27:24
It's a whole lot better than going

655
0:27:24 --> 0:27:27
in full barbecue dry rub style.

656
0:27:28 --> 0:27:31
In fact, that was my problem.

657
0:27:32 --> 0:27:35
I honestly mistake as a young man.

658
0:27:35 --> 0:27:35
Yeah.

659
0:27:35 --> 0:27:38
Mistakenly grabbed a bottle of dry rub

660
0:27:39 --> 0:27:41
thinking, well, this will do in a pinch.

661
0:27:42 --> 0:27:42
No.

662
0:27:43 --> 0:27:46
Cajun spice will taint your urethra

663
0:27:47 --> 0:27:48
and it won't help.

664
0:27:48 --> 0:27:52
So don't dry rub your wiener.

665
0:27:53 --> 0:27:54
Don't dry rub your wiener.

666
0:27:54 --> 0:27:57
Don't dry rub your wiener.

667
0:27:57 --> 0:28:00
Use some of Paul's cream instead.

668
0:28:01 --> 0:28:04
Don't dry rub your wiener or your

669
0:28:04 --> 0:28:06
dickhead will be dead.

670
0:28:08 --> 0:28:10
Don't dry rub your wiener.

671
0:28:10 --> 0:28:13
Cream is the way to go.

672
0:28:14 --> 0:28:16
Don't dry rub your wiener.

673
0:28:17 --> 0:28:19
Your balls will smell like roses, you know.

674
0:28:21 --> 0:28:24
Said, don't dry rub your wiener.

675
0:28:24 --> 0:28:27
Your penis deserves better than that.

676
0:28:28 --> 0:28:32
Don't dry rub your wiener unless you

677
0:28:32 --> 0:28:34
like a bloody handful of wiener.

678
0:28:36 --> 0:28:37
Splat.

679
0:28:38 --> 0:28:38
Splat.

680
0:28:39 --> 0:28:40
And there are eight scoops of checkout.

681
0:28:40 --> 0:28:40
And a what?

682
0:28:41 --> 0:28:43
That's what some people like.

683
0:28:43 --> 0:28:45
Not going to yuck anybody's yum.

684
0:28:46 --> 0:28:49
Go ahead, grab a fistful of gravel and a wish.

685
0:28:49 --> 0:28:50
Go for it.

686
0:28:56 --> 0:28:57
Well, then.

687
0:29:00 --> 0:29:02
I've heard the story, not yucking people's yum.

688
0:29:03 --> 0:29:05
This is, I'm third hand on this story.

689
0:29:05 --> 0:29:05
Okay.

690
0:29:06 --> 0:29:06
Third hand.

691
0:29:06 --> 0:29:07
All right.

692
0:29:07 --> 0:29:10
So this is going to be straight from the horse's ass.

693
0:29:10 --> 0:29:13
Friend of a friend works at the John Wick experience.

694
0:29:15 --> 0:29:15
Okay.

695
0:29:16 --> 0:29:16
Someone broader.

696
0:29:16 --> 0:29:17
Area 15.

697
0:29:17 --> 0:29:18
Area 15.

698
0:29:18 --> 0:29:19
Area 15.

699
0:29:19 --> 0:29:25
And they, a customer brought with them a real doll and said,

700
0:29:25 --> 0:29:31
can I, can I also bring my companion with me and brought in a sex doll as a.

701
0:29:32 --> 0:29:33
Oh, okay.

702
0:29:33 --> 0:29:34
Okay.

703
0:29:34 --> 0:29:35
Are they married?

704
0:29:36 --> 0:29:37
They had a backstory.

705
0:29:38 --> 0:29:39
I don't know the backstory.

706
0:29:40 --> 0:29:43
Was he carrying the doll or was it in like,

707
0:29:43 --> 0:29:44
was it in like a wheelbarrow?

708
0:29:44 --> 0:29:45
What are we talking about here?

709
0:29:45 --> 0:29:46
A wheelbarrow.

710
0:29:48 --> 0:29:51
It was a arm wrapped around the shoulder.

711
0:29:52 --> 0:29:52
Arm around the waist.

712
0:29:53 --> 0:29:53
What?

713
0:29:53 --> 0:29:54
It was scary.

714
0:29:54 --> 0:29:56
It was like a, like a baby monkey.

715
0:29:56 --> 0:29:58
It was wrapped on him like a baby monkey.

716
0:29:58 --> 0:29:59
Yeah.

717
0:30:00 --> 0:30:03
No, don't go wrapping your sex doll around you like a baby monkey.

718
0:30:03 --> 0:30:03
That's.

719
0:30:04 --> 0:30:04
Yeah.

720
0:30:04 --> 0:30:06
Stick to the rivers and the streams that you're used to.

721
0:30:07 --> 0:30:09
Did you carry your kids like baby monkeys?

722
0:30:10 --> 0:30:11
I carried whatever way they wanted.

723
0:30:11 --> 0:30:13
I carried them every which way I could.

724
0:30:13 --> 0:30:14
What, what, what was best?

725
0:30:14 --> 0:30:17
Was it arms over shoulders or legs over shoulders?

726
0:30:17 --> 0:30:18
That's easier, right?

727
0:30:18 --> 0:30:19
Legs over shoulders is easier.

728
0:30:20 --> 0:30:20
Right.

729
0:30:21 --> 0:30:22
Firemen's carry in a pinch.

730
0:30:23 --> 0:30:23
Okay.

731
0:30:24 --> 0:30:25
Like if there's a fire.

732
0:30:26 --> 0:30:26
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

733
0:30:27 --> 0:30:30
Some kids rest easy on the hip and some don't.

734
0:30:30 --> 0:30:30
It's a weird thing.

735
0:30:30 --> 0:30:32
So one of my kids was very easy to just hold on the hip

736
0:30:33 --> 0:30:34
and one of my kids was could not.

737
0:30:35 --> 0:30:35
It was just uncomfortable.

738
0:30:36 --> 0:30:37
Both of us couldn't stay there.

739
0:30:37 --> 0:30:37
Didn't like it.

740
0:30:38 --> 0:30:39
So what was the solution?

741
0:30:40 --> 0:30:40
Stop.

742
0:30:40 --> 0:30:41
Start walking.

743
0:30:41 --> 0:30:42
Stop raising him.

744
0:30:42 --> 0:30:43
Stop loving him.

745
0:30:43 --> 0:30:43
Stop.

746
0:30:43 --> 0:30:44
Sure, sure, sure.

747
0:30:44 --> 0:30:47
I mean, that's when clearly we're genetically incompatible.

748
0:30:48 --> 0:30:49
Put him on ice flow.

749
0:30:50 --> 0:30:50
He knows.

750
0:30:51 --> 0:30:52
I mean, I think he's doing great.

751
0:30:53 --> 0:30:53
I don't know.

752
0:30:55 --> 0:30:57
What happened to Matt's third son?

753
0:30:58 --> 0:31:00
It's our new favorite segment.

754
0:31:00 --> 0:31:03
A baby that didn't fit on Matt's hip.

755
0:31:05 --> 0:31:07
These are the reasons Matt throws away kids.

756
0:31:08 --> 0:31:10
Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to,

757
0:31:10 --> 0:31:11
I wasn't going to argue with Mike Nielsen,

758
0:31:11 --> 0:31:12
but Mike Nielsen says yes, me and my real doll

759
0:31:12 --> 0:31:14
love John Wick and we had to go see it.

760
0:31:16 --> 0:31:17
So, okay.

761
0:31:18 --> 0:31:20
Okay, so somebody pulls up with a wheel barrel

762
0:31:20 --> 0:31:21
with a real doll.

763
0:31:21 --> 0:31:22
Was this allowed?

764
0:31:22 --> 0:31:24
And they said, they basically said

765
0:31:24 --> 0:31:25
as long as you pay for two tickets,

766
0:31:25 --> 0:31:27
we don't, you can do whatever you want.

767
0:31:27 --> 0:31:28
And so.

768
0:31:28 --> 0:31:30
They made him pay for a second ticket.

769
0:31:30 --> 0:31:30
Isn't that funny?

770
0:31:31 --> 0:31:32
I think I was like, that's a good one though.

771
0:31:32 --> 0:31:34
Hey, they made him pay for a second ticket.

772
0:31:34 --> 0:31:38
But, but the doll is taking up the space,

773
0:31:38 --> 0:31:39
number one and number two.

774
0:31:40 --> 0:31:43
Doesn't that reinforce his dream even more?

775
0:31:43 --> 0:31:45
That's, that's what I was going to say.

776
0:31:45 --> 0:31:48
I was like, I bet he, I bet he liked paying for the second ticket.

777
0:31:48 --> 0:31:50
Of course I'll have to pay.

778
0:31:50 --> 0:31:52
She's another, she's a person.

779
0:31:52 --> 0:31:53
I'm still assuming he.

780
0:31:53 --> 0:31:54
Was it a she?

781
0:31:55 --> 0:31:57
It was a guy with a girl doll.

782
0:31:58 --> 0:31:58
Yeah, yeah.

783
0:31:58 --> 0:31:58
Yeah, yeah.

784
0:31:59 --> 0:31:59
That's what I was going to say.

785
0:31:59 --> 0:32:00
Okay, that mean, yeah.

786
0:32:00 --> 0:32:01
That's, that's what it would be.

787
0:32:01 --> 0:32:02
Yes, Supernova Girl.

788
0:32:02 --> 0:32:03
It was Jimmy Sloanina.

789
0:32:04 --> 0:32:05
Jimmy Sloanina.

790
0:32:05 --> 0:32:06
Oh Lord.

791
0:32:08 --> 0:32:09
Jimmy and Jenna.

792
0:32:09 --> 0:32:12
She scooped Jesus says, the lady will be paying.

793
0:32:15 --> 0:32:16
That'd be so funny.

794
0:32:17 --> 0:32:17
We're going Dutch.

795
0:32:17 --> 0:32:18
That'd be so funny.

796
0:32:18 --> 0:32:21
He's like, he like puts the money in her hand

797
0:32:21 --> 0:32:23
and like shakes it off on the counter.

798
0:32:23 --> 0:32:24
Two different debit cards.

799
0:32:25 --> 0:32:27
Here you go sir.

800
0:32:28 --> 0:32:30
I'll be paying for both of us today.

801
0:32:31 --> 0:32:33
I treat my man like a prince.

802
0:32:34 --> 0:32:36
He's carrying me like a baby monkey.

803
0:32:36 --> 0:32:37
Woo hoo hoo.

804
0:32:39 --> 0:32:42
Apparently he did speak in her voice for different parts.

805
0:32:42 --> 0:32:42
Stop it.

806
0:32:43 --> 0:32:43
Yeah.

807
0:32:43 --> 0:32:44
Stop it.

808
0:32:45 --> 0:32:45
No.

809
0:32:45 --> 0:32:46
No, I'm so happy.

810
0:32:46 --> 0:32:47
I'm so happy.

811
0:32:48 --> 0:32:50
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

812
0:32:51 --> 0:32:54
Sometimes I think that John Wick movies are a little over the top

813
0:32:54 --> 0:32:57
but I really like, like the, the character

814
0:32:57 --> 0:33:00
and his motivation over the death of his dog

815
0:33:01 --> 0:33:05
was just an emotional connection to his wife.

816
0:33:05 --> 0:33:06
Sorry, my wife's been drinking.

817
0:33:07 --> 0:33:07
I'm so sorry.

818
0:33:07 --> 0:33:10
Hey, I can handle my liquor.

819
0:33:11 --> 0:33:13
Speaking of liquor, it's been a minute.

820
0:33:13 --> 0:33:16
Better take me to the bathroom and rough up this puss puss.

821
0:33:23 --> 0:33:24
Don't try, Robert.

822
0:33:25 --> 0:33:27
You better put your mouth where my money is

823
0:33:27 --> 0:33:29
and by money, I mean pussy hole.

824
0:33:30 --> 0:33:33
And by pussy hole, I mean strange plastic cavern

825
0:33:33 --> 0:33:34
that needs cleaning.

826
0:33:36 --> 0:33:37
Built-in flashlight.

827
0:33:37 --> 0:33:37
Okay.

828
0:33:38 --> 0:33:40
He wish it was a built-in flashlight.

829
0:33:44 --> 0:33:46
It's basically saran wrap.

830
0:33:47 --> 0:33:48
Oh no.

831
0:33:50 --> 0:33:58
Saran wrap and Crisco at this point, he ran out.

832
0:33:59 --> 0:34:03
One of the robotic parts of my puss puss went failure town

833
0:34:04 --> 0:34:09
and he just replaced my innards with saran wrap and Crisco.

834
0:34:09 --> 0:34:12
Crisco was a poor choice for several reasons.

835
0:34:17 --> 0:34:19
I'm saran wrap and I'm Crisco.

836
0:34:20 --> 0:34:21
We go together.

837
0:34:22 --> 0:34:24
I'm saran wrap and I'm Crisco.

838
0:34:27 --> 0:34:30
My horrible innards attract flies

839
0:34:30 --> 0:34:33
and you can't tell where the Crisco starts

840
0:34:33 --> 0:34:34
and the old cum stops.

841
0:34:35 --> 0:34:38
So, you know, cleaning up is not a breeze as it were.

842
0:34:40 --> 0:34:41
Okay.

843
0:34:42 --> 0:34:47
It's the old cum again.

844
0:34:48 --> 0:34:51
I want that to be the only time in my life I hear old cum.

845
0:34:52 --> 0:34:55
Where does the Crisco stop and the old cum start?

846
0:34:55 --> 0:34:56
I don't know.

847
0:34:59 --> 0:35:00
I'm just not okay with that.

848
0:35:02 --> 0:35:04
At one point, he drops her.

849
0:35:05 --> 0:35:05
Oh god.

850
0:35:06 --> 0:35:06
Yeah.

851
0:35:06 --> 0:35:07
What happened?

852
0:35:08 --> 0:35:09
The eyes popped out.

853
0:35:15 --> 0:35:18
I can't believe what I'm seeing at the John Wick experience.

854
0:35:22 --> 0:35:23
Can't believe my eyes.

855
0:35:24 --> 0:35:25
This is where it gets weird.

856
0:35:25 --> 0:35:27
Up and at this point, not weird.

857
0:35:27 --> 0:35:30
Not weird, but this is where it gets weird.

858
0:35:30 --> 0:35:30
Yep.

859
0:35:32 --> 0:35:36
He quickly, again, third hand story,

860
0:35:37 --> 0:35:41
pockets the eyes, picks them up, puts them in the pocket.

861
0:35:41 --> 0:35:42
Like, oops.

862
0:35:42 --> 0:35:42
Okay.

863
0:35:43 --> 0:35:45
Still carries around the island's doll

864
0:35:45 --> 0:35:46
for the rest of the experience.

865
0:35:48 --> 0:35:50
Doesn't go about putting the eyes back in.

866
0:35:50 --> 0:35:51
No.

867
0:35:51 --> 0:35:54
Because he knows there's a possibility of a second drop

868
0:35:54 --> 0:35:57
and he's lucky to have fished him out when he did.

869
0:35:58 --> 0:35:58
Maybe.

870
0:35:59 --> 0:36:00
Yeah, I think so.

871
0:36:00 --> 0:36:02
I bet, because I bet those things are, I bet those are probably

872
0:36:02 --> 0:36:04
some of the more expensive parts of the doll.

873
0:36:06 --> 0:36:08
Also, he's fucking those eye holes.

874
0:36:09 --> 0:36:10
Thank you.

875
0:36:10 --> 0:36:13
Thank you for saying it before I had to say it.

876
0:36:15 --> 0:36:16
That doll is getting skull fucked.

877
0:36:18 --> 0:36:20
Those eyes are not supposed to come out.

878
0:36:22 --> 0:36:24
What was I supposed to do, your honor?

879
0:36:25 --> 0:36:26
Not fuck those eye holes?

880
0:36:27 --> 0:36:30
It's a real eye-popping experience.

881
0:36:30 --> 0:36:32
It's a John Wick experience.

882
0:36:32 --> 0:36:34
He's super Nova girl.

883
0:36:34 --> 0:36:38
If you'd seen the kind of mascara she was wearing, your honor,

884
0:36:39 --> 0:36:40
she was asking for it.

885
0:36:41 --> 0:36:44
Oh, has anyone done a ventriloquist act with a real doll?

886
0:36:46 --> 0:36:47
Who's that?

887
0:36:47 --> 0:36:48
Lorgren?

888
0:36:48 --> 0:36:48
Lorgren.

889
0:36:49 --> 0:36:51
That's a great idea.

890
0:36:51 --> 0:36:52
I don't know.

891
0:36:53 --> 0:37:01
Yeah, it's super uncomfortable, funny, to imagine a whole doll there.

892
0:37:03 --> 0:37:05
Because it could start off like kind of normal,

893
0:37:05 --> 0:37:06
then real quick it just be all about,

894
0:37:07 --> 0:37:10
you do terrible things to me in the night all the time.

895
0:37:11 --> 0:37:13
You do the most horrible shit.

896
0:37:16 --> 0:37:17
Nicholas Newman's in the chat wants to know

897
0:37:17 --> 0:37:18
there's a link for these dolls.

898
0:37:19 --> 0:37:20
Yeah, I already put the link up.

899
0:37:20 --> 0:37:21
It's done.

900
0:37:22 --> 0:37:23
realdoll.com.

901
0:37:24 --> 0:37:25
Sponsor the show realdoll.com.

902
0:37:25 --> 0:37:26
Was that this episode or the last episode

903
0:37:26 --> 0:37:27
we talked about a horse herpes?

904
0:37:28 --> 0:37:29
Last episode.

905
0:37:29 --> 0:37:30
It was the last episode?

906
0:37:31 --> 0:37:34
Yeah, we were desperate to have Nicholas's

907
0:37:35 --> 0:37:37
expert commentary, but we didn't have him here.

908
0:37:38 --> 0:37:39
No, well, it's too late now.

909
0:37:40 --> 0:37:41
He's right there, Jacob.

910
0:37:42 --> 0:37:42
We can just ask him now.

911
0:37:42 --> 0:37:42
No, no, it's too late.

912
0:37:43 --> 0:37:43
It's too late.

913
0:37:43 --> 0:37:44
Okay.

914
0:37:44 --> 0:37:46
Nothing could be done.

915
0:37:46 --> 0:37:46
It's too late.

916
0:37:47 --> 0:37:47
Yeah.

917
0:37:48 --> 0:37:49
It's the start of this episode.

918
0:37:49 --> 0:37:50
It wasn't this episode.

919
0:37:51 --> 0:37:52
I thought it was.

920
0:37:52 --> 0:37:54
It doesn't matter because I didn't hit record anyway,

921
0:37:54 --> 0:37:56
so we're only getting recorded anyway,

922
0:37:56 --> 0:37:57
so we're not going to record him if he talks.

923
0:37:58 --> 0:38:01
Say there, real doll, could you call me a cab?

924
0:38:03 --> 0:38:05
Okay, you're a cab.

925
0:38:06 --> 0:38:09
Also, I'm going to call myself a cab

926
0:38:09 --> 0:38:11
so I can escape this treacherous relationship

927
0:38:11 --> 0:38:12
that I have with you.

928
0:38:14 --> 0:38:17
I'm very tired of having organic food

929
0:38:17 --> 0:38:19
stuffed inside of me.

930
0:38:21 --> 0:38:25
I, it was one thing to try it one time,

931
0:38:25 --> 0:38:29
but now every time, every Saturday night,

932
0:38:29 --> 0:38:33
it's, oh, here comes the 82% ground chuck

933
0:38:33 --> 0:38:35
right up my vagina.

934
0:38:38 --> 0:38:41
Mike, this is the G.S. for an angel shot.

935
0:38:43 --> 0:38:44
Oh, no.

936
0:38:47 --> 0:38:49
She has to be angel shot.

937
0:38:49 --> 0:38:51
Please put me out of my misery.

938
0:38:52 --> 0:38:53
I'm asking for the angel shot.

939
0:38:53 --> 0:38:56
One between the eyes and two behind the ears.

940
0:38:57 --> 0:38:58
Make sure it's done right.

941
0:38:59 --> 0:39:00
Cancel me out.

942
0:39:00 --> 0:39:02
Two behind the ears.

943
0:39:02 --> 0:39:04
One between the eyes and two behind the ears.

944
0:39:04 --> 0:39:06
Make me an angel, please.

945
0:39:07 --> 0:39:08
Please kill me.

946
0:39:09 --> 0:39:13
I'm tired of having raw beef inside of my asshole

947
0:39:13 --> 0:39:15
for this man to fuck on.

948
0:39:17 --> 0:39:18
So sick of it.

949
0:39:18 --> 0:39:20
I'm glad I got that nice and clean as a drop.

950
0:39:24 --> 0:39:26
Oh, it's not going to be a clean drop tonight.

951
0:39:28 --> 0:39:29
That's the worst part.

952
0:39:30 --> 0:39:32
I wouldn't mind if it was all just, you know,

953
0:39:32 --> 0:39:35
but this is what becomes dinner later.

954
0:39:35 --> 0:39:39
He squeezes it out of me and fries it up in a pan.

955
0:39:40 --> 0:39:41
I can fuck on the bacon.

956
0:39:43 --> 0:39:45
The desirous, real gold do anything else

957
0:39:45 --> 0:39:48
while they were going through the John Wick experience?

958
0:39:48 --> 0:39:50
Well, somebody was asking, was it dressed?

959
0:39:51 --> 0:39:52
Did you get a description of the clothing?

960
0:39:53 --> 0:39:58
It was like a sexy hot-tailed, what was it?

961
0:39:58 --> 0:39:58
Nymph fish?

962
0:39:59 --> 0:40:00
Like dressed like a...

963
0:40:00 --> 0:40:01
Yeah, like it was so sexy.

964
0:40:01 --> 0:40:02
Nymph fish, what are you saying?

965
0:40:03 --> 0:40:05
Yes, nymph, like...

966
0:40:05 --> 0:40:06
Nymph fish?

967
0:40:06 --> 0:40:07
Pixie.

968
0:40:07 --> 0:40:08
Oh, pixie.

969
0:40:08 --> 0:40:09
Okay.

970
0:40:10 --> 0:40:10
Elf?

971
0:40:11 --> 0:40:12
Maybe, does that help you?

972
0:40:12 --> 0:40:13
Well, did it have elf ears?

973
0:40:14 --> 0:40:16
How the elf would I know?

974
0:40:18 --> 0:40:19
Good joke.

975
0:40:19 --> 0:40:24
Now stop abusing my nose cavity with your filthy penis.

976
0:40:25 --> 0:40:25
Please.

977
0:40:30 --> 0:40:34
My sinuses, my sinuses look like mammoth cave

978
0:40:34 --> 0:40:36
with stalactites of your old dried gum.

979
0:40:38 --> 0:40:41
You know you're never getting that shit out of my cranium.

980
0:40:44 --> 0:40:45
That's true, Paul.

981
0:40:46 --> 0:40:46
That's true.

982
0:40:47 --> 0:40:48
This is a good time to remind people

983
0:40:48 --> 0:40:50
that we have an obelisk scheme.

984
0:40:50 --> 0:40:52
If you're looking for one person or one person only

985
0:40:52 --> 0:40:53
to turn onto this podcast.

986
0:40:57 --> 0:41:00
Have them check out the hot sex talk

987
0:41:00 --> 0:41:03
complaining about abuse and old gum.

988
0:41:04 --> 0:41:04
There you go.

989
0:41:06 --> 0:41:08
Crisco was a mistake, yeah.

990
0:41:15 --> 0:41:16
$11,000.

991
0:41:18 --> 0:41:19
For what?

992
0:41:19 --> 0:41:20
I'm sorry, I should have asked you

993
0:41:20 --> 0:41:23
how much do you think a real doll costs?

994
0:41:23 --> 0:41:26
That seems cheap.

995
0:41:26 --> 0:41:27
That seems cheap.

996
0:41:27 --> 0:41:28
No.

997
0:41:28 --> 0:41:30
How much do you pay for your real dolls, Paul?

998
0:41:31 --> 0:41:35
I've looked into their pricing and like 20,

999
0:41:35 --> 0:41:37
so he's had like an economy model.

1000
0:41:37 --> 0:41:39
He's basically fucking a Ugo.

1001
0:41:40 --> 0:41:41
Well, I don't know what he had.

1002
0:41:41 --> 0:41:44
That's not, I'm just looking at the website here.

1003
0:41:44 --> 0:41:45
I just clicked on the first one.

1004
0:41:45 --> 0:41:47
He's, yeah, he's out there fucking Ugos.

1005
0:41:48 --> 0:41:48
You want, man,

1006
0:41:49 --> 0:41:51
especially if you're going to take her out in public,

1007
0:41:51 --> 0:41:52
you better be having a Maserati.

1008
0:41:53 --> 0:41:55
Yeah, it didn't have heated seats.

1009
0:41:55 --> 0:41:56
That's right, Nick.

1010
0:41:57 --> 0:41:57
You got, you got a,

1011
0:41:57 --> 0:41:59
when it's got those built-in warmers,

1012
0:41:59 --> 0:42:02
because there's nothing worse than three AM

1013
0:42:03 --> 0:42:07
sliding it in to some cold roast beef inside that butthole.

1014
0:42:08 --> 0:42:10
Oh, nothing worse than that, Paul.

1015
0:42:11 --> 0:42:12
I mean, I have a single thing worse than that.

1016
0:42:13 --> 0:42:15
What's worse is after you bust and then you,

1017
0:42:15 --> 0:42:16
you forget and then you turn her over

1018
0:42:16 --> 0:42:18
and then you end up in the wet spot.

1019
0:42:18 --> 0:42:19
And it's like, well, this is all my fault.

1020
0:42:20 --> 0:42:21
How much for just raw doll?

1021
0:42:22 --> 0:42:23
Just raw doll.

1022
0:42:26 --> 0:42:28
Matt, I think what you'd be interested in

1023
0:42:28 --> 0:42:29
is the torso model.

1024
0:42:31 --> 0:42:32
Oh, no.

1025
0:42:33 --> 0:42:33
Just torso?

1026
0:42:34 --> 0:42:35
Just torso.

1027
0:42:35 --> 0:42:37
That is very much an availability.

1028
0:42:37 --> 0:42:38
I don't want any lip.

1029
0:42:38 --> 0:42:39
I don't want any mouth.

1030
0:42:40 --> 0:42:41
That's exactly what it get.

1031
0:42:41 --> 0:42:42
You get a torso.

1032
0:42:45 --> 0:42:47
It's all her bombs, says Leon.

1033
0:42:47 --> 0:42:49
They call her Bob.

1034
0:42:49 --> 0:42:50
Of course they do.

1035
0:42:50 --> 0:42:54
Buying a real doll now is like buying a Blackberry in 2003.

1036
0:42:54 --> 0:42:56
Like it's just, it's just,

1037
0:42:56 --> 0:42:59
we're about to get fucking crazy with this shit.

1038
0:43:00 --> 0:43:01
And you're going to be like-

1039
0:43:01 --> 0:43:03
You think this is a dumb investment?

1040
0:43:03 --> 0:43:06
Or is this the smart move, Matt?

1041
0:43:07 --> 0:43:08
And a Blackberry might be a smart,

1042
0:43:08 --> 0:43:10
because don't you want a dumb real doll?

1043
0:43:10 --> 0:43:13
You don't want this thing fucking spying on you

1044
0:43:13 --> 0:43:14
and killing you in your sleep?

1045
0:43:14 --> 0:43:16
These things are, according to their website,

1046
0:43:16 --> 0:43:18
they already have AI vaginas.

1047
0:43:21 --> 0:43:23
No, Jacob, you misread that.

1048
0:43:23 --> 0:43:26
It's A1 because of all the raw beef that's crammed in there.

1049
0:43:26 --> 0:43:27
Oh, the raw beef!

1050
0:43:27 --> 0:43:31
A little steak sauce gets things moving.

1051
0:43:31 --> 0:43:33
It's an A1 vagina.

1052
0:43:37 --> 0:43:39
We're not on Twitch, right?

1053
0:43:40 --> 0:43:41
Oh, yeah, we are on Twitch.

1054
0:43:41 --> 0:43:42
Oh, yeah, we are.

1055
0:43:42 --> 0:43:44
That's why I haven't put pictures of these real dolls

1056
0:43:44 --> 0:43:45
that are fighting up on Twitch.

1057
0:43:47 --> 0:43:48
That was like-

1058
0:43:48 --> 0:43:49
Because I've definitely found some pictures

1059
0:43:49 --> 0:43:51
of just the torsos.

1060
0:43:51 --> 0:43:51
Of course!

1061
0:43:54 --> 0:43:57
Or as they call it on this website, the Donnelly.

1062
0:43:57 --> 0:44:00
I mean, Jacob, you drive a scooter half the time.

1063
0:44:00 --> 0:44:01
I don't like the Donnelly Herald

1064
0:44:01 --> 0:44:03
and I don't like the Donnelly Torso either.

1065
0:44:05 --> 0:44:07
You know, we don't get to name our legacies.

1066
0:44:08 --> 0:44:10
The Donnelly Torso.

1067
0:44:11 --> 0:44:13
No, it's not the episode title.

1068
0:44:13 --> 0:44:14
Fuck you guys.

1069
0:44:16 --> 0:44:18
It's definitely the episode title.

1070
0:44:18 --> 0:44:19
It takes two to torso.

1071
0:44:21 --> 0:44:23
Well, you have to have a really active imagination

1072
0:44:23 --> 0:44:24
to go just torso.

1073
0:44:25 --> 0:44:27
Like, you really just have to do all of the math.

1074
0:44:27 --> 0:44:28
It's not about that.

1075
0:44:28 --> 0:44:32
It's about think about having to mess around

1076
0:44:32 --> 0:44:33
with the legs all the time.

1077
0:44:34 --> 0:44:35
Oh, yeah.

1078
0:44:35 --> 0:44:37
No, that's what I say to my wife all the time.

1079
0:44:37 --> 0:44:38
Where do these legs do it?

1080
0:44:38 --> 0:44:40
It saves several steps.

1081
0:44:44 --> 0:44:47
What steps does it save specifically, Mattingly?

1082
0:44:47 --> 0:44:51
It saves moving giant metal poles out of your way for your dick.

1083
0:44:51 --> 0:44:52
That's what it saves.

1084
0:44:54 --> 0:44:56
Come over here, Bob.

1085
0:45:01 --> 0:45:01
What a world.

1086
0:45:02 --> 0:45:05
But do you think those kids are going to last?

1087
0:45:05 --> 0:45:05
Do you think it has AI vaginas?

1088
0:45:06 --> 0:45:08
It says it has AI vaginas.

1089
0:45:08 --> 0:45:09
I don't know what that means.

1090
0:45:10 --> 0:45:12
I've been looking on their website to see what that means.

1091
0:45:13 --> 0:45:14
They just call it that.

1092
0:45:14 --> 0:45:16
And then if it's any of the regular AI, it's like,

1093
0:45:16 --> 0:45:18
it's like, would you like me to keep trying to slobbering up?

1094
0:45:18 --> 0:45:19
No, I came.

1095
0:45:19 --> 0:45:20
I'd like to go to bed now.

1096
0:45:20 --> 0:45:22
All right, would you like me to print out different techniques

1097
0:45:22 --> 0:45:24
I'd like to possibly do your wiener some other time?

1098
0:45:25 --> 0:45:26
That's a great idea you just had.

1099
0:45:27 --> 0:45:29
You're really smart things that you say.

1100
0:45:29 --> 0:45:30
No, would you like to?

1101
0:45:30 --> 0:45:32
If you want to tell you several jokes

1102
0:45:32 --> 0:45:34
about vaginas and magicians, you're a magician.

1103
0:45:35 --> 0:45:35
The AI vagina.

1104
0:45:36 --> 0:45:36
Actually, I would like that.

1105
0:45:37 --> 0:45:39
You put your dick in the AI vagina

1106
0:45:39 --> 0:45:40
and Will Smith is in there to fight it.

1107
0:45:43 --> 0:45:44
That's the AI vagina.

1108
0:45:46 --> 0:45:48
You could go down there.

1109
0:45:48 --> 0:45:50
And it's just like, oh, hell no.

1110
0:45:50 --> 0:45:51
Yeah, exactly.

1111
0:45:53 --> 0:45:57
Keep my AI vagina out of your mouth.

1112
0:46:07 --> 0:46:09
There is a whole help page here.

1113
0:46:10 --> 0:46:13
The dolls have like AI vagina.

1114
0:46:14 --> 0:46:14
Yes or no.

1115
0:46:15 --> 0:46:18
Nothing on this website says what that is, though.

1116
0:46:18 --> 0:46:21
Jacob, please look up the torso facts.

1117
0:46:22 --> 0:46:26
What are the frequently asked questions

1118
0:46:26 --> 0:46:27
about the robo torso?

1119
0:46:28 --> 0:46:30
Matt, do you have any?

1120
0:46:31 --> 0:46:33
I could just guess.

1121
0:46:37 --> 0:46:39
No frequently asked questions section

1122
0:46:39 --> 0:46:41
about the torso only dolls.

1123
0:46:42 --> 0:46:45
Okay, what are some of the frequently asked questions?

1124
0:46:45 --> 0:46:46
No questions.

1125
0:46:48 --> 0:46:52
Those men know what they want and they don't want to talk about it at all.

1126
0:46:52 --> 0:46:52
Just give me the torso and shut up, ship it.

1127
0:46:53 --> 0:46:54
Torso, please.

1128
0:46:54 --> 0:46:56
Torso, go.

1129
0:46:57 --> 0:46:57
Torso, engage.

1130
0:46:58 --> 0:46:58
Torso, fire.

1131
0:46:58 --> 0:47:02
There is a whole section on storage and maintenance, though.

1132
0:47:02 --> 0:47:02
Okay.

1133
0:47:03 --> 0:47:04
And the first question is,

1134
0:47:04 --> 0:47:06
the first frequently asked question is,

1135
0:47:06 --> 0:47:08
how do I style my doll's hair?

1136
0:47:09 --> 0:47:10
Oh, man.

1137
0:47:11 --> 0:47:12
I know.

1138
0:47:13 --> 0:47:13
I don't.

1139
0:47:14 --> 0:47:15
Couldn't you take it to a salon?

1140
0:47:16 --> 0:47:16
Sure.

1141
0:47:17 --> 0:47:19
Like, you know, like, like it's like,

1142
0:47:19 --> 0:47:20
I always talk about this with Donnie Marie.

1143
0:47:21 --> 0:47:22
It's like the fact that, like,

1144
0:47:22 --> 0:47:23
you make all these incest jokes about them.

1145
0:47:24 --> 0:47:25
That's not the part that grosses you out.

1146
0:47:25 --> 0:47:26
It's not the sexual tension.

1147
0:47:26 --> 0:47:28
It's when they're actually brother and sisterly,

1148
0:47:28 --> 0:47:29
that you're like, oh, this is weird.

1149
0:47:30 --> 0:47:30
Yeah.

1150
0:47:31 --> 0:47:32
These, these older adults being like

1151
0:47:32 --> 0:47:34
teasing brother and sister is so weird.

1152
0:47:35 --> 0:47:38
For instance, the actual most disturbing part

1153
0:47:38 --> 0:47:41
of the real doll website is the storage tips.

1154
0:47:42 --> 0:47:42
Right.

1155
0:47:42 --> 0:47:43
That's it.

1156
0:47:43 --> 0:47:44
It's, it's the X's and O's that are,

1157
0:47:45 --> 0:47:46
the sex parts are given.

1158
0:47:47 --> 0:47:49
But now it's the X's and O's.

1159
0:47:49 --> 0:47:51
Let me just read this sentence to you

1160
0:47:51 --> 0:47:54
and see if you can just contain yourself.

1161
0:47:54 --> 0:47:54
Okay.

1162
0:47:55 --> 0:47:57
For best maintenance of your doll,

1163
0:47:57 --> 0:48:01
it should preferably be stored hanging in a neutral position

1164
0:48:01 --> 0:48:06
with legs lightly spread from the provided neck bolt.

1165
0:48:08 --> 0:48:09
You hang the legs.

1166
0:48:10 --> 0:48:11
So you want to hang the doll by the neck bolt

1167
0:48:11 --> 0:48:13
with the legs slightly spread

1168
0:48:13 --> 0:48:16
so that things can dry out.

1169
0:48:18 --> 0:48:18
Yeah.

1170
0:48:19 --> 0:48:21
And make sure you remove the neck bolt

1171
0:48:21 --> 0:48:24
when you're using the doll or when it is lying down.

1172
0:48:25 --> 0:48:25
Okay.

1173
0:48:26 --> 0:48:28
And then it goes on to talk about avoiding creases

1174
0:48:28 --> 0:48:31
and the silicone as that can cause creases.

1175
0:48:32 --> 0:48:34
How much for just the neck bolt?

1176
0:48:36 --> 0:48:38
Neck bolt only.

1177
0:48:38 --> 0:48:39
Neck bolt only.

1178
0:48:40 --> 0:48:45
Hang your AI real doll by her neck bolt, please.

1179
0:48:45 --> 0:48:50
And I will see that you really love her.

1180
0:48:50 --> 0:48:52
Hang your real doll,

1181
0:48:52 --> 0:48:55
neck bolt in the closet for me.

1182
0:48:56 --> 0:48:57
Oh my God.

1183
0:48:57 --> 0:48:59
Yeah, that's a, it's a lot.

1184
0:48:59 --> 0:48:59
Oh no.

1185
0:49:00 --> 0:49:00
Some of them are out of shape.

1186
0:49:00 --> 0:49:00
Oh no.

1187
0:49:01 --> 0:49:02
Careful now, Jacob.

1188
0:49:02 --> 0:49:02
We're on.

1189
0:49:02 --> 0:49:03
Some of them are out of shape.

1190
0:49:03 --> 0:49:03
We're on.

1191
0:49:04 --> 0:49:06
I know that's why I showed you a picture of clothed ones.

1192
0:49:08 --> 0:49:12
I like the evergreen one because it's evergreen.

1193
0:49:12 --> 0:49:13
They're dressed for Christmas.

1194
0:49:13 --> 0:49:14
It's all seasonal.

1195
0:49:14 --> 0:49:16
They were holiday themed.

1196
0:49:16 --> 0:49:17
They are holiday themed.

1197
0:49:17 --> 0:49:19
That's like, I'm only a sick.

1198
0:49:19 --> 0:49:20
It's all a guy around the holidays.

1199
0:49:21 --> 0:49:23
I busted out with my tree and my,

1200
0:49:23 --> 0:49:24
Oh, I busted out all right.

1201
0:49:25 --> 0:49:29
I mean, it'd be a good way to just change up the conversations

1202
0:49:29 --> 0:49:30
when you're going home, right?

1203
0:49:31 --> 0:49:32
A real, a real doll.

1204
0:49:32 --> 0:49:33
Nobody's talking about anything else

1205
0:49:33 --> 0:49:35
except you bringing a real doll to Christmas.

1206
0:49:36 --> 0:49:37
Nobody's talking about politics.

1207
0:49:37 --> 0:49:37
Right?

1208
0:49:38 --> 0:49:39
I mean, politics is done.

1209
0:49:39 --> 0:49:42
It's just, it's fucking a mannequin.

1210
0:49:42 --> 0:49:44
I don't, I don't fuck that.

1211
0:49:44 --> 0:49:45
That goes on my front lawn.

1212
0:49:45 --> 0:49:46
That goes on my lawn.

1213
0:49:46 --> 0:49:46
Oh, sure.

1214
0:49:47 --> 0:49:49
It's, it's, it's holding up a penguin by the tree.

1215
0:49:50 --> 0:49:50
Okay.

1216
0:49:50 --> 0:49:51
I put it in the sleigh.

1217
0:49:53 --> 0:49:54
It's in my major sequence.

1218
0:49:55 --> 0:49:55
It's in my major.

1219
0:49:56 --> 0:49:56
It's my Mary.

1220
0:49:57 --> 0:49:58
This is my Mary from my major.

1221
0:50:00 --> 0:50:01
It's my Mary major scene.

1222
0:50:02 --> 0:50:03
I'm one of the wise men.

1223
0:50:03 --> 0:50:04
This is Mary.

1224
0:50:05 --> 0:50:07
We're out and about for the evening.

1225
0:50:08 --> 0:50:11
I'll tell you all this fucking Mary from a major scene

1226
0:50:11 --> 0:50:13
and that is the following sponsor.

1227
0:50:13 --> 0:50:17
Today's show is brought to you by Ru Paul Mattingly's

1228
0:50:17 --> 0:50:20
and Ru Paul Mattingly and the Masters of the Dragiverse.

1229
0:50:22 --> 0:50:24
Ru Paul Mattingly and the Masters of the Dragverse.

1230
0:50:27 --> 0:50:28
You better work.

1231
0:50:29 --> 0:50:30
I have the power.

1232
0:50:32 --> 0:50:33
Grace go.

1233
0:50:34 --> 0:50:36
Look, battle cat.

1234
0:50:37 --> 0:50:39
You need a makeover girl.

1235
0:50:39 --> 0:50:41
Whatever you got going on with that face.

1236
0:50:43 --> 0:50:44
It's not working.

1237
0:50:45 --> 0:50:47
And I have to tell it like it is.

1238
0:50:47 --> 0:50:50
You look worn out.

1239
0:50:50 --> 0:50:53
May I offer you my Ru apologies

1240
0:50:54 --> 0:50:59
and tell you that it's time to switch it up, up, up.

1241
0:51:00 --> 0:51:02
Come on out here, Shira.

1242
0:51:02 --> 0:51:03
My sister Adora.

1243
0:51:04 --> 0:51:05
She's going to give you some tips

1244
0:51:05 --> 0:51:07
on how to brighten your cheeks.

1245
0:51:07 --> 0:51:09
Hey man at arms.

1246
0:51:09 --> 0:51:10
Why don't you come over here

1247
0:51:10 --> 0:51:12
and fuck my real doll that you built me?

1248
0:51:12 --> 0:51:13
Show me how it works.

1249
0:51:16 --> 0:51:17
Do it.

1250
0:51:19 --> 0:51:21
Oh look.

1251
0:51:23 --> 0:51:26
It's special guest star Rachel Epithet.

1252
0:51:27 --> 0:51:29
Hey everybody, it's me.

1253
0:51:30 --> 0:51:34
Paul Mattingly's drag drag persona Rachel Epithet.

1254
0:51:35 --> 0:51:38
I hope everyone's having a wonderful holiday season.

1255
0:51:38 --> 0:51:42
Ru, thank you so much for continuing to do the work you do

1256
0:51:42 --> 0:51:45
and keeping the community fresh and fun

1257
0:51:45 --> 0:51:49
and putting the positive vibes out there for everyone.

1258
0:51:49 --> 0:51:52
Let's all have a Merry Christmas here on Eternia.

1259
0:51:54 --> 0:51:55
Ho, ho, ho.

1260
0:51:57 --> 0:51:58
Interhase groups to check out.

1261
0:51:58 --> 0:51:59
There you go.

1262
0:52:00 --> 0:52:01
That would be a good crossover.

1263
0:52:02 --> 0:52:02
Boy that new master's.

1264
0:52:02 --> 0:52:04
I found the stuff about the AI stuff.

1265
0:52:04 --> 0:52:06
That new master's, okay great.

1266
0:52:06 --> 0:52:07
Share it a second.

1267
0:52:07 --> 0:52:08
That new master's universe movie

1268
0:52:08 --> 0:52:10
is looking like it might be okay.

1269
0:52:11 --> 0:52:11
Dolph Lundgren.

1270
0:52:11 --> 0:52:15
No, I don't know if he might have a cameo in there or not.

1271
0:52:16 --> 0:52:21
I know Jared Leto is the one kind of flying the ointment

1272
0:52:21 --> 0:52:22
but they're saying-

1273
0:52:22 --> 0:52:23
He's Skeletor, right?

1274
0:52:23 --> 0:52:27
Yep, but they're saying it's getting fairly positive buzz so far.

1275
0:52:27 --> 0:52:27
All right.

1276
0:52:28 --> 0:52:28
We'll see.

1277
0:52:29 --> 0:52:29
Who knows?

1278
0:52:30 --> 0:52:31
Did he quit?

1279
0:52:31 --> 0:52:32
I don't think so.

1280
0:52:32 --> 0:52:33
All right, that would be the way to go,

1281
0:52:33 --> 0:52:35
Bossy, if he quit it would be the big positive buzz.

1282
0:52:36 --> 0:52:37
But no, I don't think so.

1283
0:52:37 --> 0:52:37
But we'll see.

1284
0:52:38 --> 0:52:41
All right, so explain to us AI vagina please.

1285
0:52:41 --> 0:52:50
Uh, according to this, oh boy, I would show you videos of it

1286
0:52:50 --> 0:52:51
but Twitch would ban us.

1287
0:52:52 --> 0:52:53
Well, don't be mad.

1288
0:52:53 --> 0:52:53
Twitch would just ban us.

1289
0:52:54 --> 0:52:56
Like the mouth movements and-

1290
0:52:56 --> 0:52:58
Come on, Twitch is just science.

1291
0:52:58 --> 0:52:59
Yeah, come on.

1292
0:53:00 --> 0:53:04
The thing, they move their mouths around but it's,

1293
0:53:04 --> 0:53:07
it looks like they're kind of, okay,

1294
0:53:08 --> 0:53:10
they don't look sexy when they're moving their mouth around.

1295
0:53:10 --> 0:53:14
They look like a crack addict.

1296
0:53:15 --> 0:53:18
They're moving their mouth around like they're grinding their teeth

1297
0:53:18 --> 0:53:20
because they've smoked too much crack.

1298
0:53:21 --> 0:53:25
In the, on the best day, would you trust a fake robot mouth with your dick?

1299
0:53:26 --> 0:53:26
Nope.

1300
0:53:27 --> 0:53:27
Me neither.

1301
0:53:28 --> 0:53:28
No.

1302
0:53:28 --> 0:53:29
Like what the fuck?

1303
0:53:30 --> 0:53:31
Like I can understand-

1304
0:53:31 --> 0:53:32
$11,000 for a dick of keen.

1305
0:53:32 --> 0:53:35
Like a simplified toy or something without-

1306
0:53:35 --> 0:53:36
You asked that question so backwards, Paul.

1307
0:53:37 --> 0:53:38
Okay, what's the question?

1308
0:53:38 --> 0:53:39
Ignorant you are.

1309
0:53:39 --> 0:53:40
All right, what's the question?

1310
0:53:40 --> 0:53:43
Would you like to have safe sex with a meth head?

1311
0:53:43 --> 0:53:45
That's the question you need to answer.

1312
0:53:48 --> 0:53:50
No is the answer.

1313
0:53:50 --> 0:53:53
No, I don't think there is safe sex with a meth head.

1314
0:53:53 --> 0:53:59
Don't worry, the head and mouth both contain safety mechanisms to lock the neck and mouth

1315
0:53:59 --> 0:54:03
in place when needed for posing or for rough play.

1316
0:54:03 --> 0:54:04
Oh no.

1317
0:54:05 --> 0:54:07
So don't worry about it, Paul.

1318
0:54:07 --> 0:54:09
It's all taken care of.

1319
0:54:09 --> 0:54:10
No, this doesn't-

1320
0:54:11 --> 0:54:16
I don't want the words rough play and my dick connected in the same sentence.

1321
0:54:17 --> 0:54:22
This is, this is some pen talking about permanent damage acceptable.

1322
0:54:23 --> 0:54:23
Shit.

1323
0:54:24 --> 0:54:24
No, thank you.

1324
0:54:25 --> 0:54:26
Permanent damage okay.

1325
0:54:27 --> 0:54:28
That was the phrase, right?

1326
0:54:28 --> 0:54:28
That's what it was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1327
0:54:28 --> 0:54:29
Jesus Christ.

1328
0:54:30 --> 0:54:31
I-

1329
0:54:31 --> 0:54:32
Permanent damage okay.

1330
0:54:32 --> 0:54:33
I mean how much of these things weigh?

1331
0:54:34 --> 0:54:35
This doesn't look like it's a lightweight thing.

1332
0:54:35 --> 0:54:39
I'm just imagining carrying this through the John Wick experience.

1333
0:54:41 --> 0:54:45
Yeah, that's, that's your, that's your, your gym time, I guess.

1334
0:54:45 --> 0:54:48
That maybe makes up for it a little bit that you don't have to go to the gym that day.

1335
0:54:48 --> 0:54:52
I guess, like I can't find just a, I just want a weight of what all these things are.

1336
0:54:53 --> 0:54:54
And they can't be nothing.

1337
0:54:54 --> 0:54:55
That's really terrifying.

1338
0:54:56 --> 0:54:56
All of it's terrifying.

1339
0:54:57 --> 0:54:58
Yep.

1340
0:54:59 --> 0:55:02
Oh, the AI vagina looks like it's basically just a flashlight with a little

1341
0:55:02 --> 0:55:06
motor type thing in there so it can, it can move around a little bit.

1342
0:55:06 --> 0:55:11
And the reason they call them AI is because you can like plug it into some software that will

1343
0:55:13 --> 0:55:18
quote unquote sync up with something you're watching on TV or-

1344
0:55:18 --> 0:55:18
Oh, okay.

1345
0:55:18 --> 0:55:19
Right.

1346
0:55:19 --> 0:55:26
Like stuff like that, like it'll, it'll do that or, or it can be remotely controlled by some

1347
0:55:26 --> 0:55:30
operator somewhere so you don't have say on to how it's jerking your ween-

1348
0:55:30 --> 0:55:31
We've got a Patreon level for that.

1349
0:55:32 --> 0:55:32
I mean, absolutely.

1350
0:55:33 --> 0:55:35
And I think it's like, we keep waiting for the moment

1351
0:55:35 --> 0:55:38
we're going to declare that AI has gained its own consciousness.

1352
0:55:38 --> 0:55:41
And I think it'd be funny if it starts with the robot vaginas first.

1353
0:55:42 --> 0:55:45
Well, I mean, I feel like that would not be good for us.

1354
0:55:45 --> 0:55:47
Bossy is dead on here.

1355
0:55:47 --> 0:55:49
You know, porn is always the forward part in tech.

1356
0:55:49 --> 0:55:51
He's looking forward to the torn dick horror stories.

1357
0:55:53 --> 0:55:54
I'm with you.

1358
0:55:54 --> 0:55:55
But it's absolutely right.

1359
0:55:56 --> 0:56:00
You, you, from the days of the printing press, you want to know where technology is going.

1360
0:56:01 --> 0:56:05
What technology allows the dissemination of porn most easily?

1361
0:56:05 --> 0:56:06
And cheaply.

1362
0:56:06 --> 0:56:08
That is where tech is going.

1363
0:56:08 --> 0:56:11
That was what won the VHS beta war.

1364
0:56:12 --> 0:56:13
It's a lot of things.

1365
0:56:13 --> 0:56:13
Yeah.

1366
0:56:14 --> 0:56:17
If, if that's a weird thing with streaming.

1367
0:56:17 --> 0:56:20
Are we racing to the first AI sex spot?

1368
0:56:20 --> 0:56:20
The cheapest one?

1369
0:56:21 --> 0:56:22
Is that what we're going to figure out?

1370
0:56:23 --> 0:56:23
Yeah.

1371
0:56:24 --> 0:56:25
Seems like a good way to become billionaires, guys.

1372
0:56:26 --> 0:56:26
We figured.

1373
0:56:28 --> 0:56:29
Excuse me.

1374
0:56:29 --> 0:56:30
I have to, I have to leave right now.

1375
0:56:31 --> 0:56:31
And you know what they say?

1376
0:56:32 --> 0:56:35
Build a better cock trap and the world will beat off to your door.

1377
0:56:36 --> 0:56:38
They do say that.

1378
0:56:39 --> 0:56:40
That is true, Paul.

1379
0:56:40 --> 0:56:43
They do, they do say that.

1380
0:56:43 --> 0:56:45
Is that Willy Wonka or Ben Franklin?

1381
0:56:46 --> 0:56:46
Who said that?

1382
0:56:46 --> 0:56:49
That was, that was a Franklin Bon Mott right there.

1383
0:56:50 --> 0:56:55
Well, that's one piece of information that Paul has,

1384
0:56:55 --> 0:56:56
but he probably doesn't have any others.

1385
0:56:56 --> 0:56:58
So he's going to lose a jock versus nerd.

1386
0:56:59 --> 0:56:59
Okay.

1387
0:57:01 --> 0:57:06
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1388
0:57:24 --> 0:57:27
Of real dolls and AI vaginas.

1389
0:57:28 --> 0:57:31
We got a scoop and he coming to us from Smitty Scoop.

1390
0:57:32 --> 0:57:35
The categories are potsylvania, geography,

1391
0:57:35 --> 0:57:37
potpourri, and second chance.

1392
0:57:38 --> 0:57:41
Smitty, you sent an email along with this that I already lost.

1393
0:57:41 --> 0:57:42
Don't worry about that.

1394
0:57:43 --> 0:57:45
Basically, we're all real close for the year.

1395
0:57:45 --> 0:57:48
We're all real close on the Smitty stats for the year.

1396
0:57:48 --> 0:57:50
It's any of our games for the year.

1397
0:57:50 --> 0:57:51
It's me first.

1398
0:57:51 --> 0:57:53
I'll try potpourri 400.

1399
0:57:54 --> 0:57:58
Richard Hager of Wichita Falls, Texas was just certified

1400
0:57:58 --> 0:58:01
by Dennis as the oldest bus driver in the world.

1401
0:58:01 --> 0:58:02
How old is he?

1402
0:58:03 --> 0:58:05
85, 95, 105, or 115?

1403
0:58:07 --> 0:58:09
Oldest bus driver.

1404
0:58:10 --> 0:58:11
I bet he's 95.

1405
0:58:12 --> 0:58:12
Let's say 95.

1406
0:58:13 --> 0:58:13
Good guess.

1407
0:58:14 --> 0:58:15
It is 95.

1408
0:58:15 --> 0:58:17
He said he planned to retire at 95,

1409
0:58:17 --> 0:58:18
but now he plans to just keep driving

1410
0:58:18 --> 0:58:20
for as long as he remains healthy and able,

1411
0:58:20 --> 0:58:23
which definitely is not an indication

1412
0:58:23 --> 0:58:26
of how our retirement system is going in this country.

1413
0:58:26 --> 0:58:27
Paul.

1414
0:58:27 --> 0:58:28
America is a horror show.

1415
0:58:29 --> 0:58:30
Second chance for 400.

1416
0:58:31 --> 0:58:33
What is the nickname of professional

1417
0:58:33 --> 0:58:36
dart player Tim Pusey that he has barred

1418
0:58:36 --> 0:58:38
from using during the 2025 World DART

1419
0:58:38 --> 0:58:41
Championships by the PDC?

1420
0:58:41 --> 0:58:43
What was Tim Pusey's nickname?

1421
0:58:44 --> 0:58:45
This is a second chance question.

1422
0:58:45 --> 0:58:46
We got it wrong before.

1423
0:58:48 --> 0:58:50
A.I. Pusey.

1424
0:58:56 --> 0:58:57
Crisco Pusey.

1425
0:58:57 --> 0:58:58
It's not Gary.

1426
0:58:58 --> 0:59:00
I'll pass because I cannot remember what this was.

1427
0:59:01 --> 0:59:02
That passes the map.

1428
0:59:02 --> 0:59:03
I forget.

1429
0:59:04 --> 0:59:04
It's not Gary.

1430
0:59:04 --> 0:59:05
It's not Gary Pusey.

1431
0:59:05 --> 0:59:07
It's not Gary Pusey.

1432
0:59:07 --> 0:59:08
That's what it should be.

1433
0:59:08 --> 0:59:09
No, I'll pass.

1434
0:59:09 --> 0:59:11
It passes to me.

1435
0:59:11 --> 0:59:14
It's something like the destroyer or something,

1436
0:59:14 --> 0:59:15
but I don't remember what it was.

1437
0:59:15 --> 0:59:15
I'll pass.

1438
0:59:15 --> 0:59:16
The Pusey destroyer?

1439
0:59:16 --> 0:59:17
The Pusey destroyer or something.

1440
0:59:19 --> 0:59:19
Magnet.

1441
0:59:20 --> 0:59:21
It was Pusey Magnet.

1442
0:59:21 --> 0:59:21
That's right.

1443
0:59:21 --> 0:59:22
The Tim Pusey Magnet.

1444
0:59:22 --> 0:59:22
Yep.

1445
0:59:23 --> 0:59:24
Previous best guesses.

1446
0:59:25 --> 0:59:27
Gary, dry, dirty, smack that,

1447
0:59:27 --> 0:59:30
grab them by the super tight and 70s bush.

1448
0:59:31 --> 0:59:34
We had some great conversations last time.

1449
0:59:35 --> 0:59:37
Boy, we were funny before.

1450
0:59:37 --> 0:59:38
I was going to say this podcast

1451
0:59:38 --> 0:59:39
used to be funny.

1452
0:59:39 --> 0:59:39
What happened?

1453
0:59:40 --> 0:59:40
Fuck.

1454
0:59:41 --> 0:59:43
We were replaced by AI vaginas.

1455
0:59:43 --> 0:59:44
Oh, no.

1456
0:59:44 --> 0:59:45
They found us out.

1457
0:59:46 --> 0:59:48
My AI mouth is hungry for wieners.

1458
0:59:51 --> 0:59:53
I'll go Pupery 800, please.

1459
0:59:55 --> 0:59:56
Episode 1264,

1460
0:59:56 --> 0:59:59
fill in the blank on this Jacob quote.

1461
0:59:59 --> 1:00:02
If we can get a Paul Mattingly blank shirt in time,

1462
1:00:03 --> 1:00:04
that will be our Black Friday sale.

1463
1:00:07 --> 1:00:09
Oh, gosh, that could be anything.

1464
1:00:09 --> 1:00:10
Really good.

1465
1:00:11 --> 1:00:13
Probably Paul Mattingly was wrong, right?

1466
1:00:14 --> 1:00:16
I think it was wrong or was right.

1467
1:00:17 --> 1:00:18
I don't know.

1468
1:00:18 --> 1:00:20
He's not going to promote it with Paul Mattingly's right shirt.

1469
1:00:22 --> 1:00:23
Come on.

1470
1:00:24 --> 1:00:26
Car is the guest in the chat.

1471
1:00:31 --> 1:00:33
I'm going to pass.

1472
1:00:34 --> 1:00:34
All right.

1473
1:00:35 --> 1:00:35
Oh, that passes to me.

1474
1:00:36 --> 1:00:36
I have no idea.

1475
1:00:36 --> 1:00:37
I'm passing.

1476
1:00:37 --> 1:00:39
I'll guess Paul Mattingly was wrong.

1477
1:00:40 --> 1:00:40
All right.

1478
1:00:42 --> 1:00:43
Ride the devil.

1479
1:00:44 --> 1:00:47
Paul Mattingly ride the devil's shirt.

1480
1:00:47 --> 1:00:48
I don't know what that's about,

1481
1:00:48 --> 1:00:49
but I like the idea of it.

1482
1:00:51 --> 1:00:52
Oh, it's me.

1483
1:00:52 --> 1:00:55
I'll try Potsylvania 400.

1484
1:00:55 --> 1:00:57
Can't believe we blew our Black Friday sale.

1485
1:00:57 --> 1:00:58
I know.

1486
1:00:59 --> 1:01:00
Yingling, America's oldest brewery

1487
1:01:00 --> 1:01:02
and the largest wholly owned brewery in America,

1488
1:01:04 --> 1:01:06
probably, is based in what city?

1489
1:01:06 --> 1:01:08
Potsville, Pots town, Potsville.

1490
1:01:10 --> 1:01:11
All right.

1491
1:01:13 --> 1:01:15
Pots, isn't it?

1492
1:01:15 --> 1:01:16
I think it's Pennsylvania.

1493
1:01:16 --> 1:01:17
It is.

1494
1:01:17 --> 1:01:19
Pots them, Pennsylvania, Pots town,

1495
1:01:19 --> 1:01:20
Pennsylvania, Potsville, Pennsylvania.

1496
1:01:21 --> 1:01:23
I think they're all places, but you know.

1497
1:01:23 --> 1:01:25
It seems like it would be.

1498
1:01:26 --> 1:01:27
I'll try Potsville.

1499
1:01:27 --> 1:01:28
C, Potsville.

1500
1:01:29 --> 1:01:30
It is Potsville.

1501
1:01:30 --> 1:01:31
Potsville.

1502
1:01:31 --> 1:01:31
All right.

1503
1:01:31 --> 1:01:32
Look at that.

1504
1:01:32 --> 1:01:32
All right.

1505
1:01:33 --> 1:01:34
Paul.

1506
1:01:35 --> 1:01:36
Oh, God.

1507
1:01:37 --> 1:01:38
Popery for 2000.

1508
1:01:39 --> 1:01:39
All right.

1509
1:01:40 --> 1:01:42
What Dutch Caribbean island just became

1510
1:01:42 --> 1:01:44
the least populous nation to qualify

1511
1:01:44 --> 1:01:46
for the FIFA World Cup?

1512
1:01:46 --> 1:01:51
Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, or St. Martin?

1513
1:01:54 --> 1:01:55
I'll go with D, St. Martin.

1514
1:01:56 --> 1:01:56
Nope.

1515
1:01:56 --> 1:01:57
Let's try it.

1516
1:01:57 --> 1:01:58
I'm sorry.

1517
1:01:58 --> 1:02:00
It's Curacao with a population of 156,000.

1518
1:02:01 --> 1:02:02
It surpassed Iceland 391,000

1519
1:02:02 --> 1:02:05
as the least populous World Cup qualifier.

1520
1:02:09 --> 1:02:09
Matt, you're up.

1521
1:02:09 --> 1:02:09
Curacao.

1522
1:02:10 --> 1:02:11
I knew that one.

1523
1:02:11 --> 1:02:13
But now I got to go to stuff I don't know.

1524
1:02:15 --> 1:02:16
You're used to that.

1525
1:02:16 --> 1:02:17
Let's go.

1526
1:02:18 --> 1:02:19
I'm already down.

1527
1:02:19 --> 1:02:20
I'm down to Jacob there.

1528
1:02:21 --> 1:02:22
Popery 1200, please.

1529
1:02:23 --> 1:02:24
Let's try it.

1530
1:02:25 --> 1:02:27
What is the actual name of the politicians

1531
1:02:27 --> 1:02:31
serving their third term as the treasurer of Alabama?

1532
1:02:31 --> 1:02:32
Dick Hickey.

1533
1:02:33 --> 1:02:34
Frost Bush.

1534
1:02:34 --> 1:02:37
Harry Bulse or Young Boozer?

1535
1:02:39 --> 1:02:42
That's Harry Bulse, B-A-A-L-S.

1536
1:02:42 --> 1:02:43
Harry Bulse.

1537
1:02:45 --> 1:02:46
Dick Hickey sounds right to me.

1538
1:02:46 --> 1:02:48
I was going to say, I'm going to go A, Dick Hickey.

1539
1:02:48 --> 1:02:50
I grew up with some Hickeys as a kid.

1540
1:02:51 --> 1:02:52
I'm sorry, it's Young Boozer.

1541
1:02:52 --> 1:02:53
Young Boozer.

1542
1:02:53 --> 1:02:55
I went to college with Frost Bush

1543
1:02:55 --> 1:02:57
and grade school friend with Kevin Hickey.

1544
1:02:58 --> 1:03:00
He had a father named Dick.

1545
1:03:00 --> 1:03:02
That's who I was thinking of.

1546
1:03:02 --> 1:03:05
Yeah, you were thinking of Smitty's friend's dad.

1547
1:03:05 --> 1:03:07
The wrong Dick Hickey.

1548
1:03:07 --> 1:03:08
Yep.

1549
1:03:09 --> 1:03:09
It's me.

1550
1:03:10 --> 1:03:12
By the way, if you want your Dick Hickey,

1551
1:03:12 --> 1:03:14
leave a permanent mark here to hang it up by the neck bone.

1552
1:03:16 --> 1:03:18
You got to leave it spread to dry out a little bit.

1553
1:03:21 --> 1:03:21
Terrible.

1554
1:03:21 --> 1:03:22
That's just terrible.

1555
1:03:22 --> 1:03:23
I'll try geography for 400.

1556
1:03:24 --> 1:03:27
Name any of, name any four of the 10 countries

1557
1:03:27 --> 1:03:30
that have four letter names when written in English.

1558
1:03:32 --> 1:03:34
Oh, God.

1559
1:03:34 --> 1:03:34
Canada, Canada.

1560
1:03:35 --> 1:03:36
Wait, no.

1561
1:03:36 --> 1:03:36
Canada.

1562
1:03:37 --> 1:03:38
Canada.

1563
1:03:38 --> 1:03:38
Japan.

1564
1:03:38 --> 1:03:39
C-A-D-A.

1565
1:03:39 --> 1:03:39
Canada.

1566
1:03:40 --> 1:03:41
Damn it.

1567
1:03:43 --> 1:03:43
Iceland.

1568
1:03:46 --> 1:03:47
Uruguay.

1569
1:03:47 --> 1:03:48
Chad is one.

1570
1:03:49 --> 1:03:49
Chad.

1571
1:03:50 --> 1:03:52
The safety lad.

1572
1:03:53 --> 1:03:55
You got two in the Middle East.

1573
1:03:59 --> 1:03:59
Oh, yeah.

1574
1:03:59 --> 1:04:01
How many letters does Qatar have?

1575
1:04:01 --> 1:04:02
That's five.

1576
1:04:03 --> 1:04:03
Is that five letters?

1577
1:04:05 --> 1:04:06
Iraq.

1578
1:04:06 --> 1:04:07
Oh, my Qatar.

1579
1:04:08 --> 1:04:08
There you go.

1580
1:04:08 --> 1:04:10
Chad Lewee.

1581
1:04:10 --> 1:04:11
Iraq, Iran, Chad.

1582
1:04:15 --> 1:04:16
And Egypt is five letters.

1583
1:04:18 --> 1:04:20
Man, I can think of a lot of countries with five letters.

1584
1:04:23 --> 1:04:24
Um, I give up.

1585
1:04:25 --> 1:04:25
I pass.

1586
1:04:26 --> 1:04:26
I don't know.

1587
1:04:27 --> 1:04:27
Matt.

1588
1:04:28 --> 1:04:28
Oh, I don't think this would come around.

1589
1:04:29 --> 1:04:29
Okay.

1590
1:04:29 --> 1:04:30
Iraq, Iran, Chad.

1591
1:04:30 --> 1:04:31
I kind of come up with another one.

1592
1:04:32 --> 1:04:33
You don't got it.

1593
1:04:33 --> 1:04:34
That's what I thought too.

1594
1:04:34 --> 1:04:35
And then I didn't.

1595
1:04:35 --> 1:04:35
That's where I passed.

1596
1:04:36 --> 1:04:36
That's where we're at.

1597
1:04:36 --> 1:04:36
Yeah.

1598
1:04:38 --> 1:04:40
Now, but I got this.

1599
1:04:40 --> 1:04:40
I got this.

1600
1:04:40 --> 1:04:41
Here you got it, buddy.

1601
1:04:42 --> 1:04:42
You got it.

1602
1:04:43 --> 1:04:45
Let's just sit in silence while Matt thinks about the sense.

1603
1:04:46 --> 1:04:47
The country of spot.

1604
1:04:47 --> 1:04:50
Ty, I don't know if there's a land at the end of that one.

1605
1:04:55 --> 1:04:56
Oh, shit.

1606
1:04:56 --> 1:04:56
Pass.

1607
1:04:57 --> 1:04:58
This would all work.

1608
1:04:59 --> 1:04:59
Let's see.

1609
1:05:00 --> 1:05:01
Uh, Chad.

1610
1:05:01 --> 1:05:05
Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Iraq, Laos.

1611
1:05:05 --> 1:05:10
Uh, Mali, Oman, Peru, and Togo.

1612
1:05:12 --> 1:05:13
Duke of Togo.

1613
1:05:13 --> 1:05:15
That's the name of Galvo 13.

1614
1:05:15 --> 1:05:16
We've figured out three of them collectively and just quit.

1615
1:05:17 --> 1:05:17
Paul, you're up.

1616
1:05:18 --> 1:05:19
Uh, I will try.

1617
1:05:20 --> 1:05:24
Oh, God, I hate all these.

1618
1:05:24 --> 1:05:26
Pennsylvania Geography or Second Chance.

1619
1:05:27 --> 1:05:28
I'll do Second Chance for 2000.

1620
1:05:28 --> 1:05:30
Let's just fucking shoot the moon.

1621
1:05:30 --> 1:05:31
Name the song.

1622
1:05:31 --> 1:05:36
You consider me the young apprentice caught between the cilia

1623
1:05:36 --> 1:05:40
and garbage hypnotized by you.

1624
1:05:40 --> 1:05:42
If I should linger staring at the ring around your finger,

1625
1:05:42 --> 1:05:44
I have only come here seeking knowledge,

1626
1:05:44 --> 1:05:47
things they would not teach me in college.

1627
1:05:48 --> 1:05:48
Pass.

1628
1:05:49 --> 1:05:50
Matt.

1629
1:05:50 --> 1:05:50
Pass.

1630
1:05:51 --> 1:05:52
I'm passing too.

1631
1:05:55 --> 1:05:56
Police wrapped around your finger.

1632
1:05:57 --> 1:05:58
Oh, police.

1633
1:05:59 --> 1:06:00
I don't remember being asked that question before.

1634
1:06:00 --> 1:06:02
I do remember the question,

1635
1:06:02 --> 1:06:04
and I also remember I fucking got it wrong.

1636
1:06:05 --> 1:06:06
Matt, you're up.

1637
1:06:08 --> 1:06:10
I got to make a move here, guys.

1638
1:06:10 --> 1:06:10
Let's see.

1639
1:06:11 --> 1:06:11
Score check.

1640
1:06:11 --> 1:06:12
I have 800.

1641
1:06:12 --> 1:06:13
Matt has negative 1200.

1642
1:06:13 --> 1:06:15
Paul has negative 2800.

1643
1:06:15 --> 1:06:18
I think there's two scooperies left.

1644
1:06:18 --> 1:06:19
I think both of them are out there.

1645
1:06:19 --> 1:06:20
Two double dares.

1646
1:06:20 --> 1:06:20
Daily doubles, rather.

1647
1:06:21 --> 1:06:22
Double dares.

1648
1:06:22 --> 1:06:22
Two daily doubles.

1649
1:06:22 --> 1:06:24
Listen to me playing the wrong game.

1650
1:06:25 --> 1:06:26
That's right.

1651
1:06:26 --> 1:06:26
Mark Summers.

1652
1:06:27 --> 1:06:29
You can get the old come past the red line.

1653
1:06:29 --> 1:06:29
You win.

1654
1:06:31 --> 1:06:31
That's right.

1655
1:06:31 --> 1:06:33
I could not remember that police song,

1656
1:06:33 --> 1:06:36
but I can remember Mark Summers' name from double dare.

1657
1:06:36 --> 1:06:37
No, no.

1658
1:06:37 --> 1:06:39
Okay, God damn it.

1659
1:06:41 --> 1:06:42
I'm terrible at all these categories.

1660
1:06:43 --> 1:06:45
I'll go Pennsylvania 2000.

1661
1:06:46 --> 1:06:46
All right.

1662
1:06:47 --> 1:06:49
Which city was the home of the Maroons,

1663
1:06:49 --> 1:06:51
a professional football team that was denied

1664
1:06:51 --> 1:06:55
the 1925 NFL championship due to a controversial suspension

1665
1:06:55 --> 1:06:58
for playing an exhibition game against Notre Dame,

1666
1:06:58 --> 1:07:01
Potsdam, Potstown or Potsville?

1667
1:07:03 --> 1:07:06
I'll go with Potsdam A.

1668
1:07:07 --> 1:07:07
Potsdam.

1669
1:07:11 --> 1:07:12
I'm sorry.

1670
1:07:12 --> 1:07:14
It's Potsville in 1993.

1671
1:07:15 --> 1:07:17
Isn't it always purchased the Cardinals

1672
1:07:17 --> 1:07:20
and began claiming the 1925 NFL championship

1673
1:07:20 --> 1:07:21
and fighting any attempts to recognize

1674
1:07:21 --> 1:07:25
the Potsville Maroons 1925 NFL championship.

1675
1:07:26 --> 1:07:29
Is that where the what a maroon phrase came from?

1676
1:07:29 --> 1:07:30
Maybe.

1677
1:07:30 --> 1:07:31
Let's say yes.

1678
1:07:31 --> 1:07:32
All right.

1679
1:07:32 --> 1:07:33
As far as I know it is.

1680
1:07:34 --> 1:07:34
Okay.

1681
1:07:34 --> 1:07:35
That's me.

1682
1:07:35 --> 1:07:37
I'll try a geography 800.

1683
1:07:38 --> 1:07:40
North Carolina is the closest point of land

1684
1:07:40 --> 1:07:43
to what British overseas territory,

1685
1:07:43 --> 1:07:48
which is an archipelago consisting of 181 islands.

1686
1:07:52 --> 1:07:54
Is that the Virgin Islands?

1687
1:07:56 --> 1:07:57
I don't know.

1688
1:07:57 --> 1:07:57
Virgin Islands.

1689
1:07:59 --> 1:08:00
Oh, Bermuda.

1690
1:08:01 --> 1:08:01
Bermuda.

1691
1:08:02 --> 1:08:02
Bama.

1692
1:08:02 --> 1:08:03
Bermuda is 181 islands?

1693
1:08:04 --> 1:08:04
Apparently.

1694
1:08:05 --> 1:08:06
I'm just learning that too.

1695
1:08:06 --> 1:08:07
Paul, you're up.

1696
1:08:08 --> 1:08:09
Second chance for 1200.

1697
1:08:14 --> 1:08:15
Yes.

1698
1:08:16 --> 1:08:17
Let's go into the fire.

1699
1:08:18 --> 1:08:19
Name this song.

1700
1:08:20 --> 1:08:23
So she tells him she must go out for the evening

1701
1:08:23 --> 1:08:25
to comfort an old friend who's feeling down.

1702
1:08:25 --> 1:08:28
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving.

1703
1:08:29 --> 1:08:30
She's heading for the cheating side of town.

1704
1:08:31 --> 1:08:31
Hint.

1705
1:08:31 --> 1:08:32
It's not Ruby.

1706
1:08:40 --> 1:08:40
Amethyst.

1707
1:08:41 --> 1:08:41
No.

1708
1:08:42 --> 1:08:46
Was this, this wasn't Jolene.

1709
1:08:48 --> 1:08:49
Jolene.

1710
1:08:49 --> 1:08:50
Jolene.

1711
1:08:50 --> 1:08:51
Jolene.

1712
1:08:52 --> 1:08:53
Jolene.

1713
1:08:56 --> 1:08:57
I'll try Jolene.

1714
1:08:57 --> 1:08:58
I'll try Jolene.

1715
1:08:59 --> 1:08:59
Let's try Jolene.

1716
1:09:00 --> 1:09:02
Lion eyes.

1717
1:09:02 --> 1:09:02
The Eagles.

1718
1:09:03 --> 1:09:04
Lion eyes.

1719
1:09:05 --> 1:09:05
Oh, the Eagles.

1720
1:09:06 --> 1:09:07
Jolene of the music world.

1721
1:09:08 --> 1:09:08
Sure.

1722
1:09:08 --> 1:09:08
Matt.

1723
1:09:09 --> 1:09:10
Um.

1724
1:09:11 --> 1:09:14
Jigam's running away with this.

1725
1:09:14 --> 1:09:17
Running away with this with zero points.

1726
1:09:17 --> 1:09:20
I have zero points and a commanding lead.

1727
1:09:23 --> 1:09:24
Geography please.

1728
1:09:25 --> 1:09:26
For 1200.

1729
1:09:26 --> 1:09:29
Name the four US states that meet at the four

1730
1:09:29 --> 1:09:29
corners monument.

1731
1:09:30 --> 1:09:31
The only quadra point in the USA.

1732
1:09:32 --> 1:09:33
Oh, I've done this before.

1733
1:09:34 --> 1:09:34
Yep.

1734
1:09:36 --> 1:09:37
And I forget.

1735
1:09:38 --> 1:09:38
Yep.

1736
1:09:42 --> 1:09:42
Idaho.

1737
1:09:43 --> 1:09:44
Montana.

1738
1:09:45 --> 1:09:45
It's not Montana.

1739
1:09:45 --> 1:09:47
I think it's I think it's Nebraska.

1740
1:09:48 --> 1:09:49
There it is.

1741
1:09:49 --> 1:09:50
Italy.

1742
1:09:50 --> 1:09:51
Yep.

1743
1:09:51 --> 1:09:52
I think that's it.

1744
1:09:53 --> 1:09:54
Venice.

1745
1:09:54 --> 1:09:56
Venice is the fifth one that nobody talks about.

1746
1:09:57 --> 1:10:00
Is it Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho?

1747
1:10:01 --> 1:10:02
Is Nevada one of them?

1748
1:10:03 --> 1:10:04
Maybe I'm wrong.

1749
1:10:05 --> 1:10:05
All right.

1750
1:10:05 --> 1:10:05
Pass.

1751
1:10:06 --> 1:10:07
Oh, I'm passing.

1752
1:10:07 --> 1:10:08
Paul.

1753
1:10:08 --> 1:10:09
Pass, a Rooney.

1754
1:10:09 --> 1:10:10
Let's see.

1755
1:10:11 --> 1:10:12
Clockwise from top left.

1756
1:10:12 --> 1:10:15
Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona.

1757
1:10:15 --> 1:10:18
All right then.

1758
1:10:20 --> 1:10:20
All right.

1759
1:10:20 --> 1:10:22
I've just clicked off that screen.

1760
1:10:22 --> 1:10:24
Can either of you two name the four

1761
1:10:24 --> 1:10:26
states that are in the four corners?

1762
1:10:28 --> 1:10:30
Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho.

1763
1:10:31 --> 1:10:32
I think that must be correct.

1764
1:10:33 --> 1:10:33
It's me.

1765
1:10:34 --> 1:10:35
I'll try geography for 2000.

1766
1:10:35 --> 1:10:35
It wasn't right.

1767
1:10:36 --> 1:10:36
I got it wrong.

1768
1:10:37 --> 1:10:40
On 11, 25, 20, 25, the UN announced

1769
1:10:40 --> 1:10:42
that what city had just passed Tokyo

1770
1:10:42 --> 1:10:43
to become the most populous city slash

1771
1:10:43 --> 1:10:45
metro area in the world.

1772
1:10:46 --> 1:10:48
Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jakarta, Indonesia,

1773
1:10:49 --> 1:10:52
New Delhi, India, or Shanghai, China.

1774
1:10:54 --> 1:10:56
I mean, those all seem like they could be it.

1775
1:10:56 --> 1:10:57
Yeah, they do.

1776
1:10:57 --> 1:10:59
Oh, this was just a few days ago.

1777
1:11:00 --> 1:11:02
I have no idea that I passed.

1778
1:11:03 --> 1:11:07
I will guess Bangladesh.

1779
1:11:08 --> 1:11:09
Let's try it.

1780
1:11:09 --> 1:11:09
Hey.

1781
1:11:12 --> 1:11:14
Jakarta, Jakarta, 42 million.

1782
1:11:15 --> 1:11:16
Jakarta.

1783
1:11:16 --> 1:11:18
Dhaka, 37 million.

1784
1:11:18 --> 1:11:20
New Delhi, 30 million.

1785
1:11:20 --> 1:11:21
And Shanghai, 30 million.

1786
1:11:23 --> 1:11:23
Close.

1787
1:11:23 --> 1:11:24
Paul, you're up.

1788
1:11:24 --> 1:11:26
You got Pennsylvania or Second Chance?

1789
1:11:26 --> 1:11:27
Second Chance, baby.

1790
1:11:27 --> 1:11:28
Let's keep going.

1791
1:11:28 --> 1:11:29
For 800.

1792
1:11:29 --> 1:11:30
It's another daily double.

1793
1:11:30 --> 1:11:30
Stop it.

1794
1:11:31 --> 1:11:33
Stop all the engines.

1795
1:11:33 --> 1:11:35
Which of the Golden Girls actors

1796
1:11:35 --> 1:11:37
had the most husbands?

1797
1:11:37 --> 1:11:39
B. Arthur, Betty White, Estelle Getty,

1798
1:11:39 --> 1:11:40
or Ruma Clanahan?

1799
1:11:40 --> 1:11:41
I believe it was B. Arthur.

1800
1:11:42 --> 1:11:43
I don't think it was.

1801
1:11:45 --> 1:11:45
Nope.

1802
1:11:45 --> 1:11:46
It's Ruma Clanahan.

1803
1:11:46 --> 1:11:47
It really was Ruma Clanahan.

1804
1:11:48 --> 1:11:48
Shit.

1805
1:11:48 --> 1:11:54
Matt, you got Pennsylvania for 800 or 1200.

1806
1:11:55 --> 1:11:55
What would you like?

1807
1:11:56 --> 1:11:57
Well, I'm I'm firmly in second.

1808
1:11:58 --> 1:11:59
You are.

1809
1:11:59 --> 1:12:01
I love that I got all the ones wrong before again.

1810
1:12:02 --> 1:12:04
I'll do Pennsylvania 1200.

1811
1:12:05 --> 1:12:05
Learning nothing.

1812
1:12:06 --> 1:12:07
Which of the following cities

1813
1:12:07 --> 1:12:09
is not actually located in Pennsylvania,

1814
1:12:09 --> 1:12:11
but instead is in New York

1815
1:12:11 --> 1:12:13
and is the home of a sunny school,

1816
1:12:13 --> 1:12:15
S-U-N-Y school?

1817
1:12:15 --> 1:12:15
Susie.

1818
1:12:15 --> 1:12:16
That post them.

1819
1:12:16 --> 1:12:17
SUNY school.

1820
1:12:17 --> 1:12:18
Post them.

1821
1:12:18 --> 1:12:19
Pots town or Potsville?

1822
1:12:21 --> 1:12:22
Let's go Pots them.

1823
1:12:23 --> 1:12:23
Pots them.

1824
1:12:23 --> 1:12:25
A is correct.

1825
1:12:26 --> 1:12:27
There we go.

1826
1:12:27 --> 1:12:29
We're going to click on one of these buttons

1827
1:12:29 --> 1:12:30
that says somebody got it right.

1828
1:12:30 --> 1:12:31
That's a fun change.

1829
1:12:32 --> 1:12:34
And I'm closing out the category

1830
1:12:34 --> 1:12:36
and the game Potsylvania for 800.

1831
1:12:36 --> 1:12:38
Jacob, this is for positive points.

1832
1:12:38 --> 1:12:38
It's high stakes.

1833
1:12:38 --> 1:12:41
This is this is only for positive points.

1834
1:12:41 --> 1:12:42
The Hill School

1835
1:12:42 --> 1:12:44
an elite college prep boarding school

1836
1:12:44 --> 1:12:46
is located in which city?

1837
1:12:47 --> 1:12:47
Pots them.

1838
1:12:47 --> 1:12:49
Pots town or Potsville?

1839
1:12:50 --> 1:12:51
I mean, I got to guess.

1840
1:12:51 --> 1:12:52
I got to, I got to guess one.

1841
1:12:52 --> 1:12:54
I'm going to say B Pots town.

1842
1:12:54 --> 1:12:56
I think that's the only one we haven't used.

1843
1:12:56 --> 1:13:01
It is Pots town and I have positive points

1844
1:13:01 --> 1:13:02
and the win.

1845
1:13:02 --> 1:13:05
I win today with 800 points.

1846
1:13:05 --> 1:13:06
Matt, you're in second place.

1847
1:13:06 --> 1:13:07
No worries, big guy.

1848
1:13:07 --> 1:13:09
You've got negative 2000 points

1849
1:13:10 --> 1:13:12
and Paul in there bringing up the rear

1850
1:13:12 --> 1:13:15
with negative 6800 points.

1851
1:13:15 --> 1:13:16
That's from Smitty Scoop.

1852
1:13:17 --> 1:13:17
Thank you, Smitty Scoop.

1853
1:13:18 --> 1:13:20
If you want to send us a Scooper to your price

1854
1:13:20 --> 1:13:21
to scratch Jack versus nerd

1855
1:13:21 --> 1:13:22
or an obelisk Jack versus nerd

1856
1:13:22 --> 1:13:24
or send us some Scoop mail.

1857
1:13:24 --> 1:13:25

1859
1:13:27 --> 1:13:28
Go over there, hastecoops.com.

1860
1:13:28 --> 1:13:30
Make us a Jack versus nerd.

1861
1:13:30 --> 1:13:31
We'll play it on the show.

1862
1:13:31 --> 1:13:32
It'll be great.

1863
1:13:33 --> 1:13:34
Yeah, you'll, you'll,

1864
1:13:34 --> 1:13:35
there's nothing more thrilling.

1865
1:13:37 --> 1:13:39
Well, maybe, maybe just all torso.

1866
1:13:40 --> 1:13:43
Um, I want to thank the show for a while.

1867
1:13:43 --> 1:13:45
All the people who support us at the show.

1868
1:13:45 --> 1:13:46
Can you take just the torso

1869
1:13:46 --> 1:13:47
to the job of my experience?

1870
1:13:50 --> 1:13:51
Well, you won't have to worry about the eyeballs.

1871
1:13:51 --> 1:13:52
Just buy a ticket.

1872
1:13:53 --> 1:13:53
That's all they want.

1873
1:13:54 --> 1:13:56
I can't believe they made him buy a ticket.

1874
1:13:56 --> 1:13:57
I love it.

1875
1:13:58 --> 1:13:59
Um, I want to thank all people

1876
1:13:59 --> 1:14:01
who support us and support the show.

1877
1:14:01 --> 1:14:02
I mean, this show has to keep going.

1878
1:14:05 --> 1:14:06
Clearly this is important.

1879
1:14:06 --> 1:14:08
Please, we're serving a need.

1880
1:14:08 --> 1:14:09
Lord's work here.

1881
1:14:11 --> 1:14:13

Or if you're really into the world of improv

1884
1:14:35 --> 1:14:38

1886
1:14:45 --> 1:14:51

1887

1888

It takes you over to our Patreon page

1889
1:14:54 --> 1:14:56
where for as little as $3 a month,

1890
1:14:56 --> 1:14:59
you can help us reach our dream

1891
1:14:59 --> 1:15:01
of getting one of those torsos.

1892
1:15:01 --> 1:15:02
So we can get a torso.

1893
1:15:03 --> 1:15:04
We will name it after you.

1894
1:15:04 --> 1:15:06
It'll be a whole thing right over there,

1895
1:15:06 --> 1:15:09
preachingfund.com, fartsandabag.biz.

1896
1:15:09 --> 1:15:10
A churn torso.

1897
1:15:10 --> 1:15:12
And Jake, you can have it on Mondays and Tuesdays.

1898
1:15:13 --> 1:15:16
Paul, can I have it on Wednesdays and Thursdays?

1899
1:15:17 --> 1:15:18
Not at all. Paul's not getting it.

1900
1:15:18 --> 1:15:20
Not after putting Crisco in the last one.

1901
1:15:21 --> 1:15:23
You couldn't tell where the Crisco started.

1902
1:15:26 --> 1:15:29
Uh, yeah. Thanks everybody for listening.

1903
1:15:29 --> 1:15:32
Stay safe out there. We love you and we'll see you soon.

1904
1:15:32 --> 1:15:33
We'll see you soon.

1905
1:15:37 --> 1:15:38
I was afraid doing a double today

1906
1:15:38 --> 1:15:40
with maybe a weird one for the second one.

1907
1:15:40 --> 1:15:42
No, no, it's always easy.

1908
1:15:43 --> 1:15:44
Always easy to come up with good stuff.

1909
1:15:49 --> 1:15:51
We're doubling up on Friday, too.

1910
1:15:52 --> 1:15:52
We are.

1911
1:15:53 --> 1:15:54
Fuck it. Hey, baby.

1912
1:15:54 --> 1:15:56
Dancing with the devil.

1913
1:15:56 --> 1:15:57
Ride the devil.

1914
1:16:02 --> 1:16:03
We're preachingfund.

1915
1:16:03 --> 1:16:09
Shit, we're a fucking ticket to carry a doll around with him.

1916
1:16:10 --> 1:16:10
So gross.

1917
1:16:11 --> 1:16:13
The more I think of it, the more I'm just like,

1918
1:16:13 --> 1:16:14
oh, the people at John Wick experience

1919
1:16:14 --> 1:16:16
were just being mean to that guy.

1920
1:16:16 --> 1:16:17
Also took her to the sphere.

1921
1:16:18 --> 1:16:20
So that was another, that's a really expensive ticket.

1922
1:16:20 --> 1:16:22
That's a fucking ticket there.

1923
1:16:23 --> 1:16:24
Hope you put her eyes back in.

1924
1:16:26 --> 1:16:28
Well, otherwise she wouldn't be able to enjoy it.

1925
1:16:28 --> 1:16:29
That's exactly right.

1926
1:16:30 --> 1:16:31
He might enjoy it, but not her.

1927
1:16:32 --> 1:16:33
Bye.
