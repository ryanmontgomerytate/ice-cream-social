## Transcript

**[0:00:03]** Oh, hello there, I am so happy you're here

**[0:00:06]** because I wanna thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

**[0:00:09]** Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

**[0:00:11]** It's a new month, we don't have a new list yet.

**[0:00:13]** Happy December, by the way,

**[0:00:15]** but we won't thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver

**[0:00:18]** at this part of a future show.

**[0:00:20]** I met the lost Ice Cream Truck Driver last night.

**[0:00:23]** She came to the show and introduced herself

**[0:00:25]** to me personally.

**[0:00:26]** I was so happy to meet an Ice Cream Truck Driver.

**[0:00:29]** If you wanna meet an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

**[0:00:31]** if you wanna be an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

**[0:00:32]** if you wanna meet one, it's easier.

**[0:00:34]** But if you wanna be one, preachyfun.com,

**[0:00:37]** preachyfun.com is where you can go to sign up

**[0:00:38]** to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows?

**[0:00:41]** The life you save may be your own.

**[0:00:48]** Ow, it's a show.

**[0:00:49]** Hey Johnny, you wanna go to an Ice Cream Social?

**[0:00:53]** Yeah, I'd love to.

**[0:00:54]** Great, let's go.

**[0:01:00]** Mike Jones is here, the jazz demon.

**[0:01:03]** I am.

**[0:01:14]** It's time for Matt Manley's Ice Cream Social,

**[0:01:16]** sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly.

**[0:01:19]** Sitting at sea, it's Matt Donnelly.

**[0:01:21]** In Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob, the audio guy.

**[0:01:23]** We're preaching fun.

**[0:01:24]** We're preaching fun.

**[0:01:26]** Greetings from the ocean.

**[0:01:28]** Yes.

**[0:01:29]** Ahoy.

**[0:01:30]** Ahoy indeed.

**[0:01:31]** Mike, do people still call you the jazz demon?

**[0:01:33]** And when did first people start calling you that?

**[0:01:36]** It was as a small child.

**[0:01:40]** It was on my second birthday.

**[0:01:43]** It was a rainy evening.

**[0:01:44]** It was after the second conviction for arson.

**[0:01:51]** No, of course that was, I believe that was,

**[0:01:54]** Zeke Zabrowski from the Penn and Teller show

**[0:01:57]** back when he was a young child.

**[0:01:59]** He started calling me the jazz demon very early on

**[0:02:02]** in my career with Penn and Teller,

**[0:02:05]** and Penn latched onto it

**[0:02:07]** and still uses it every night in the show.

**[0:02:11]** And I have a jazz demon license plate.

**[0:02:14]** So I can't get rid of it now.

**[0:02:15]** Oh, yeah, you're stuck with it now.

**[0:02:17]** Oh, it's more, it's more horrific than that

**[0:02:19]** because you can only use how many, whatever, seven letters.

**[0:02:24]** So I decided to use J-A-Z-Z-D-M-N

**[0:02:29]** because I thought J-Z-Z-D-M-O-N might be

**[0:02:34]** a different connotation, not on a B, G-S-D-N-O.

**[0:02:39]** So I went with jazz demon,

**[0:02:41]** but then I get these people to say,

**[0:02:43]** jazz demand, what does that mean?

**[0:02:47]** And so I just ignore people.

**[0:02:49]** Do people stop you and talk to you

**[0:02:51]** about your license plate all the time?

**[0:02:52]** I feel like this is something that happens in Las Vegas,

**[0:02:54]** is people discuss other people's license plates.

**[0:02:57]** Yeah, it's happened more than once,

**[0:02:59]** which is one time too many.

**[0:03:01]** No, it's fine.

**[0:03:04]** It bothers me when I come up behind people

**[0:03:06]** and I can't figure out what their plate's supposed to mean.

**[0:03:10]** It always means jizz on my penis, that's what it means.

**[0:03:13]** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[0:03:16]** But it's been, yeah, it's been 25 years.

**[0:03:19]** I don't use it myself, you know,

**[0:03:22]** hey, how you doing?

**[0:03:23]** I'm the jazz demon.

**[0:03:25]** Never introduced myself that way.

**[0:03:27]** However, I'm not offended when others refer to me as that,

**[0:03:34]** but yeah, it's been, but Zeke came up with that

**[0:03:39]** because you know, metal, right?

**[0:03:41]** I guess more metal is better.

**[0:03:46]** He keeps wanting me to start the piano on fire

**[0:03:49]** and play a lot of metal music, but I won't do it.

**[0:03:54]** Great balls of fire.

**[0:03:55]** No, no, he wants like, I don't know, mega death.

**[0:03:59]** He wants some mega death covers with the piano burning.

**[0:04:03]** I think that'd be a fun new addition

**[0:04:05]** to the pre-show at Penn & Teller.

**[0:04:07]** Don't give them any ideas.

**[0:04:09]** Have you ever played any kind of stunt piano

**[0:04:11]** for any kind of gig?

**[0:04:13]** I have not, luckily.

**[0:04:17]** I mean, in my youth, I would do my Jerry Lee Lewis

**[0:04:21]** impersonation and hit the piano with my feet

**[0:04:23]** and stuff like that.

**[0:04:26]** But no, I try to respect the instrument.

**[0:04:32]** You know, when I would play in like lounges

**[0:04:39]** and some asshole would set his drink on the piano

**[0:04:42]** right in front of me while I'm playing a song,

**[0:04:44]** I would scream, it's not furniture, asshole.

**[0:04:48]** You know?

**[0:04:48]** You want to set your drink on somebody's violin?

**[0:04:51]** Really smart, thanks.

**[0:04:53]** But, and that got me a lot of tips, you know?

**[0:04:55]** That's why I was so successful.

**[0:04:59]** Hey, could you play some Billy Joe?

**[0:05:00]** Why don't you fuck off?

**[0:05:01]** No.

**[0:05:05]** Our piano player here is great.

**[0:05:07]** He takes requests, but only the requests he wants to take.

**[0:05:10]** Exactly.

**[0:05:11]** Our musical director, Mike, at the Second City,

**[0:05:15]** he, you know, they had a piano that was there

**[0:05:17]** on the stage all the time.

**[0:05:19]** And this was when we were sharing the stage

**[0:05:22]** with the expert-less dancers.

**[0:05:24]** So they would come in and do the show late night

**[0:05:26]** after we were done.

**[0:05:27]** And there was one day we came in for rehearsal

**[0:05:30]** and there was an unmistakable coochie print

**[0:05:33]** right on the piano top that you just couldn't get away from.

**[0:05:38]** And we all just spent the day kind of oogling it.

**[0:05:40]** Mike just kind of had to play around it.

**[0:05:42]** Oogling it.

**[0:05:44]** You didn't clean it?

**[0:05:45]** No, we didn't clean it.

**[0:05:46]** You didn't go get some fucking furniture spray.

**[0:05:48]** Man, it's like Jesus' face in a piece of toast

**[0:05:50]** or something, you don't fucking have that shit.

**[0:05:53]** You guys just kept taking turns blindfolding each other,

**[0:05:56]** playing pin the clip on the pussy.

**[0:05:58]** And you just kind of just go around and see if you can.

**[0:06:01]** Yeah, so there's definitely lots of respect

**[0:06:03]** for the instrument out here in Las Vegas.

**[0:06:05]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:06:06]** I had a bit of a reputation

**[0:06:08]** because many, many years ago,

**[0:06:10]** this is way before the internet times,

**[0:06:13]** there was a cartoon in the New Yorker

**[0:06:15]** that showed a guy playing like cocktail piano.

**[0:06:18]** And it's in the caption underneath was,

**[0:06:21]** you people make me sick.

**[0:06:22]** Nevertheless, here's another toe tapper.

**[0:06:26]** There it is.

**[0:06:28]** That's great.

**[0:06:29]** A bunch of people, I got like seven copies of that

**[0:06:32]** in the mail to me.

**[0:06:34]** Sure.

**[0:06:34]** So I guess I had a reputation.

**[0:06:36]** Friends know you, I'm suffering a bad.

**[0:06:39]** Now at this point,

**[0:06:41]** you've been with the Penn and Teller show

**[0:06:42]** for quite a while.

**[0:06:44]** There have been many different iterations

**[0:06:46]** of the stage there.

**[0:06:48]** Have you ever considered talking them into

**[0:06:51]** maybe having a Batman like secret two key press

**[0:06:54]** that would then sink your piano into the stage

**[0:06:57]** or open up a secret window?

**[0:06:59]** Yeah.

**[0:07:00]** Teller has been talking for years

**[0:07:01]** about wanting to make the piano float somehow

**[0:07:05]** over the stage.

**[0:07:07]** I think hopefully they've gotten that out of there

**[0:07:10]** that's passed them by.

**[0:07:13]** But I think they were,

**[0:07:15]** I'm hoping they'll age out of that idea.

**[0:07:18]** It's, I've been with them almost half their career now.

**[0:07:21]** 25 years almost.

**[0:07:23]** And it's great about,

**[0:07:29]** I don't know, well, I'm bad with time now,

**[0:07:30]** but several years ago,

**[0:07:33]** they surprised me with a Mike Jones corner

**[0:07:36]** on the right side of the stage

**[0:07:37]** with the neon sign and the Mike Jones duo.

**[0:07:41]** And, but yeah, I'm happy with the piano staying.

**[0:07:45]** And also just from a practical standpoint,

**[0:07:47]** you can't.

**[0:07:49]** Whoa.

**[0:07:52]** That is very practical.

**[0:07:53]** Those are, that's our sound effect

**[0:07:55]** for telling you to get the fuck out of here, Mike.

**[0:07:58]** Take your directions and go.

**[0:07:59]** Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[0:08:03]** Technical issues on our side.

**[0:08:05]** So yeah, you had the surprise of the reveal

**[0:08:07]** of the corner there dedicated to you.

**[0:08:11]** Yeah, that was nice.

**[0:08:12]** But I don't think you really should move a piano often

**[0:08:16]** because it's...

**[0:08:18]** I try not to.

**[0:08:19]** Yeah, well, they're heavy and also they go out of tune.

**[0:08:23]** I didn't think about that.

**[0:08:23]** But I think the teller's idea may be more in line

**[0:08:28]** with having a car appear on stage, you know what I mean?

**[0:08:34]** So I leave that up to them.

**[0:08:38]** But I'll play wherever they put me.

**[0:08:40]** When I, I've been doing these 50th anniversary gigs

**[0:08:43]** with them and it's been really fun.

**[0:08:46]** And we were doing Boston a couple of weeks ago

**[0:08:48]** and Glenn said, what if we put you up in one of the boxes?

**[0:08:51]** And I said, well, I'd sort of prefer to be on the stage.

**[0:08:56]** I felt like, okay.

**[0:08:58]** And so they made it work, but it was great.

**[0:09:00]** But, you know, there are, there are shows,

**[0:09:02]** as you guys know, many, many shows now,

**[0:09:05]** the orchestra is not in the same theater as the performance.

**[0:09:10]** They're in a, you know, they're in a basement

**[0:09:11]** somewhere and I, you know, and it's,

**[0:09:14]** I sort of draw the line there, you know?

**[0:09:19]** If I'm appearing with Ben and Tyler,

**[0:09:20]** I'd like to be in the same building.

**[0:09:23]** I'm often disappointed when I find that the orchestra

**[0:09:25]** is in a different space, like in a room next door.

**[0:09:28]** Yeah, it's, the first time I came across that

**[0:09:30]** was many years ago, there was a puppet show,

**[0:09:33]** Avenue Q, I think it was, at the Wynn.

**[0:09:37]** And I went to it and they're like,

**[0:09:39]** and look out up on the TV, there's our guys

**[0:09:41]** in a suite four, you know, four floors away.

**[0:09:43]** And I was like, oh, that's kind of a rip-off.

**[0:09:46]** And I was crazy too, because in that room

**[0:09:47]** we had an orchestra pit, we just didn't use it

**[0:09:50]** for Avenue Q.

**[0:09:53]** Too good for them.

**[0:09:54]** That's right.

**[0:09:55]** That's right.

**[0:09:55]** That's weird.

**[0:09:57]** For Spamalot, right after Avenue Q,

**[0:09:58]** we had like 28 orchestra members

**[0:10:01]** down in the, in the orchestra pit right there.

**[0:10:03]** I don't know why it didn't get used for Avenue Q.

**[0:10:06]** Yeah, they, they name it an orchestra pit

**[0:10:08]** because there's an orchestra in it, you know?

**[0:10:12]** But I don't want to put you in a suite

**[0:10:13]** and keep you away from people.

**[0:10:15]** You don't want to be in allusions with pianos.

**[0:10:18]** What allusions do you want to be a part of, Mike?

**[0:10:21]** All of them.

**[0:10:24]** I'll do anything.

**[0:10:25]** Can we get you in Georgie's Queen of Hearts dress

**[0:10:28]** for the, for that one bit?

**[0:10:30]** Can we get you in the picture?

**[0:10:30]** Yeah, yeah, I, you know, I, I, it's funny.

**[0:10:33]** Someone just asked me last night at the show,

**[0:10:36]** are you part of any of the tricks?

**[0:10:39]** And I don't think that there's,

**[0:10:41]** there's never been a trick that I've been a part of

**[0:10:45]** except for doing all the music.

**[0:10:47]** And I mean, and also the girl, the gorilla

**[0:10:50]** where I did the narration, which was actually fun,

**[0:10:52]** which I had like a whole thing alive, alive, alive.

**[0:10:55]** You know, and on the inside,

**[0:10:57]** Zomofo, the gorilla girl.

**[0:10:59]** And I did a whole carnival barking thing

**[0:11:00]** while I played like silent movie music.

**[0:11:03]** But mostly, I mean, and air sacs.

**[0:11:06]** I mean, we were, I was in center stage for that

**[0:11:08]** with Brian.

**[0:11:09]** But yeah, but I mean, they're not asking me to, you know,

**[0:11:13]** do any tricky shuffling or, hey, let's, you know,

**[0:11:18]** come on up for this trick.

**[0:11:19]** And let's let our piano player shuffle these cards.

**[0:11:23]** I think you would have made a really great ball pitch roll.

**[0:11:27]** Oh yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

**[0:11:30]** I remember that, that was a bit that was done.

**[0:11:32]** Oh, what?

**[0:11:33]** Twice?

**[0:11:35]** Twice, yeah.

**[0:11:36]** Well, it was not, it was, it was a teed up.

**[0:11:39]** If you see it on the Fula show, it's my son.

**[0:11:42]** Oh, I know, I was there.

**[0:11:44]** I was playing the ball control music.

**[0:11:46]** I'm also talking to the audience listening to our podcast.

**[0:11:49]** Oh, oh, oh, you have listeners?

**[0:11:56]** At minimum, the ones that are here now.

**[0:11:59]** I'm working on that.

**[0:12:02]** And we found it on the internet at the end of the day.

**[0:12:06]** And they're like, do they still do that bit?

**[0:12:07]** I was like, they never did that bit.

**[0:12:11]** This was it.

**[0:12:13]** I was like, you are the only ball pitch roll, buddy.

**[0:12:16]** Yeah, I think that there's only, I don't,

**[0:12:19]** there's not many tricks, not many bits

**[0:12:21]** that they've only done that limited amount of times,

**[0:12:24]** except for stuff that they did,

**[0:12:25]** especially for television.

**[0:12:27]** I think specifically it was done the year before COVID.

**[0:12:31]** So their ambition for it was to do it in the summertime

**[0:12:35]** where they got more families visiting.

**[0:12:37]** Yeah, I remember.

**[0:12:38]** They were actually going to recruit a kid each show

**[0:12:40]** before it happened.

**[0:12:41]** And then COVID happened,

**[0:12:42]** and then three seasons of Fula's happened.

**[0:12:44]** So by the time the show came back,

**[0:12:45]** they weren't like, let's dust off that old chestnut.

**[0:12:47]** Yeah, that's in one of our videos.

**[0:12:49]** I was like, I'm back in there.

**[0:12:49]** You know, and the crew loves it.

**[0:12:54]** Yeah.

**[0:12:54]** Cleaning up all those balls and setting up the perimeter

**[0:12:58]** and getting a kid to do magic.

**[0:13:01]** Yeah.

**[0:13:03]** I want to ask about it.

**[0:13:04]** He's like, oh, I would love to have done it again.

**[0:13:07]** And he is now like two feet taller than he was when he did it.

**[0:13:10]** Right.

**[0:13:11]** You can't do it again, everybody.

**[0:13:13]** Get in the thing. Yeah.

**[0:13:14]** You're out. You are out.

**[0:13:16]** It's over. Yeah, it's over.

**[0:13:18]** That part of your life is done.

**[0:13:20]** Well, I, yeah, I walked by a couple of months ago.

**[0:13:24]** I walked by Robbie Living,

**[0:13:25]** like after the end of Haystack,

**[0:13:28]** and he's like, you know, sweeping the hay up.

**[0:13:31]** And I said, the glamour of showbiz, you know,

**[0:13:35]** like he's, you know, picking up piles of hay

**[0:13:37]** and pulling cards out of it, you know.

**[0:13:41]** But there's a lot of...

**[0:13:43]** Tell us the story to Jessica Jane and I.

**[0:13:48]** He was talking about they were working on Broadway

**[0:13:50]** and he had like a boil on like the inside of his thigh or whatever.

**[0:13:53]** And it was, his costume was irritating him,

**[0:13:56]** especially after they did water tank or something.

**[0:13:59]** So he's doing a change.

**[0:14:00]** They said they had this flamboyant customer on Broadway

**[0:14:04]** who basically had to help tell her pop the boil.

**[0:14:07]** Oh, boy.

**[0:14:09]** Yeah.

**[0:14:10]** And he said he just looked at the teller.

**[0:14:11]** Dressers and wardrobe people on Broadway go above and beyond.

**[0:14:15]** Above and beyond, right?

**[0:14:17]** And he said he just looked at the teller from down on his knees

**[0:14:20]** going, ah, showbiz, the tinsel in the glamour.

**[0:14:27]** That's disgusting.

**[0:14:28]** Oh, yeah, the glamour made me laugh so hard.

**[0:14:37]** Jonesy, you are a podcaster now.

**[0:14:39]** I am a podcaster in conjunction with the great Jennifer Zabel.

**[0:14:44]** She's actually running everything.

**[0:14:48]** Yeah, yeah, she's she makes it happen.

**[0:14:52]** But I it's, you know, it's you've been on it.

**[0:14:56]** It's now actually a thing.

**[0:14:59]** It's I just started talking to people

**[0:15:01]** that I knew about music and what they liked and music in their lives.

**[0:15:05]** And, you know, I had these.

**[0:15:06]** I had the idea came through working with David Silverman from The Simpsons

**[0:15:11]** because obviously he's not known as a musician.

**[0:15:15]** He's known as a great animator and and he but he he's a serious

**[0:15:20]** tuba guy and he plays the tuba.

**[0:15:23]** And so I said, you know, and then Bill Prady,

**[0:15:27]** who does the Big Bang Theory, who wrote that show

**[0:15:30]** and many, many others, he started playing the saxophone

**[0:15:34]** like when he was 60. Wow.

**[0:15:36]** And I said, you know, I know all these people.

**[0:15:39]** Yeah, I know all these people that that that music is important to them,

**[0:15:44]** even though they're not known for music.

**[0:15:46]** And so that's sort of opened the door.

**[0:15:49]** And then I started talking with more musicians

**[0:15:52]** and also a lot of critics and people that are around music.

**[0:15:58]** And I just did I'm very excited.

**[0:16:00]** I just did a great conversation with Eric, Eric Mingus,

**[0:16:03]** who's Charles Mingus's son.

**[0:16:05]** And you know, you don't get much higher up in the jazz royals

**[0:16:10]** even Mingus and your stories of him growing up

**[0:16:14]** and being there when Mingus met Joni Mitchell.

**[0:16:17]** And, you know, it's it's really cool.

**[0:16:19]** I mean, I'm enjoying it.

**[0:16:21]** I mean, maybe maybe my audience is 10 people.

**[0:16:24]** But I'm loving it, you know, you should have Jacob

**[0:16:28]** want to talk about kiss because he loves kiss.

**[0:16:30]** Yeah, yeah, I know.

**[0:16:32]** I mean, that's I'm not, you know, I've I've had I had Scotty Meltzer on.

**[0:16:37]** He was a juggler and and I just said,

**[0:16:41]** you've got the worst taste in music of anyone I've ever met.

**[0:16:43]** Tell us about it.

**[0:16:45]** And he did, you know, and it was great.

**[0:16:50]** But this is worth some good dose.

**[0:16:52]** Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

**[0:16:54]** Oh, that's impossible.

**[0:16:56]** That can't be true.

**[0:16:57]** No, it's true.

**[0:16:58]** I mean, the only difference between Scotty and Godot is

**[0:17:02]** and I will give Scotty the edge on this.

**[0:17:04]** I believe Scotty can also appreciate good music

**[0:17:09]** better than Godot.

**[0:17:10]** You know what I mean?

**[0:17:12]** I I think I think Godot has just got, you know,

**[0:17:15]** really pedestrian music and and, you know.

**[0:17:19]** And you're right.

**[0:17:20]** He just doesn't care.

**[0:17:21]** Yeah. But Scotty, he actively seeks out

**[0:17:24]** every horrific show tune you've ever heard.

**[0:17:27]** And and, you know, he was he was in

**[0:17:31]** he was like a musical kid.

**[0:17:33]** He was in like, you know, musicals as a child and stuff.

**[0:17:37]** And it's just so deeply disturbing.

**[0:17:41]** I was in a lot of musicals as a child.

**[0:17:44]** I don't listen only to show tunes, though.

**[0:17:46]** I listen to other music.

**[0:17:49]** He can appreciate Miles Davis, too.

**[0:17:51]** But I don't think Godot cares

**[0:17:52]** whether it's Miles Davis or or Bette Midler.

**[0:17:55]** You know what I mean?

**[0:17:56]** Um, but so I give Scotty the advantage there.

**[0:18:00]** But but but my point is that everybody's got really not everybody.

**[0:18:04]** But most people have the people I want to talk to

**[0:18:07]** have really interesting stories about growing up with it

**[0:18:10]** and what they listen to as kids and how they got into music.

**[0:18:12]** And sort of when they realized that music,

**[0:18:15]** they were listening to music different than all their classmates.

**[0:18:18]** You know what I mean?

**[0:18:19]** The music became more important to them,

**[0:18:21]** usually at an earlier age than than every than most people.

**[0:18:26]** Because I as I used to have to tell my father,

**[0:18:28]** who always promoted me, oh, my son's a great jazz piano player.

**[0:18:32]** I'd say nobody cares about jazz, dad.

**[0:18:34]** And even less people care about solo piano in jazz.

**[0:18:39]** So, you know, I'm looking for the people that care about that stuff

**[0:18:43]** that are also creative in other ways, writers, you know, and everybody.

**[0:18:47]** I mean, just, you know, if you've got interesting stories

**[0:18:49]** to talk about, kiss, I want to hear them, you know?

**[0:18:59]** I mean, you know, Matt and I talked about some guy from Jersey, some singer,

**[0:19:04]** singer, songwriter, Southside Johnny.

**[0:19:09]** Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.

**[0:19:11]** We did an hour. We did an hour on Southside Johnny.

**[0:19:16]** But but that's been a lot of fun.

**[0:19:18]** It's really it's it's the stereo image.

**[0:19:20]** It's called the stereo image.

**[0:19:22]** Stereo image.

**[0:19:23]** And we got a great logo

**[0:19:28]** done by Matt Rockman, who's doing all the stuff for Penn and Teller these days.

**[0:19:32]** And he came up with this really cool, like it's like 3D glasses

**[0:19:36]** with the VU meters on it.

**[0:19:39]** And it's really because it's sort of retro and it's sort of, you know,

**[0:19:42]** it's got a little bit of everything.

**[0:19:44]** And the stereo image is on all platforms or the stereo image dot com.

**[0:19:50]** And I'm going to do I'm doing Oscar Peterson's daughter next week.

**[0:19:56]** She's got great stories.

**[0:19:58]** Yeah, I mean, we're really getting I've got I if I were smart,

**[0:20:02]** I would have the list of people we've done in front of me, but I don't.

**[0:20:06]** But no one's that smart.

**[0:20:08]** No, it's OK. Well, I'm, you know, it's but it's Piff and Jade on.

**[0:20:12]** It's I had Piff and Jade on and it was hysterical because we did it from

**[0:20:15]** the Piff we did our first remote podcast from Piff's lair.

**[0:20:21]** Oh, nice cave. Yeah.

**[0:20:23]** And it was it was it was a control freak like Piff,

**[0:20:27]** making sure that you did it in his studio, not yours.

**[0:20:30]** Well, Piff. So I like him.

**[0:20:33]** Piff has. Horrific taste.

**[0:20:39]** That's what I was curious about. Yeah, I know he likes him.

**[0:20:43]** He likes don't know what music he likes.

**[0:20:45]** He likes suicidal coffee shop, plaintive, plaintive whaling,

**[0:20:52]** singer, songwriter, 18 year old.

**[0:20:55]** My boyfriend left me and I kill myself.

**[0:20:57]** Music he lives the most practicing.

**[0:21:01]** It's it's I mean, and he loves it and he just listens to it,

**[0:21:05]** I guess according to Jade all the time.

**[0:21:08]** But yeah, we we did it.

**[0:21:11]** Yeah, well, we did Dara Godfried.

**[0:21:13]** We did, you know, I talked about Gilbert's song.

**[0:21:16]** And I mean, we did a lot.

**[0:21:18]** I mean, we've got about maybe like 30, 30 done so far.

**[0:21:21]** But but I'm looking at Gilbert's taste of music.

**[0:21:25]** Gilbert, I don't I don't know if we did.

**[0:21:28]** I we did have her very early on.

**[0:21:30]** Um, I don't know.

**[0:21:32]** We talked about Gilbert's podcast, of course, which was great.

**[0:21:35]** Yes, he didn't really we didn't really talk about his music taste.

**[0:21:39]** I don't I don't know if Gilbert knew music existed.

**[0:21:43]** Yeah, I'm very curious about that.

**[0:21:44]** I'll tell you one thing.

**[0:21:45]** I'll tell you a Gilbert story.

**[0:21:47]** I I was at so Gilbert was over at my house.

**[0:21:51]** This is 20 years ago, 15 years ago, and we're just hanging out.

**[0:21:59]** And I told our friend, Michael Lynn, we had a mutual friend,

**[0:22:02]** Mickey Lynn, whose whose father had passed away.

**[0:22:06]** And he asked me, Mickey, his father loved Mark's brothers.

**[0:22:10]** And he asked me if I would play a version of hello, I must be going

**[0:22:17]** for him to play at the funeral and recorded for him.

**[0:22:21]** So I did, you know, and I was telling Gilbert that story,

**[0:22:24]** who knew who knew Mickey as well.

**[0:22:25]** And all of a sudden, Gilbert launches into a perfect rendition

**[0:22:31]** of of old groucho singing, hello, I must be going.

**[0:22:36]** And I totally spaced that Gilbert did perfect groucho.

**[0:22:41]** It was like young groucho.

**[0:22:43]** You bet your life groucho and old groucho.

**[0:22:45]** And he's just walking around my kitchen like, hello, I must be going.

**[0:22:49]** You know, and I just lost it.

**[0:22:51]** I was like, oh, fuck, you know, I forgot you're a genius.

**[0:22:56]** But he's my favorite impersonation.

**[0:22:58]** One of my favorites was his impersonation of Penn.

**[0:23:02]** Because we're at lunch one day and he's and he's sitting there.

**[0:23:06]** And all of a sudden, Gilbert's just looking at the table.

**[0:23:09]** We're waiting for the waiters to come over and there's these salt shakers,

**[0:23:12]** salt and pepper shakers.

**[0:23:12]** And he goes, oh, salt, salt, oh, let's look at the salt today this week.

**[0:23:18]** And then he goes into Penn and he goes this week on bullshit.

**[0:23:20]** We've got the National Salt Association because salt is pro salt.

**[0:23:25]** And then we've got the Anti-Salt Association.

**[0:23:26]** Salt is bullshit.

**[0:23:31]** He did five minutes of Penn talking about salt and it was just genius.

**[0:23:39]** But yeah, he I'm missing that he was great.

**[0:23:44]** But anyhow, but we got off.

**[0:23:48]** But yeah, the podcast is great and everyone should listen and subscribe

**[0:23:52]** and make me famous and then also because, you know,

**[0:23:57]** how long can I play this piano?

**[0:23:58]** I really belong in podcasting.

**[0:24:03]** Um, the non stop world of podcasting.

**[0:24:07]** That's right.

**[0:24:08]** Uh, do you really see like a world where you use your, your, your,

**[0:24:13]** you don't play piano?

**[0:24:15]** Yeah, that world is when I'm dead.

**[0:24:17]** That's what I thought.

**[0:24:18]** Yeah, I often want to be, I want to be like the 93 year old guy

**[0:24:23]** that they wheel out in a wheelchair chair and say, you know,

**[0:24:26]** jazz legend Mike Jones and I, and I eat a little pudding

**[0:24:29]** and I play a couple of songs and he's like, isn't it amazing?

**[0:24:32]** He could still play at this age.

**[0:24:33]** Okay, get him off the stage.

**[0:24:35]** You know, that's, that's what I see my, my golden years.

**[0:24:38]** I just saw a video, a TikTok with an elderly woman

**[0:24:42]** who's suffering from dementia.

**[0:24:44]** She's I believe 93.

**[0:24:46]** And maybe you saw this, Jonesy, but she's a classically trained

**[0:24:50]** pianist, but she doesn't remember that she's a classically

**[0:24:54]** trained pianist anymore.

**[0:24:55]** However, they consider in front of a piano and say,

**[0:24:58]** could you play such and such?

**[0:24:59]** And she's like, well, I don't know it, but then she'll do it.

**[0:25:02]** You know, right?

**[0:25:02]** I have seen it.

**[0:25:03]** Yeah, it's remarkable at the way there it is, the way music

**[0:25:07]** acts in the brain is something special.

**[0:25:11]** Oh, it is.

**[0:25:11]** Jonesy, would that be better or worse than current life?

**[0:25:14]** Would it be better or worse?

**[0:25:16]** I think you could still play anything, any piece of music

**[0:25:19]** that you could play now, you can play it, but you don't

**[0:25:22]** remember any of the music.

**[0:25:23]** So you don't have to think about any of the music.

**[0:25:25]** I love life.

**[0:25:26]** This is a dream.

**[0:25:30]** I I just want to I just want to sit somewhere and have them

**[0:25:33]** give me pudding.

**[0:25:34]** And that's that's really all I want.

**[0:25:36]** I don't really care about pudding.

**[0:25:39]** But but I'm we're used to you were saying something, Matt.

**[0:25:43]** Yeah, well, two different ways.

**[0:25:45]** One, I think you're the kind of kid that you didn't have to

**[0:25:47]** be like encouraged, like your parents

**[0:25:49]** enough like overly encouraged you to take piano.

**[0:25:50]** If anything, they took piano away from you as a punishment.

**[0:25:52]** Right? Yeah.

**[0:25:53]** Yeah, I was when I was like two and a half.

**[0:25:56]** My brother, who's five years older, was taking lessons.

**[0:25:58]** And I guess I would crawl up on the piano bench and play what

**[0:26:01]** he had been practicing.

**[0:26:03]** And so my parents unfortunately thought, well, we can make

**[0:26:07]** money off this kid.

**[0:26:08]** We'll send him to less, you know.

**[0:26:11]** And no, they just they just they always encouraged me.

**[0:26:14]** I had two player pianos in my house.

**[0:26:16]** So it was always around and it's all I wanted to do.

**[0:26:20]** And when I was in the third grade, my piano teacher said,

**[0:26:23]** you know, I don't ever get up before 10 or 11 in the

**[0:26:25]** morning. And that was a job for me.

**[0:26:28]** You were like, I can do that.

**[0:26:30]** Yeah, I hated getting up in the morning.

**[0:26:33]** Now, wait a minute.

**[0:26:33]** You said you had to play your pianos.

**[0:26:36]** Yeah, you know, the you know, the like with the scrolls,

**[0:26:38]** with the scroll and paper running through it and everything.

**[0:26:40]** Now they're now they're all, you know, now they're like

**[0:26:42]** Yamaha, Disclavier, and they don't know it's all it's all.

**[0:26:45]** But yes, in the olden days, it was a paper roll and it

**[0:26:48]** would go over a vacuum system that would cause the keys

**[0:26:50]** to go up and down.

**[0:26:51]** And we had an upright piano in my basement.

**[0:26:54]** And then in my living room, when I was about probably

**[0:26:57]** six or seven, my dad bought what was called a reproducing

**[0:27:01]** grand, which would 1926 when it was made, was the state

**[0:27:05]** of the art for rich people.

**[0:27:07]** It these may they made these roles.

**[0:27:09]** They were called expression pianos and they got louder

**[0:27:14]** and softer and sustained.

**[0:27:16]** So it didn't sound mechanical like a player piano.

**[0:27:19]** Oh, right.

**[0:27:20]** Like so I grew up with George Gershwin playing

**[0:27:22]** Rhapsody in Blue as if he was sitting at the piano

**[0:27:25]** in my house playing it.

**[0:27:27]** And they made a, you know, there was a company called

**[0:27:30]** Dewart and Ampico and Welty Mignon.

**[0:27:34]** And they were all these, they made these for the super rich.

**[0:27:38]** You know, I mean, when you're watching or when you're

**[0:27:40]** seeing that happen on that that piano machine,

**[0:27:44]** are you beyond just hearing the intonations and the ups

**[0:27:48]** and downs and the very, you know, the very nuanced

**[0:27:50]** playing of these masters?

**[0:27:52]** Are you also able to pick up on the mechanics of it?

**[0:27:55]** Does it does it come through and like the pedal step moves

**[0:27:58]** and all that kind of thing too?

**[0:27:59]** The pedal doesn't move, but the keys obviously go up and down.

**[0:28:03]** But were you able to study that was was that it was great?

**[0:28:06]** Yeah, because like if I put a Fats Waller piano roll on

**[0:28:08]** and I wanted to see what he was doing with his left hand,

**[0:28:12]** although it was many, many years, maybe like till I was

**[0:28:16]** 11 or 12, when it dawned on me, wait a minute,

**[0:28:20]** sometimes there's 11 keys going down.

**[0:28:23]** Maybe there's more than one person playing here.

**[0:28:25]** Then I found out it was well, they would double track them.

**[0:28:28]** Oh, wow. They would, you know, they would wait.

**[0:28:32]** And I've made piano rolls.

**[0:28:33]** I got to go to Q.R.S.

**[0:28:35]** And make piano wasn't the same piano that Duke Ellington

**[0:28:39]** and and and Ella Fitzgerald and Rachmaninoff and everybody played.

**[0:28:43]** Is there like a whole bunch connected to the to the piano key as well?

**[0:28:46]** No, it was more crazy than that.

**[0:28:49]** It's ink things.

**[0:28:51]** So the sheet of paper goes through, you press the keys down,

**[0:28:54]** it puts ink on the paper and then somebody stands,

**[0:28:59]** somebody sits there and cuts out a master roll by hand.

**[0:29:02]** Not at all.

**[0:29:04]** And then they then they make the master roll

**[0:29:07]** and then they produce them from that.

**[0:29:09]** So it's it's amazing.

**[0:29:11]** And I mean, at a time they had like 40 people in a room

**[0:29:16]** cutting out master rolls every day because it was so popular in the 20s and 30s.

**[0:29:21]** You know, and it's incredible.

**[0:29:23]** Yeah, it was really, really, really, you know, like old timey technology.

**[0:29:29]** And but the piano was so cool because it was an old, I think it was a Steinway.

**[0:29:34]** But it had been played so much that the ivory keys were all like

**[0:29:39]** scalloped in. Yeah. So that, you know, it was like soft, you know,

**[0:29:43]** there was there was like that much, wow, taken down on the keys

**[0:29:46]** just from the millions of people that played it out for 100 years.

**[0:29:50]** Yeah. And and like the little lip on the edge of the key is just completely gone.

**[0:29:54]** Like that little lip is worn away.

**[0:29:56]** Yeah, it's worn away from ivory.

**[0:29:58]** And and I think it's in the Smithsonian now.

**[0:30:01]** But but it's it was really cool in the 80s.

**[0:30:04]** The guy actually turns out that because they let black people play the piano,

**[0:30:09]** it had to be taken out.

**[0:30:10]** They took it to display down.

**[0:30:12]** Ah, yeah, that's a good job, man.

**[0:30:14]** It happens. It happens. Ouch.

**[0:30:17]** But anyways, so that's yeah, I've been, you know, so no, I was I I want to play,

**[0:30:23]** you know, I mean, as they say, I'll play till I drop dead, you know,

**[0:30:27]** if I can't like arthritis or I'd rather not have that.

**[0:30:33]** No, I actually, I mean, certainly I have I'm always on the edge.

**[0:30:38]** Um, I I

**[0:30:42]** I have I can I have like some tendinitis and some carpal tunnel,

**[0:30:47]** but not not to where it's affecting me.

**[0:30:50]** And I think the reason it doesn't is because I play so much.

**[0:30:53]** Um, but you don't relax long enough for it to set in.

**[0:30:58]** Well, what happens is, um, yeah, um,

**[0:31:02]** I take tumor turmeric and glucose amine and chondroitin

**[0:31:05]** and, you know, to stave off stuff like that.

**[0:31:07]** But what what what one of the great things about playing with the show

**[0:31:11]** on their fiftieth about five in the last five years,

**[0:31:14]** they develop this new technology for I couldn't play a keyboard ever.

**[0:31:18]** That was why it was always we can't take you on the road

**[0:31:22]** because we you can't play a keyboard because when you play a keyboard

**[0:31:25]** real quickly on pianists will notice.

**[0:31:29]** There's a there's a thing I think it's called the escapement

**[0:31:32]** at the bottom of when you press a piano down,

**[0:31:35]** if you press a piano key down very slowly,

**[0:31:37]** there'll be this little hitch at the very bottom and then it goes to the bottom.

**[0:31:41]** And that absorbs all the shock

**[0:31:45]** of the piano key hitting the bottom of the key bed.

**[0:31:49]** And even though they developed weighted keys for keyboards,

**[0:31:53]** there was never that kind of cushion.

**[0:31:56]** So your arm absorbed the entire shock of the of the key hitting

**[0:32:00]** and it would set me off in 20 minutes.

**[0:32:02]** And I never realized that.

**[0:32:05]** That's crazy. Yeah.

**[0:32:06]** And just in the last five years,

**[0:32:08]** Yamaha and Kawhi developed this new technology

**[0:32:12]** in their keyboards that has that feel.

**[0:32:16]** And I can play them all day and it doesn't bother me at all.

**[0:32:20]** And and it's actually better for the show

**[0:32:23]** because they don't have to mic the piano when I get there

**[0:32:27]** or anything like that.

**[0:32:28]** They just I mean, it's not the same as an acoustic

**[0:32:31]** seven foot piano, but it's really close enough for for for them.

**[0:32:35]** And and I like playing it.

**[0:32:37]** So so Kawhi is, you know, I'm a Kawhi artist

**[0:32:40]** and they just have one there for me.

**[0:32:42]** It's really great.

**[0:32:43]** Did you hear how he said it was good enough for them?

**[0:32:46]** It's good enough.

**[0:32:47]** Well, no, I mean, yeah, it's good enough for a magic show.

**[0:32:51]** All right.

**[0:32:52]** For the people setting up this fucking keyboard

**[0:32:55]** that don't want to go to the trouble of setting up a piano

**[0:32:57]** like a person. That's right.

**[0:33:00]** It's good enough for it.

**[0:33:02]** Also, it also means that the floating

**[0:33:05]** piano allusions back on the table.

**[0:33:07]** Yeah. Oh, yeah.

**[0:33:08]** Absolutely. Yeah.

**[0:33:10]** Have you got a piano?

**[0:33:12]** We don't knock it out of tune.

**[0:33:14]** You don't want to, you don't want to move that piano around.

**[0:33:16]** I'm happy to be in the floating piano allusion.

**[0:33:20]** I'm very happy to be in it.

**[0:33:22]** I just don't want to be responsible for it.

**[0:33:26]** I don't want to have to tune the piano after it's done.

**[0:33:29]** Yeah, yeah, it's like I had this stupid idea

**[0:33:33]** for Andy Cheek in the chat.

**[0:33:36]** Kiss fans won't hear the difference.

**[0:33:38]** Fuck you, Andy Cheek.

**[0:33:40]** Tough talk. Wow.

**[0:33:42]** You know, some coming from the blood.

**[0:33:46]** Some of the 100 members of Kiss of the past two centuries

**[0:33:49]** actually know more than two cores.

**[0:33:51]** That's true.

**[0:33:52]** Well, no, Ace Fraley died.

**[0:33:54]** So it's not anymore.

**[0:33:56]** Yeah. Yeah.

**[0:33:58]** But it's anyhow.

**[0:34:01]** Yeah, the piano with the piano

**[0:34:03]** situation has gotten really good finally.

**[0:34:06]** But so my hands don't hurt.

**[0:34:07]** You know, I'm really lucky.

**[0:34:09]** I mean, I I've been playing for I've been playing the piano

**[0:34:13]** for almost 60 years.

**[0:34:15]** But you know, and and a lot of old

**[0:34:21]** piano players that I've known over the years, you know,

**[0:34:23]** have not had problems with arthritis.

**[0:34:25]** But then again, like Oscar had it really bad,

**[0:34:28]** Oscar Peterson, and they just play through it, you know.

**[0:34:32]** But I've been lucky.

**[0:34:34]** I mean, I still have most of my faculties, not mental at all.

**[0:34:37]** I'm but overrated.

**[0:34:40]** But in anyways, and so if this is going out,

**[0:34:44]** but I will self promotion to jump off.

**[0:34:47]** If this is if anyone's hearing this on Monday in Vegas

**[0:34:50]** and have nothing to do tonight, meaning Monday,

**[0:34:53]** go down to Vicks at 7 p.m.

**[0:34:55]** Because I'm recording two different live albums in one night.

**[0:34:58]** Oh, nice.

**[0:35:00]** Or so 9 p.m.

**[0:35:01]** Two for the second set.

**[0:35:02]** Vicks downtown by the Smith Center.

**[0:35:06]** Yes. Oh, I would have put this here.

**[0:35:08]** I thought I thought this episode was coming out too late.

**[0:35:10]** It's coming out.

**[0:35:11]** Oh, no, it's no, it's it's Monday night.

**[0:35:13]** OK, tonight.

**[0:35:15]** Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,

**[0:35:17]** and it's it's the first set's going to be me and great.

**[0:35:21]** Yes, yeah.

**[0:35:23]** Every time I say Graham's name, Matt coughs.

**[0:35:25]** Yeah, you can't help it.

**[0:35:26]** He's allergic to Graham Dexter.

**[0:35:28]** Um, I'm doing it with Graham Dexter,

**[0:35:31]** who's an amazing guitar player and Alex Frank,

**[0:35:34]** who's an amazing bass player who found Penn's bass for him,

**[0:35:37]** who's a great he runs.

**[0:35:39]** He plays the bass in Jeff Goldblum's band,

**[0:35:42]** which is all hot L.A.

**[0:35:44]** studio players and Jeff Goldblum, but.

**[0:35:49]** It's but it's it's really it's it's we're doing like in the 1940s and 50s,

**[0:35:55]** right after World War Two,

**[0:35:57]** the most popular jazz combo setup was piano, bass and guitar.

**[0:36:03]** And so Nat King Cole's trio was piano, bass, guitar.

**[0:36:07]** Oscar Peterson had a trio.

**[0:36:09]** Art Tatum had a trio.

**[0:36:10]** That was like the thing.

**[0:36:11]** And then sort of in the 50s,

**[0:36:13]** drums work their way in, you know,

**[0:36:15]** because they felt sorry for drummers couldn't get a gig.

**[0:36:18]** So they gave them gigs and that that format sort of went away.

**[0:36:24]** And nobody does it really anymore.

**[0:36:26]** And I got together with these guys sort of as a tribute to that kind of music.

**[0:36:31]** And we did a record in my living room a few years ago.

**[0:36:34]** And the record label said you guys should do a real live album

**[0:36:38]** because it's really good.

**[0:36:39]** And there there's so much fun to play with that I'm really looking forward to it.

**[0:36:43]** And then because of a lot of behind the scenes stuff,

**[0:36:50]** the gram at the last minute wasn't sure he could do it.

**[0:36:52]** So I hired a drummer and then when Graham said he could do it,

**[0:36:57]** I said to the label, hey, why don't we just do two albums?

**[0:37:00]** I'll do one with the trio with the drummer and one with the trio with Graham.

**[0:37:04]** And the label love the idea because Capri Records is not a mega mega corporation.

**[0:37:11]** So basically he's getting two records for the price of one.

**[0:37:14]** Right.

**[0:37:15]** And and it's just twice the work for me.

**[0:37:18]** So I was going to say, you volunteered to do all of the extra work

**[0:37:21]** and they didn't have to. I'm an idiot. Yeah, let's.

**[0:37:23]** That isn't clear to everyone listening now.

**[0:37:27]** I am an idiot and you know, not only are there to be killer bands

**[0:37:31]** that Jonesy has assembled here, but if you have not gone to VIX,

**[0:37:35]** it is a great Vegas. It's a nice room.

**[0:37:38]** It's really the sound too.

**[0:37:40]** I mean, besides the fact that the staff and the food is great

**[0:37:45]** and the staff is amazing and everybody wants to be polite and helpful.

**[0:37:50]** The room, I believe I may be talking out of my ass,

**[0:37:53]** which I have been since I got on the call,

**[0:37:55]** but I believe that the room was designed by the guy

**[0:37:59]** that did the Jazz at Lincoln Center room.

**[0:38:00]** They brought him in for the acoustics.

**[0:38:03]** And I'm telling you, you can play that place with no amplification.

**[0:38:07]** It's 88 seats.

**[0:38:09]** And is that a reference to the it is?

**[0:38:12]** It is one for every key on on the saxophone, right?

**[0:38:15]** I would have to be the person at that venue

**[0:38:18]** that is in charge of making sure they're always exactly 88 seats.

**[0:38:24]** I'm sorry, we can't let you both in.

**[0:38:27]** We can only let one of you in.

**[0:38:28]** We can let eight more people in and we'll call it a Bosendorfer

**[0:38:32]** because they have.

**[0:38:34]** Oh, but no, and it's but the room is great.

**[0:38:38]** The sound is great and they record really well.

**[0:38:41]** And I think it's going to be a really fun time

**[0:38:44]** or it's going to be something that people want to witness for other reasons.

**[0:38:48]** You know, I'll be having a meltdown on stage doing the 14th of a song.

**[0:38:53]** None of it's right. None of it's right.

**[0:38:55]** You know, no, no, because I'm going to warn everyone, you know,

**[0:38:58]** they know we're putting all the social media is saying live album recording.

**[0:39:02]** So and I was on I was on Sunday School

**[0:39:06]** and I said to Penn, Penn said, oh, so you can tell them if they heckle,

**[0:39:09]** it'll come on to the record.

**[0:39:11]** And, you know, I said, oh, that's great, you know, I and the hecklers

**[0:39:15]** will get are like, wait a minute, that's the Mixolydian mode.

**[0:39:19]** Did you just play a flat five on that chord?

**[0:39:22]** What's wrong with you?

**[0:39:23]** Yeah, jazz, jazz, hecklers are the worst.

**[0:39:27]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:39:29]** Wait, did was was that a Bill Evans quote you just played?

**[0:39:33]** Come on.

**[0:39:35]** But but anyhow, it'll be no, it'll be a lot of fun.

**[0:39:40]** And and I'm really I've been trying to get this done for two years.

**[0:39:44]** And I think that, you know, I so I in preparation, I had my head cut open.

**[0:39:50]** So, um, yeah, yeah.

**[0:39:53]** Because, you know, I said to Jen, I hope your Photoshop skills are good enough.

**[0:39:58]** You're not going to wear a fancy hat.

**[0:40:00]** Well, here's the problem.

**[0:40:02]** I probably will wear a fancy hat, but I tried to wear a fancy hat

**[0:40:07]** in the show last night.

**[0:40:08]** We were back at the Rio and I wore on one of the hat from blue

**[0:40:12]** kazoo bit, which is a fancy hat.

**[0:40:15]** I mean, those hats like or expensive.

**[0:40:18]** And I had a lot of Kazoo is outrageous.

**[0:40:20]** Well, the budget was through the roof.

**[0:40:24]** I mean, but I look horrible in hats.

**[0:40:28]** I just don't have a head for hats and but I put it on and Penn says to me,

**[0:40:35]** it looks like it's going to fall off your head.

**[0:40:36]** Pull it down.

**[0:40:37]** It's supposed to be, you know, and so I put it down because, yeah,

**[0:40:39]** that's a lot better.

**[0:40:40]** So I wore it for the whole pre-show, right?

**[0:40:42]** And I come back to my dressing room and from here to here is bright purple.

**[0:40:52]** All of the front of your head.

**[0:40:53]** You're holding your whole forehead.

**[0:40:55]** Yeah.

**[0:40:56]** And I'm like, oh my God, I screwed up everything.

**[0:40:59]** It cut off the blood flow.

**[0:41:01]** What's going to happen?

**[0:41:02]** I go to go to the emergency room because I don't worry about anything.

**[0:41:06]** And and it's like there was like a ridge and it had just like cut the

**[0:41:10]** because I guess because it's just all sensitive from the surgery.

**[0:41:14]** And they pull all your skin together so it gets super tight.

**[0:41:18]** Oh, yeah.

**[0:41:19]** So for three nights, I couldn't sleep because if I did this,

**[0:41:22]** it hurt up here.

**[0:41:23]** Ah, you know, and touch your chin and the top of your head would start hurting.

**[0:41:28]** Yeah.

**[0:41:29]** Really?

**[0:41:29]** Seriously.

**[0:41:30]** I was trying to shave yesterday.

**[0:41:31]** I'm like, oh, um, but so anyways, but luckily it's gone away now.

**[0:41:35]** And I think I'll be okay.

**[0:41:36]** But that goes that idea for that hat.

**[0:41:39]** In the chat is suggesting maybe you could use one of our

**[0:41:42]** fezzes.

**[0:41:42]** We do have patented, well, I thought about that.

**[0:41:46]** I also thought about, um, uh, you know, like, um, just like, uh,

**[0:41:51]** a Nick cap, like I'm going on a killing spree.

**[0:41:54]** Um, I'm like a dainty bonnet or something like that.

**[0:41:58]** Have you thought that would be recommended to do rag?

**[0:42:01]** A full ball of club.

**[0:42:02]** It would be kind of wild.

**[0:42:03]** You know, um, just look at the chat.

**[0:42:06]** It says a chef's hat, a chef's hat would be great.

**[0:42:09]** Yeah.

**[0:42:09]** Well, the problem is, and I mean, I know we're all just joking,

**[0:42:12]** but the problem is they all have a thing that will cut off the circulation.

**[0:42:16]** Not this.

**[0:42:17]** This, this is not.

**[0:42:18]** Is it?

**[0:42:19]** No, no, no, no, no.

**[0:42:21]** I figured it out.

**[0:42:23]** Bucket of chicken, bucket of chicken.

**[0:42:25]** Right over the, yeah, yeah.

**[0:42:28]** Bucket head, jazz bucket head.

**[0:42:30]** I tribute the bucket head.

**[0:42:32]** Oh, you know, that'd be awesome.

**[0:42:34]** Won't touch the head at all.

**[0:42:36]** No lamp lampshade would also work.

**[0:42:39]** Yeah, lampshade.

**[0:42:40]** Yeah.

**[0:42:40]** You could do, you could do a popcorn bucket and cut a hole at the top

**[0:42:45]** and be like, I'm wearing this completely wrong.

**[0:42:48]** Right.

**[0:42:54]** I'm bad at this, but I need one of those things that they, you know,

**[0:42:58]** they screw on your head for brain surgery, you know, a halo, a halo,

**[0:43:03]** and they just drape something over it.

**[0:43:06]** Now you're thinking, I know this is the kind of thoughts that get you,

**[0:43:10]** get you a real, real career.

**[0:43:13]** But anyhow, no, it'll, it'll all be fine.

**[0:43:15]** But, but it's healing up well and hopefully by the time I play

**[0:43:21]** the Green Mill next week, I won't have to have a bandage or hat.

**[0:43:24]** Well, I'll need a hat for Chicago, but, but it's, yeah, but it's,

**[0:43:29]** it's, it's the, the, the Monday night thing is going to be

**[0:43:35]** something that I've been looking forward to for a few years.

**[0:43:38]** But also, yeah, there's a little bit of pressure on me,

**[0:43:41]** but it's, I think that the joy will outweigh the pressure.

**[0:43:45]** You want the pressure, you need the pressure, you need it.

**[0:43:48]** Yeah, yeah, it's a pressure cooker.

**[0:43:50]** No pressure, no diamonds.

**[0:43:51]** I perform best when under pressure.

**[0:43:54]** No, I think that the fun will weigh out.

**[0:43:56]** Beautiful jazz is best under pressure.

**[0:43:59]** Damn right.

**[0:44:00]** Well, all of the stuff that I'm doing for this, like producing it,

**[0:44:06]** and Jen, of course, is like making all this shit happen too.

**[0:44:11]** This is not the way I make records.

**[0:44:12]** Usually the company says, we got a recording date and who do you

**[0:44:18]** want on it?

**[0:44:18]** And I go into the studio and I make it.

**[0:44:21]** But this record and the record before this, I'm doing all the

**[0:44:25]** work because the label is in Colorado and he can't leave to

**[0:44:29]** come to Vegas.

**[0:44:30]** And the last record was with Penn and Jeff Hamilton.

**[0:44:33]** So I have to make sure that Jeff Hamilton is happy and I

**[0:44:36]** have to book the studio and I have to do, you know, and

**[0:44:38]** all this stuff, I'm incompetent.

**[0:44:40]** I don't, I can barely fucking feed myself.

**[0:44:42]** You know, so I, you know, it's all of that on top of trying to

**[0:44:49]** play good songs for people and not, you know, make a fool of

**[0:44:52]** myself as a musician.

**[0:44:54]** You know, it's just a lot of different pressure.

**[0:44:55]** But, but it's, but it's fine.

**[0:44:57]** I mean, we get, we'll get there.

**[0:44:59]** It'll be fun.

**[0:45:00]** And, and they wisely give us a meal.

**[0:45:05]** So I know that I'm really just working for food at the

**[0:45:08]** end of the, you know, when the recording's done, I get

**[0:45:12]** fed.

**[0:45:12]** It doesn't matter what level of fame or fortune the musician is

**[0:45:17]** at.

**[0:45:17]** If you give them food, they're going to be thrilled.

**[0:45:21]** Right.

**[0:45:22]** Absolutely.

**[0:45:23]** I mean, I, you know, and I mean, I, you know, I say that

**[0:45:26]** by you go to, you go to craft services, you after, after

**[0:45:29]** the, after the, uh, after the sound check and, you know,

**[0:45:34]** my bosses are down there.

**[0:45:35]** They're eating, you know, because, you know, that's

**[0:45:39]** what you do.

**[0:45:40]** I mean, it's, it's, it's the risk.

**[0:45:42]** It's the reward for a, you know, a lifetime spent

**[0:45:44]** banging on a piano.

**[0:45:45]** You get a free meal once in a while.

**[0:45:47]** If you ever want to just like please an artist, just

**[0:45:50]** feed them.

**[0:45:51]** If you just feed the artist, they will be, they

**[0:45:53]** will be so happy.

**[0:45:54]** I know I am.

**[0:45:56]** I forgot, Mike, that your, uh, that your camera

**[0:45:58]** follows you around with the, uh, with the AI thing.

**[0:46:01]** So when you just leaned over to get a drink out

**[0:46:03]** of your cup, I was really wondering why you

**[0:46:05]** were moving the camera to follow yourself to get

**[0:46:08]** that drink.

**[0:46:09]** I see, I see.

**[0:46:10]** Yeah.

**[0:46:10]** Yeah.

**[0:46:10]** I was like, man, he is really into this camera thing.

**[0:46:14]** Damn right.

**[0:46:15]** I, um, but, uh, no, it's, you know, it's, it's funny

**[0:46:19]** when I was doing gigs in, in, in, in Boston, when

**[0:46:23]** I got out of college and, uh, I did the whole

**[0:46:27]** circuit.

**[0:46:27]** Like there were 40 or 50 places in Boston that

**[0:46:30]** had live music every night from like five

**[0:46:34]** o'clock at night till nine.

**[0:46:35]** There was a shift and then nine to one.

**[0:46:37]** And I played a lot of cocktail shifts and a

**[0:46:40]** lot of night shifts and all of these places,

**[0:46:45]** their reputation among musicians was who had

**[0:46:49]** the best employee cafeteria.

**[0:46:50]** Yep.

**[0:46:51]** You know, uh, that's all we cared about.

**[0:46:54]** It's like, oh man, I got a gig next Friday

**[0:46:56]** night at the Ritz, you know, and you would go

**[0:46:59]** up to the top floor on the Ritz and the

**[0:47:01]** food up there was better than most restaurants

**[0:47:05]** for the employees, you know, and if you

**[0:47:07]** didn't like what they were offering, they

**[0:47:10]** would make you a burger, which at the time a

**[0:47:13]** Ritz burger was like $20, you know, and they

**[0:47:18]** would just make it for you and you would go

**[0:47:20]** up there and they would have like a prime

**[0:47:22]** rib hash that was out for the, for the, for

**[0:47:25]** the, in the street bar that, you know, I

**[0:47:27]** mean, this stuff was, I still think about

**[0:47:29]** that, you know, we're talking about it.

**[0:47:33]** Well, it's so funny and I'm going off, I'm

**[0:47:36]** taking up your whole show.

**[0:47:37]** Well, what the hell, why not?

**[0:47:38]** You were stupid enough to have me.

**[0:47:41]** I would, I would see these old musicians,

**[0:47:43]** like guys that I worshiped when I was in

**[0:47:46]** Boston and I got lucky enough to be friends

**[0:47:47]** with and play with and I'd be on this

**[0:47:49]** gig after seeing Dave McKenna, who was a

**[0:47:52]** great jazz pianist, and I would be in a

**[0:47:54]** room with Dave McKenna and Dick Johnson,

**[0:47:56]** who was a great clarinetist who led

**[0:47:58]** the Artie Shaw band and he's, these

**[0:48:00]** guys are legendary musicians and Herb

**[0:48:02]** Pomeray and Dick Johnson and Gray

**[0:48:04]** Sargent and all the guys from, from

**[0:48:07]** Boston and they all played, I mean,

**[0:48:10]** Herb Pomeray played with Charlie Parker,

**[0:48:12]** you know, that's the level of these

**[0:48:14]** musicians and I'm sitting there as a 22

**[0:48:16]** year old guy wanting to suck up all the

**[0:48:18]** all the stories and all the energy and

**[0:48:21]** you know what they talked about?

**[0:48:22]** Oh, remember that diner on Route 9?

**[0:48:25]** The fucking mashed potatoes there were

**[0:48:27]** unbelievable, you know, and Dave

**[0:48:30]** McKenna's like, oh, this white pizza

**[0:48:32]** at this place in Hartford, I'd do

**[0:48:33]** the gig just for that.

**[0:48:35]** That's what they're talking about,

**[0:48:36]** you know, I played with Ella Fitzgerald

**[0:48:40]** for six nights and, you know, they don't

**[0:48:42]** care, they're like, that's food, food,

**[0:48:43]** food is important, that's what I've

**[0:48:46]** learned in life.

**[0:48:50]** Jonesy, when do you think the albums

**[0:48:52]** are going to come out?

**[0:48:54]** What?

**[0:48:55]** When do you think the albums are going

**[0:48:56]** to drop?

**[0:48:57]** Oh, the albums? Oh, not until, I mean,

**[0:49:00]** with Locke, you know, Spring or Summer

**[0:49:04]** of 26.

**[0:49:06]** Okay.

**[0:49:07]** I mean, I'm going to push them a little

**[0:49:09]** bit more, you know, maybe even as soon

**[0:49:12]** as March or April for one of them.

**[0:49:13]** I don't know if they'll do two of them

**[0:49:15]** at the same time.

**[0:49:16]** I don't know, you know, as I said,

**[0:49:18]** in dealing with all of the machinations

**[0:49:22]** to make these records,

**[0:49:23]** Johnny Katz asked me what the title

**[0:49:25]** was going to be, and I said,

**[0:49:26]** we don't have them titled yet,

**[0:49:28]** which we don't.

**[0:49:29]** But as I said to Jen, the title

**[0:49:31]** of the first one is going to be

**[0:49:32]** Never Again.

**[0:49:34]** And the title of the second one is

**[0:49:36]** Somebody Kill Me.

**[0:49:39]** This was your chance to see me do this.

**[0:49:41]** I'm not doing it again.

**[0:49:42]** Yes, exactly.

**[0:49:43]** Title.

**[0:49:43]** Exactly.

**[0:49:44]** No, no, I mean, I will come up with

**[0:49:46]** something, you know, a little bit,

**[0:50:32]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:50:33]** It's tough to get him out of his shell.

**[0:50:35]** One day, one day, though,

**[0:50:37]** he's going to really start talking.

**[0:50:39]** Retiring Violet that Jonesy.

**[0:50:41]** Yeah.

**[0:50:42]** He's a fascinating dude.

**[0:50:44]** He is absolutely.

**[0:50:44]** And that podcast is great.

**[0:50:46]** I've listened to a couple episodes.

**[0:50:47]** Yes.

**[0:50:48]** He gets deep with some of his guests.

**[0:50:51]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:50:52]** Well, they're talking about like

**[0:50:53]** a personal relationship with music,

**[0:50:54]** which is always, it's always going

**[0:50:56]** to be fascinating.

**[0:50:57]** And then you add knowledge into it

**[0:50:58]** on top of it.

**[0:50:59]** And it's, it's a, it's a really,

**[0:51:00]** it's a really great thing.

**[0:51:01]** Coming from a very educated place.

**[0:51:03]** Yeah.

**[0:51:05]** Well, I had a Scoopity hero picked out

**[0:51:07]** because Jonesy was with us.

**[0:51:09]** He's gone now.

**[0:51:10]** We're going to play it anyway.

**[0:51:11]** Here comes a Scoopity.

**[0:51:15]** Ladies and gentlemen, it is.

**[0:51:40]** We got a Scoopity coming to us today

**[0:51:41]** from the OG Scoop.

**[0:51:44]** The categories are

**[0:51:45]** rock with strings,

**[0:51:47]** bond theme artists

**[0:51:48]** from Broadway to pop

**[0:51:49]** and old ass songs.

**[0:51:51]** That's right.

**[0:51:51]** It's a music Scoopity.

**[0:51:53]** Oh, I'm first.

**[0:51:54]** Well, I'll start top left corner.

**[0:51:56]** Rock with strings for 200.

**[0:51:57]** Kansas basically says

**[0:51:59]** we are all dirt in this 70s classic.

**[0:52:06]** It's the shit.

**[0:52:09]** The name of the song.

**[0:52:10]** Dust of the Wind.

**[0:52:10]** Horse with no name.

**[0:52:12]** Horse with no name.

**[0:52:14]** Dust of the Wind is it.

**[0:52:17]** Matt, you're up.

**[0:52:19]** I'll do rock with strings for 400.

**[0:52:22]** Let's see here.

**[0:52:24]** This moody blues song

**[0:52:26]** speaks of written letters

**[0:52:27]** that were never meant to be sent.

**[0:52:35]** Knights and white satin.

**[0:52:37]** I think so.

**[0:52:38]** All right.

**[0:52:39]** That's a white satin.

**[0:52:40]** Knights and white satin.

**[0:52:43]** Letters I've written

**[0:52:45]** never meant to be sent.

**[0:52:51]** I'll do rock with strings for 800.

**[0:52:53]** Let's go.

**[0:52:53]** Whoa, skip it over.

**[0:52:55]** This Zeppelin song name

**[0:52:57]** drops a region of the Indian subcontinent.

**[0:53:02]** Yeah, you're glad you skipped over

**[0:53:03]** the $800 question now, aren't you?

**[0:53:06]** Cashmere, I think.

**[0:53:08]** Let's try it.

**[0:53:10]** It's cashmere.

**[0:53:11]** Damn it.

**[0:53:14]** See, I always thought it was

**[0:53:15]** referring to Ed Wood's sweaters,

**[0:53:19]** but I guess I was wrong.

**[0:53:20]** You thought Zeppelin made it.

**[0:53:24]** He played all the coffee houses

**[0:53:25]** when I was coming up.

**[0:53:27]** As the 90s, there's a lot of coffee houses.

**[0:53:30]** Scott Hathaway would mic his guitar

**[0:53:33]** super all over the place,

**[0:53:35]** and he would play cashmere

**[0:53:36]** by wearing a jangly bracelet,

**[0:53:40]** hitting certain guitar strings,

**[0:53:41]** and playing the drums

**[0:53:42]** on the bottom of the guitar.

**[0:53:44]** It was insane.

**[0:53:44]** Yeah, yeah.

**[0:53:45]** It was a little...

**[0:53:46]** I've seen people do that.

**[0:53:47]** It's a little one-man bandy.

**[0:53:49]** Yeah, and my son,

**[0:53:52]** my youngest son brought up

**[0:53:53]** a clip of someone doing that

**[0:53:55]** who was younger and doing it,

**[0:53:57]** and I, as proud dad moment,

**[0:54:00]** bit my tongue and didn't say,

**[0:54:02]** I know someone who did that

**[0:54:02]** when I was young also.

**[0:54:04]** I just let him appreciate

**[0:54:05]** the new young guy doing it

**[0:54:06]** for the first time.

**[0:54:06]** Smart, smart.

**[0:54:07]** You know, for the first time.

**[0:54:07]** Smart.

**[0:54:08]** And I was like, yep.

**[0:54:10]** That's awesome.

**[0:54:10]** Way to find that.

**[0:54:11]** Way to discover that.

**[0:54:12]** Way to discover this brand new thing.

**[0:54:15]** No one has done before.

**[0:54:17]** Yeah.

**[0:54:18]** I'll say it's me.

**[0:54:19]** I'll try an old-ass song.

**[0:54:22]** It's 200.

**[0:54:23]** This Queen song is almost always

**[0:54:25]** played with their song Bicycle Race.

**[0:54:29]** Which one do they play with Bicycle Race?

**[0:54:37]** I'm going to feel really dumb here in a second.

**[0:54:38]** I'm going to pass.

**[0:54:39]** Matt.

**[0:54:40]** I think it's Fat Bottom Girls.

**[0:54:42]** Is it?

**[0:54:42]** All right, let's try it.

**[0:54:43]** It is Fat Bottom Girls.

**[0:54:45]** Look at that.

**[0:54:46]** Yeah.

**[0:54:47]** Matt.

**[0:54:47]** Miss, I always play them together.

**[0:54:49]** Smart.

**[0:54:51]** I will do...

**[0:54:54]** Let's go from Broadway to pop.

**[0:54:58]** Daily Double!

**[0:55:04]** Yvonne Ellman had this hit from Jesus Christ Superstar.

**[0:55:11]** Go get Jesus and hang him on the cross.

**[0:55:17]** What's the hit from Jesus Christ Superstar?

**[0:55:20]** Oh, there's a random.

**[0:55:20]** I need this problem like I need a hole in my hand.

**[0:55:29]** So I can't get the fuck down.

**[0:55:31]** Someone needs the wood.

**[0:55:36]** I'm going to shroud up Turin all over your face.

**[0:55:43]** Man, it's a Daily Double, so I have to guess.

**[0:55:45]** It is.

**[0:55:46]** Let's see.

**[0:55:47]** Jesus Christ Superstar.

**[0:55:49]** It's got all the Judas songs.

**[0:55:50]** Creepers, creepers.

**[0:55:51]** Where'd you get those peepers?

**[0:55:53]** Sure, yeah.

**[0:55:57]** Creepers, creepers.

**[0:55:58]** Where'd you get those eyes?

**[0:55:59]** Rubba dub dub.

**[0:56:00]** I was washing my feet in the tub.

**[0:56:03]** Yep.

**[0:56:06]** One, two, three, four.

**[0:56:08]** It's Jesus.

**[0:56:09]** Five, six, seven.

**[0:56:10]** Eight o'clock.

**[0:56:11]** It's Jesus.

**[0:56:14]** I'll just say Jesus Christ Superstar is the hit.

**[0:56:16]** There you go.

**[0:56:17]** Let's try it.

**[0:56:18]** I don't know how to love him.

**[0:56:21]** I don't know how to...

**[0:56:22]** I'll also let's play the game.

**[0:56:23]** I don't know how to love him.

**[0:56:24]** It's also what the answer to this.

**[0:56:28]** Paul, you're up.

**[0:56:30]** I will also try from Broadway to pop.

**[0:56:33]** Let's try it.

**[0:56:34]** This Wicked song was inescapable in the early 2000s.

**[0:56:39]** It gotta be.

**[0:56:40]** I believe it's Let It Go.

**[0:56:41]** No, it got me defying gravity.

**[0:56:45]** No, I'm sorry, Paul.

**[0:56:47]** It was Letting Go.

**[0:56:48]** Letting Go from Wicked.

**[0:56:52]** I have green skin.

**[0:56:53]** Please don't eat the green snow.

**[0:56:57]** I'll try.

**[0:56:58]** Let's see.

**[0:56:59]** Broadway to pop, 600.

**[0:57:00]** Oh, shit.

**[0:57:01]** I did the wrong thing.

**[0:57:02]** I did old-ass songs.

**[0:57:03]** According to Trace Atkins, the subject of this song

**[0:57:05]** has got it going on like Donkey Kong.

**[0:57:09]** Oh, you know, for a second, I thought I wasn't going to know

**[0:57:13]** the answer to the question that I accidentally clicked on for myself.

**[0:57:16]** Now you do that.

**[0:57:17]** Fortunately, fortunately, it's the song that is my wake-up tone.

**[0:57:20]** It plays on my alarm every morning.

**[0:57:23]** I listen to it before I go to bed at night.

**[0:57:25]** It is, of course, honky-tonk, but donk-a-donk.

**[0:57:29]** Correct.

**[0:57:30]** Yes.

**[0:57:32]** Matt, you're up.

**[0:57:34]** By the way, that was from old-ass songs, not from Broadway to pop.

**[0:57:38]** Oh, good.

**[0:57:39]** I would hope.

**[0:57:41]** Rock with strings for 600, please.

**[0:57:44]** ELO added strings to this amazing cover of a Chuck Berry tune.

**[0:57:53]** I don't know.

**[0:57:53]** Pass.

**[0:57:55]** Paul.

**[0:57:59]** Well, goodness.

**[0:58:00]** I think this is also let it go.

**[0:58:02]** It could be my dingaling.

**[0:58:06]** It's the string version of my dingaling.

**[0:58:09]** Well, Silver Bell's hanging out his string.

**[0:58:12]** I'll pass.

**[0:58:14]** Oh, that passes to me.

**[0:58:15]** I don't know.

**[0:58:15]** I'll pass.

**[0:58:18]** Roll over Beethoven.

**[0:58:20]** Roll over Beethoven.

**[0:58:21]** I've never heard the ELO version of that.

**[0:58:23]** I don't think I have either.

**[0:58:25]** Paul, you're up.

**[0:58:26]** Tchaikovsky, the news.

**[0:58:27]** Broadway to pop, please.

**[0:58:29]** A first-sex hundo.

**[0:58:31]** Susan Boyle's shocked judges on Britain's Got Talent with this song from Lemis Robles.

**[0:58:37]** Uh.

**[0:58:37]** Lemis Robles.

**[0:58:39]** Lemis Robles.

**[0:58:40]** Me if you don't believe.

**[0:58:42]** It was, uh, I don't know how to love it.

**[0:58:48]** It was a castle on a cloud.

**[0:58:51]** Yeah, right.

**[0:58:51]** That's my favorite, but I ain't doing that anymore.

**[0:58:53]** This is the song that I sang.

**[0:58:58]** Oh, is it?

**[0:58:59]** No, it's not.

**[0:58:59]** Keeper of the Zoo.

**[0:59:01]** Not where is love.

**[0:59:04]** Uh, what's love got to do?

**[0:59:06]** Oliver.

**[0:59:06]** Got to do with it.

**[0:59:07]** Where is love is from Oliver?

**[0:59:09]** Uh, shit.

**[0:59:10]** What is this one?

**[0:59:12]** Please, sir, can I ask some more?

**[0:59:14]** I have to pass.

**[0:59:14]** I don't know.

**[0:59:15]** Uh, it passes to me.

**[0:59:17]** What is it?

**[0:59:17]** What did she sing from Britain?

**[0:59:19]** Yeah, I don't remember.

**[0:59:21]** Well, that's the whole question, isn't it?

**[0:59:22]** Um, the master of the house.

**[0:59:25]** This is not the song that she would have sung on the talent show.

**[0:59:29]** It's not the I'm John Valjean song.

**[0:59:31]** It's probably not on John Valjean.

**[0:59:33]** No, it's probably not.

**[0:59:34]** Yeah, it's probably not.

**[0:59:35]** Oh, my.

**[0:59:37]** I'm Susan Boyle.

**[0:59:40]** Oh, that'd be great.

**[0:59:42]** That is so great.

**[0:59:46]** Um, it fits the meter.

**[0:59:49]** Empty chairs at empty tables.

**[0:59:51]** That doesn't feel right.

**[0:59:52]** Oh, my God, dude.

**[0:59:54]** Have you heard the empty chairs at empty tables?

**[0:59:57]** Muppets mash up.

**[0:59:59]** No, no, Christ.

**[1:00:01]** The Muppets did they miss it?

**[1:00:02]** No, it just fits to.

**[1:00:05]** It fits perfectly with the Muppet show intro.

**[1:00:09]** And it's just as haunting and tragic.

**[1:00:13]** That's great.

**[1:00:15]** All right, I have to look for it or send it to me.

**[1:00:17]** I will.

**[1:00:17]** Why am I looking for it?

**[1:00:18]** You send it to me.

**[1:00:19]** Um, I don't, I got to pass.

**[1:00:21]** Matt.

**[1:00:23]** It's a dream of dream.

**[1:00:24]** Oh, it's the only song I couldn't think of from lay this.

**[1:00:27]** Yeah, I couldn't remember it myself.

**[1:00:29]** Matt just knew it.

**[1:00:30]** Yeah.

**[1:00:31]** Uh, it's me.

**[1:00:32]** I'll try.

**[1:00:32]** I'll close up.

**[1:00:33]** Pop Broadway 800 or Broadway to pop.

**[1:00:35]** You know what I mean?

**[1:00:36]** Abba songwriters, Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ylvisis,

**[1:00:39]** along with Tim Rice, pinned this tune from chess.

**[1:00:44]** I had no idea that anybody from Abba worked on chess,

**[1:00:48]** so I'm going to pass.

**[1:00:49]** Matt.

**[1:00:55]** Shoot, my wife loves chess.

**[1:00:57]** Everyone loves the soundtrack to chess and no one loves the show.

**[1:01:00]** That's exactly right.

**[1:01:02]** Um, I mean, this is the one hit.

**[1:01:04]** I got it.

**[1:01:04]** You got it.

**[1:01:06]** It's a one night in Bangkok.

**[1:01:11]** That's what you're going with?

**[1:01:12]** Yeah.

**[1:01:14]** It's one night in Bangkok.

**[1:01:15]** Yeah.

**[1:01:16]** That's just right.

**[1:01:17]** It's the only song there is in chess to have made of hit.

**[1:01:20]** I don't know.

**[1:01:21]** I don't know.

**[1:01:21]** I don't know.

**[1:01:21]** I don't know any songs to chess.

**[1:01:22]** It's a man playing chess.

**[1:01:25]** I don't know.

**[1:01:26]** You're right.

**[1:01:27]** I don't know why.

**[1:01:29]** I need more credit.

**[1:01:30]** More credit.

**[1:01:31]** Paul's right.

**[1:01:33]** Paul's right, everyone.

**[1:01:35]** One night in Bangkok and your cock gets banged on.

**[1:01:40]** Um, Matt, you got Bond theme artists or old ass songs.

**[1:01:43]** What you want?

**[1:01:45]** Hand me that hammer gun.

**[1:01:47]** I'm going to bang some cock.

**[1:01:50]** For one night.

**[1:01:54]** Bangkok, Oriental city where you have to bring your hammer

**[1:01:56]** because hammers ain't cheap.

**[1:01:58]** How about an old ass song?

**[1:02:04]** Bring your hammer and disinfect it because you're going to be

**[1:02:06]** banging on your cock all night.

**[1:02:09]** Casey and the Sunshine Band got scores of us to do this in the 70s.

**[1:02:14]** Have unprotected sex.

**[1:02:19]** Oh, Casey and the Sunshine Band.

**[1:02:21]** There's several possible answers here.

**[1:02:23]** There's several possible answers here.

**[1:02:25]** I think it's good.

**[1:02:27]** Two little dance and make a little love get down tonight or let's try it.

**[1:02:30]** Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

**[1:02:33]** Oh shoot.

**[1:02:34]** It's going to be that.

**[1:02:35]** It's going to be that.

**[1:02:38]** What is it, Matt?

**[1:02:39]** What's your final answer?

**[1:02:40]** You got to pick one.

**[1:02:43]** Your answer fits better to a question than mine does.

**[1:02:45]** I think that's why I went there is shake your booty.

**[1:02:48]** You see you're going to shake your booty?

**[1:02:49]** Yeah, shake your booty.

**[1:02:49]** Let's try it.

**[1:02:50]** It is shake, shake, shake, shake your booty.

**[1:02:54]** There we go.

**[1:02:55]** Way to go, Matt.

**[1:02:56]** You and your booty.

**[1:02:57]** Get that right.

**[1:02:57]** Paul.

**[1:02:59]** Phew.

**[1:03:01]** Bond theme artist.

**[1:03:03]** What the hell?

**[1:03:04]** Let's see.

**[1:03:05]** A singer of nobody does it better from the spy who loved me.

**[1:03:12]** I think that's Eartha Kitt.

**[1:03:15]** Let's try it.

**[1:03:16]** Eartha Kitt.

**[1:03:17]** Carly Simon.

**[1:03:18]** Shit on me.

**[1:03:19]** The Eartha Kitt of James Bond music.

**[1:03:23]** The Carly Simon of Eartha Kitt.

**[1:03:27]** It's me.

**[1:03:28]** I'll close out old ass songs for 400.

**[1:03:30]** Sir Mixolot's favorite body part of the opposite sex is obvious from this song.

**[1:03:37]** I believe it's my humps, my hulumps, my lovely lady lumps.

**[1:03:43]** My Sir Mixolot.

**[1:03:45]** That would be the butt song.

**[1:03:48]** Baby got back.

**[1:03:50]** Yeah, there it is.

**[1:03:54]** Matt, you got Bond theme artist for four, six, or eight.

**[1:03:59]** I had to really shuffle through all of the Sir Mixolot hits in my brain to get to that one.

**[1:04:06]** I'll go.

**[1:04:08]** Did Mixolot do one of the Bond things?

**[1:04:10]** He did.

**[1:04:11]** Under a suit in him though.

**[1:04:13]** Oh yeah, score check.

**[1:04:14]** Paul has 1800.

**[1:04:15]** Matt has 1400.

**[1:04:16]** I have 1200.

**[1:04:18]** I think there's a daily double left as well in one of these three questions.

**[1:04:22]** I like James Bond and I cannot lie.

**[1:04:25]** You other spies can't deny.

**[1:04:29]** When a guy rolls in with a car with tricks and shoots somebody from the roof.

**[1:04:34]** It's James Bond's car.

**[1:04:39]** Um, all right, this is Bond theme artist for 400.

**[1:04:42]** Let's see it.

**[1:04:43]** Not Guns and Roses, but this group recorded the soundtrack theme from Live and Let Die First.

**[1:04:51]** That'd be Big Buckethead.

**[1:04:53]** Big Buckethead, of course.

**[1:04:57]** What was the name of that group?

**[1:04:59]** Paul McCartney, but do I have to?

**[1:05:00]** But it was a group?

**[1:05:02]** Yeah, it's a band.

**[1:05:03]** Oh, Wings.

**[1:05:04]** Wings, there you go.

**[1:05:06]** Paul McCartney and Wings.

**[1:05:09]** Paul, you got theme artists for six or 800.

**[1:05:13]** You're currently tied with Matt at 1800.

**[1:05:17]** Yeah.

**[1:05:17]** Uh, yeah, I'll go 800.

**[1:05:21]** 800.

**[1:05:21]** Let's go.

**[1:05:22]** Let's go.

**[1:05:22]** 800.

**[1:05:23]** Yeah.

**[1:05:23]** It's the Daily Double.

**[1:05:25]** I knew it.

**[1:05:26]** I knew it.

**[1:05:26]** Now it's for 1800.

**[1:05:28]** But I had to do this.

**[1:05:30]** You had to.

**[1:05:31]** I did.

**[1:05:32]** In my opinion, this Goldfinger theme singer started the tradition of epic Bond songs.

**[1:05:39]** If that's your opinion, OG Scoop, you're correct.

**[1:05:43]** I think this is Eartha Kitt.

**[1:05:46]** Oh, it is not.

**[1:05:48]** Oh, fuck me.

**[1:05:49]** It is Shirley Bassey.

**[1:05:50]** My ass.

**[1:05:52]** Shirley Bassey.

**[1:05:53]** My ass.

**[1:05:55]** Oh, I clicked the wrong thing.

**[1:05:57]** I clicked it.

**[1:05:58]** Paul got it right, which he definitely did not.

**[1:06:01]** Bond theme artists for 600.

**[1:06:03]** That's what I'm closing it out with.

**[1:06:05]** This R&B Diva legend graced us all with the theme from license to kill.

**[1:06:09]** This was, of course, Eartha Kitt.

**[1:06:13]** It's not.

**[1:06:14]** It's Gladys Knight.

**[1:06:17]** That's the game.

**[1:06:18]** Did Eartha Kitt do a Bond song?

**[1:06:20]** I don't think so.

**[1:06:20]** No. That's the game.

**[1:06:23]** Matt wins with 1,800 points.

**[1:06:25]** I'm in second with 600 points.

**[1:06:27]** Paul is in third with zero points.

**[1:06:29]** Not according to the scoreboard, though.

**[1:06:31]** According to the scoreboard, Paul crushed us with 3,600 points.

**[1:06:34]** And that's from OG Scoop.

**[1:06:36]** Thank you, OG Scoop.

**[1:06:38]** Because everyone knows Shirley Bassey was literally just Eartha Kitt.

**[1:06:42]** She was.

**[1:06:43]** So there you go.

**[1:06:44]** It was three Shirley Bassey's in a trench coat dressed up as Eartha Kitt.

**[1:06:49]** So do we have time for me to share my winter stories for you?

**[1:06:53]** Well, tell us, Paul.

**[1:06:55]** Tell us.

**[1:06:55]** Oh, let me tell you people this.

**[1:06:56]** If you want to send us a Scoopity, a Price of Scrape,

**[1:06:59]** Jock vs. Nerd, any kind of Jock vs. Nerd, or an email, heyscoops.com.

**[1:07:03]** That's where you can go.

**[1:07:04]** Send us all those things right over there at heyscoops.com.

**[1:07:08]** Paul, do you have a Tale of Winter?

**[1:07:10]** I have a couple.

**[1:07:11]** So it's colder in witches' tit in a brass bra out here.

**[1:07:14]** It's freezing.

**[1:07:14]** And we got our first significant snow the other day.

**[1:07:19]** And it happened between my improv classes.

**[1:07:22]** So one improv class I went to on Monday, no problem.

**[1:07:25]** Tuesday, a little more treacherous.

**[1:07:28]** The roads are pretty fine because out here they know how to deal with snow.

**[1:07:31]** They plow and they salt, and it's all good.

**[1:07:34]** So the roads are not a problem.

**[1:07:36]** They plow, they salt, they plow, they salt, plow and salt, salt and plow.

**[1:07:41]** You may remember.

**[1:07:42]** Just fine, it's fine, it's fine.

**[1:07:44]** You may remember outside of the Skit Theatre area,

**[1:07:47]** there is a large section of stairs.

**[1:07:51]** Do you recall these stairs?

**[1:07:52]** Oh yes, right.

**[1:07:53]** Okay.

**[1:07:54]** Well, I came upon those stairs on my second night,

**[1:07:57]** not thinking anything of it really.

**[1:08:00]** They looked trot upon, but they didn't look like they weren't snowy.

**[1:08:05]** So I thought, okay, we're fine.

**[1:08:07]** Well, it had gotten to about 35 degrees that day.

**[1:08:10]** Okay.

**[1:08:11]** Then by the time I got to the stairs, it was back down to about 30.

**[1:08:16]** And so the stairs were basically covered in black ice.

**[1:08:21]** I took my first step onto that stairs.

**[1:08:24]** My feet went out from under me.

**[1:08:26]** I was lucky to have hold of the handrail.

**[1:08:29]** I swampled, I didn't fall, I swampled down to my ass onto these frozen stairs.

**[1:08:37]** And I could not get my feet under me for the life of me.

**[1:08:40]** Oh no.

**[1:08:41]** So I scooted on my ass down 15 stairs all the way down on ice.

**[1:08:49]** And my butt was just soaking wet for the rest of class.

**[1:08:53]** It was disgusting.

**[1:08:55]** And in my terror of my near-death experience,

**[1:08:59]** I quickly texted Justin.

**[1:09:01]** I'm like, oh my God, I almost died on the stairs.

**[1:09:04]** You have to tell everybody.

**[1:09:05]** Send emails out.

**[1:09:06]** Someone could really get hurt.

**[1:09:08]** I must have freaked him out.

**[1:09:12]** I was in such a tizzy.

**[1:09:14]** I was in such a tizzy.

**[1:09:15]** You do get in tizzies.

**[1:09:17]** It's bad.

**[1:09:18]** Then last night, it's getting down to 11.

**[1:09:23]** And Anne suddenly remembers, oh, shit.

**[1:09:27]** We don't have the external hose hookup covered for the winter.

**[1:09:31]** And we didn't turn the water off.

**[1:09:33]** That could lead to frozen pipes.

**[1:09:35]** That's not a good thing.

**[1:09:36]** So she turns.

**[1:09:38]** So she remembers this last night at 9 o'clock PM,

**[1:09:42]** when I've been asleep for almost an hour and a half.

**[1:09:46]** And so she wakes me up from a dead sleep to tell me, oh, God,

**[1:09:51]** we've got to get this thing fixed.

**[1:09:54]** Where is this?

**[1:09:55]** She's got like a glove for the pipe.

**[1:09:57]** She's like, where's the glove?

**[1:09:58]** I don't know.

**[1:09:59]** I have no idea where the glove is.

**[1:10:01]** It got removed in the spring when she started doing watering stuff

**[1:10:04]** and it hasn't been replaced.

**[1:10:06]** And I don't know where the fuck it is.

**[1:10:09]** But I managed to go get some pool noodle because I have spare pool

**[1:10:15]** noodle around for such an emergency, cut up some pool noodle,

**[1:10:19]** fashioned a crude glove, if you will, for the external piece.

**[1:10:24]** And we duct taped it up and there you go.

**[1:10:26]** All fixed.

**[1:10:28]** Then I turn around and she is back in bed.

**[1:10:32]** Meanwhile, I'm up.

**[1:10:33]** And I was beside myself that she had been able to go right back

**[1:10:39]** to bed after that so quickly and left me to fiddle with the dogs.

**[1:10:43]** It was really funny to me.

**[1:10:45]** But then this morning I get the call that she got her karmic

**[1:10:51]** comeuppance for waking me in the night.

**[1:10:53]** Oh, good.

**[1:10:55]** It's about time she learns a lesson.

**[1:10:57]** No, this is tragedy.

**[1:11:00]** This is tragedy.

**[1:11:02]** She she's drinking her coffee this morning that she's made out

**[1:11:06]** of her little machine and the coffee is off.

**[1:11:11]** Right.

**[1:11:12]** It's off.

**[1:11:13]** Something's something's really off about the coffee and she

**[1:11:17]** doesn't know what, but she knows it's off and she goes to open

**[1:11:21]** up the coffee machine and there is a stink bug in the coffee

**[1:11:26]** machine and she is beside herself.

**[1:11:30]** She cannot handle this revelation.

**[1:11:33]** This is like, this is the thing that puts her over the edge.

**[1:11:38]** She gets violently ill from the stink bug in the coffee machine.

**[1:11:42]** She's throwing up everywhere.

**[1:11:44]** She's because she's drank stink bug juice.

**[1:11:46]** So she's just like, dear God.

**[1:11:49]** So she's done not only that, not only that, she is so upset

**[1:11:55]** that I had to buy her a new coffee maker today.

**[1:11:59]** She will not use the stink bug.

**[1:12:01]** What?

**[1:12:02]** Fakes in coffee maker.

**[1:12:03]** I said, there's nothing wrong with this coffee maker.

**[1:12:05]** She's like, I can't even look at it.

**[1:12:07]** I can't, I couldn't even be in the kitchen without getting violently ill.

**[1:12:10]** I'm like, okay.

**[1:12:12]** So if there's one Achilles heel on Old McFeeders,

**[1:12:15]** it's stink bugs and liquids.

**[1:12:17]** It's stink bugs.

**[1:12:18]** There you go.

**[1:12:19]** You got to get a new coffee maker and put a fake stink bug in

**[1:12:21]** there just to start it off right.

**[1:12:23]** Lauren Shreve says, if you've smelled stink bug,

**[1:12:25]** you'll understand.

**[1:12:25]** And it's true.

**[1:12:26]** They are foul, foul things.

**[1:12:29]** We didn't have any, we don't have any in Vegas.

**[1:12:31]** Thank God.

**[1:12:32]** They are nasty, nasty critters.

**[1:12:36]** They're really, really gross.

**[1:12:38]** So anyway, she's got a nice new coffee machine now.

**[1:12:42]** And hopefully that will be all good.

**[1:12:45]** We got the small brown ones.

**[1:12:49]** You just get all these, just a bunch of plastic bugs

**[1:12:52]** to just fill the coffee maker with it.

**[1:12:54]** Oh, no, no, don't.

**[1:12:56]** Oh, she'll be so sad.

**[1:12:57]** Don't send fake plastic bugs.

**[1:12:59]** Honestly, she wouldn't care.

**[1:13:00]** A fake plastic bug wouldn't affect the taste of her coffee.

**[1:13:03]** It's the fact that this bug actually

**[1:13:06]** put all kind of goo in her coffee and she drank it.

**[1:13:09]** It was nasty.

**[1:13:11]** Oh, that pervy bug.

**[1:13:13]** What would disinfect it is if you peed all over the old

**[1:13:16]** coffee maker and that would be, that would help.

**[1:13:18]** I told her we could do that.

**[1:13:19]** Well, no, no, that's,

**[1:13:19]** that's if a jellyfish gets into your coffee maker.

**[1:13:22]** It's just as well.

**[1:13:22]** Oh, that's it.

**[1:13:23]** It's an older model.

**[1:13:25]** It still works great.

**[1:13:25]** I'm going to give it to the Goodwill.

**[1:13:27]** Her name is Ann.

**[1:13:29]** Don't call her an older model.

**[1:13:31]** But the other day when she was really, really sick,

**[1:13:35]** I guess it was Thanksgiving day when she was really, really sick.

**[1:13:38]** She was making coffee for herself

**[1:13:40]** and she forgot to put a cup in the machine.

**[1:13:43]** And I came in and I'm like,

**[1:13:45]** Ann, what the fuck?

**[1:13:46]** She was just spilling coffee all over the machine.

**[1:13:49]** And the thing is your coffee maker does that.

**[1:13:51]** Then you do need to get a new coffee maker.

**[1:13:53]** Your coffee maker is out of date.

**[1:13:55]** Yeah.

**[1:13:55]** So she was like, I don't even know what I'm doing.

**[1:13:57]** But it got coffee all in the base of the machine.

**[1:14:00]** So it can go now.

**[1:14:02]** It's, it's, it served its time.

**[1:14:04]** It's time.

**[1:14:05]** Poor thing was, poor thing was just out of it.

**[1:14:07]** Well, I for one, I'm certainly glad

**[1:14:09]** that Ann finally got her comeuppance

**[1:14:11]** for waking you up earlier than you wanted to wake up.

**[1:14:14]** Yeah.

**[1:14:14]** She got her come up and serves her right

**[1:14:16]** in the, in the form of a brand new coffee maker.

**[1:14:21]** No, it's all good.

**[1:14:22]** She's dead right.

**[1:14:23]** And I would be the most upset

**[1:14:24]** if we had any kind of water damage happen,

**[1:14:27]** because that's coming right down here

**[1:14:29]** to the old back cave.

**[1:14:31]** You know, it's not going anywhere but down.

**[1:14:34]** And these, these, I've got plenty of stuff

**[1:14:36]** that won't be too terribly affected

**[1:14:38]** because most of it's all plastic,

**[1:14:40]** but there's plenty of paper down here

**[1:14:42]** to get fucked.

**[1:14:43]** I gotta, I gotta believe Paul,

**[1:14:44]** even if you weren't there,

**[1:14:45]** I think if the basement started flooding,

**[1:14:47]** I think the squirrel would get

**[1:14:49]** most of the stuff out of the basement.

**[1:14:50]** I think the squirrel would save

**[1:14:51]** most of the possessions down there.

**[1:14:53]** Think they're, they're that

**[1:14:54]** sensible to get everything out?

**[1:14:56]** Maybe.

**[1:14:56]** I do.

**[1:14:56]** I think, I think this,

**[1:14:57]** I think the squirrels have taken full ownership

**[1:14:58]** of the basement and everything in it.

**[1:15:00]** They want to take care of it.

**[1:15:02]** All right.

**[1:15:03]** They don't have an insurance policy.

**[1:15:04]** One night at Paul's house

**[1:15:04]** and the world's my oyster.

**[1:15:07]** I creep and crawl in whenever I want to.

**[1:15:11]** Sarah Boyle?

**[1:15:14]** No, that's the scoop.

**[1:15:15]** Susan Boyle, that's the name.

**[1:15:16]** Shit.

**[1:15:16]** Susan Boyle.

**[1:15:20]** One night at Susan Boyle.

**[1:15:22]** I want to thank Mike Jones

**[1:15:23]** for coming on the program.

**[1:15:25]** Absolutely.

**[1:15:25]** I'm going to tell them to subscribe

**[1:15:26]** to his podcast.

**[1:15:27]** Go get his live out.

**[1:15:28]** And it's going to vex if you're around

**[1:15:29]** Vegas Monday night.

**[1:15:31]** I also want to thank all the scoops

**[1:15:32]** who joined us here on, on Twitch.

**[1:15:35]** Yes.

**[1:15:35]** I want to thank all the scoops

**[1:15:36]** who joined us here on Zoom.

**[1:15:38]** That's right.

**[1:15:38]** And it's normal we thank people

**[1:15:40]** in the show.

**[1:15:40]** It's a new month.

**[1:15:41]** We haven't got to thank you

**[1:15:41]** this coordinated yet,

**[1:15:43]** but I want to thank, of course,

**[1:15:44]** everyone who supports us

**[1:15:45]** over on our Patreon.

**[1:15:46]** All the people who find it

**[1:15:48]** in their hearts and in their wallets

**[1:15:49]** to go over to preachingfun.com.

**[1:16:09]** I'm really looking forward to the day

**[1:16:10]** that I don't have to play

**[1:16:11]** that whole theme manually.

**[1:16:13]** I'm actually, I've gotten it all

**[1:16:15]** inked out on a piece of paper

**[1:16:16]** and I'm going to have somebody cut

**[1:16:17]** out all the little holes

**[1:16:18]** in it for a player piano.

**[1:16:20]** But in the meantime,

**[1:16:21]** check out fartsinabag.biz.

**[1:16:31]** That's fartsinabag.biz

**[1:16:33]** that along with preachingfun.com

**[1:16:34]** it takes you over to our Patreon page

**[1:16:36]** where for as little as

**[1:16:37]** three dollars a month

**[1:16:38]** you can upkeep this show on the air.

**[1:16:40]** We are dependent on our Patreon subscribers.

**[1:16:43]** So if you are not a Patreon subscriber

**[1:16:45]** preachingfun.com

**[1:16:47]** fartsinabag.biz

**[1:16:48]** head over there.

**[1:16:49]** If you think this show is worth

**[1:16:50]** more than zero dollars

**[1:16:51]** you can upkeep this show on the air

**[1:16:52]** and we sure do thank you for it.

**[1:16:54]** If you can't do it,

**[1:16:55]** if you can't go over and do

**[1:16:56]** the monetary value thing,

**[1:16:58]** that is okay.

**[1:16:59]** Not everybody is able to do that

**[1:17:00]** these days.

**[1:17:01]** Tell somebody about us.

**[1:17:02]** Tell one person, one person only.

**[1:17:04]** Don't do the two friends

**[1:17:05]** and then they tell two friends

**[1:17:06]** things.

**[1:17:07]** That is a pyramid scheme.

**[1:17:09]** It is unethical.

**[1:17:10]** We don't get into that.

**[1:17:12]** We do an obelisk scheme.

**[1:17:13]** You tell one person, one person only.

**[1:17:15]** It's vertical growth

**[1:17:17]** but you're going to find that one person

**[1:17:18]** that really kind of digs

**[1:17:20]** this weird thing that we're doing over here.

**[1:17:21]** So go let them know about us.

**[1:17:23]** Let them know about the obelisk scheme.

**[1:17:25]** One person and one person only

**[1:17:26]** but that person has to dig this thing

**[1:17:29]** and probably preferably

**[1:17:32]** get on there

**[1:17:33]** and support the Patreon

**[1:17:33]** within the first, I don't know

**[1:17:35]** 10 minutes or so if you're telling them about us.

**[1:17:37]** That'd be really convenient for us.

**[1:17:39]** Don't forget about our billionaire experiment.

**[1:17:43]** Don't forget, get each of us a billion dollars

**[1:17:45]** and we will see if we can be better billionaires

**[1:17:48]** than the current ones.

**[1:17:51]** Oh, shout out to Radio Active Scoop

**[1:17:53]** for doubling their Patreon.

**[1:17:55]** Thank you.

**[1:17:55]** Oh, thank you Radio Active Scoop.
