1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
 We're not privy to the Twitch chat when we switch that off of our stack

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:15,360
 This is my favorite part of the show this is the part of the show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,520
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers up. It's crazy. We have a new list

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,020
 I can't figure out how to look at all of it who can say what's gonna happen in the future

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:34,000
 But hopefully you don't even hear this and you just hear me thanking people in case you don't I decided to put this hilarious

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Anecdote in right here if you want to become an ice cream truck driver

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,600
 And I hope you do preaching fun calm preaching fun commas

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,520
 We're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows the life you save

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,080
 May be your own

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,680
 And now a program hey Johnny

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,400
 Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah? I'd love to great. Let's go

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,920
 We have some guests here in the turn today

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,840
 Mike for sure should be so needed from a list casting the web series

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,520
 It's true

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,560
 Ice cream social sitting in Las Vegas that's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh PA. That's Paul

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,840
 Also in Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun. Oh

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,200
 Yeah, but before we get started fuck land man right in the neck fuck it fuck that show

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
 fuck that

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,360
 Piece of shit

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,480
 So happy that we didn't dive into this season from what I'm hearing about this season

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,520
 This season's been terrible many people been writing about it, but they did a scene

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,360
 Okay, this is second the last scene that the series is about to end and they spend again

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,820
 This is a show about a whole series. Does the end end? No, it should be but no, it won't it will go on

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:05,480
 We're heading to the end of season two, this is a show that is about an oil company

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,240
 aha trapped in doing business with a drug cartel and

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,700
 the episode 9 of a 10 episode season I

27
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,600
 spends

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,780
 90% of it with like really deep

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,760
 Conversations about relationships and about like their daughter going to college and all this other stuff

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,640
 Okay. Now, that's just a big waste of the premise, but

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,760
 In this episode this is things I watch the show because it is mediocre

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,640
 I watch the show because it's easy to watch some of it and go to bed. That's why I watch it, right?

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,640
 so I'm watching it and the daughter goes to college and

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,200
 She it's like this really sweet moment and she even makes like a little like, you know

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,000
 prayer gesture and then opens up her door and walked inside her first dorm room and

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,440
 they have written a character to be a

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,040
 like Charlie Kirk

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,960
 Every liberal valued

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,600
 Person becoming a nightmare possible. It is a trans roommate who says that they are vegan

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,040
 They can't hear certain words because it's triggering. They said they have to meditate they have a pet muskrat. They miss take every possible thing

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,240
 They have to take every possible thing that you could

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,240
 that

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,520
 Every like shitty liberal stereotype. Yes

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,080
 Like here's all and like not even stereo stereotypes the wrong word because it's not even stereotype

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,240
 Because like trans isn't a stereotype, but they just look at that and go like well, well trans is a problem

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,200
 So we're gonna make this into a list of problems

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,600
 See, they took everything that any kind of liberal value and made it an antagonist. Yes

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,140
 I'm trying to make it an assault on the daughter and they literally have the mother come in to save the day where she rents

49
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,600
 A hotel says invite all of your cheerleader friends because the daughter is gonna be on the cheerleading squad

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,020
 They literally sit there sipping margaritas. Okay, everyone's underage except for the mother. They're also

51
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,600
 Margaritas saying this is what college should be like and then talking about the roommate and saying like she's just unhappy with herself

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,200
 So they purposely misgender the roommate and then lecture each other at the pool

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,460
 Saying, you know basically saying that if you have liberal values, you have no fun. You have no friends

54
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,340
 but if you you know, just just

55
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,440
 Hate all those things and just value totally being selfish and fun life works out for you

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,560
 And I'm supposed to go to bed and I'm stead. I'm fucking livid and angry

57
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,320
 That this fucking for no reason just multiple shots anti-trans

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,520
 Multiple shots across the bow just hitting transfer. No reason not for no reason

59
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,480
 Fair fair

60
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,220
 There there's a reason there are several psyops going on right now, baby

61
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,120
 But this is it like I get it like we watch entertainment to give ourselves

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,360
 brief respite from this hellscape of issues that we were constantly assaulted with from the time we wake up to the time we go

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,040
 To bed, right and on the one hand we shouldn't be so concerned with the news

64
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,080
 On the other hand real terrible shit is happening and it is affecting people. So where do we find a balance?

65
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,120
 I don't know but one place to try to find balance is like for an hour before I go to bed

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,740
 Right, like can I make a recommendation as to my bedroom viewing routine?

67
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,520
 Just just your own penis where you put googly eyes on it and you just well that step one is

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,640
 because

69
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,600
 Bobo, that's his name Bobo is always watching along

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,280
 Well, he can't watch without it. You can't watch without his eyes put on the uniform

71
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,040
 You got to put the googly eyes on or Bobo is blind and a blind Bobo. Nobody wants to see that

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,200
 anyway, I strapped Bobo's eyes on and I throw on tubi and

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,840
 tubi has the giant selection of

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,760
 Mystery science theater and rift tracks and that's all I do

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,000
 I start a mystery science theater or rift tracks and let it play in the background forever. It's a mediocre film

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,360
 If it has anything problematic in it, it is being lampooned by voices of reason who happened to be based out of Minnesota, by the way

77
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,160
 Mystery science theater mystery science theater was from Minnesota. That's where that that all jumped off

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,000
 that brilliant stuff so

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:33,680
 That's how I soothed myself to sleep every night by watching old episodes of mystery science theater and rift tracks that I have seen

80
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
 Hundreds of times and it's wonderful. Yeah

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,680
 I will anything's better than what I'm doing. So I can't I can't say whether I do or don't like your idea Paul

82
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,920
 I'm not a good judge of character as to how to spend an evening

83
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,340
 So the best part about it Matt is that it especially with the rift tracks

84
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,360
 Yeah, you've got the voices of the guys who are very left-leaning

85
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,500
 For the most part Mike's not but still he wrote

86
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,600
 you know, like I I used to just watch mediocre dramas because

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,920
 Comedy makes me can get me in my analytical brain, which makes it not shut off

88
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,940
 And so I end up like in a in a like joke construction

89
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,200
 Kind of whatever and I can just I can just stay up for for hours and hours and hours and hours gotcha

90
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,840
 So that's usually why I try to watch thing about rift tracks is because what you're watching is not funny, but they make it silly

91
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,680
 Yeah, and so I take what I can watch I can watch

92
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:41,040
 Man hands down. I haven't even watched season two. It's already better. This is who's definitely better than the season two of land man

93
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 I've ever even watched definitely

94
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,800
 Is it out yet? Are you just about to roll out episodes? Where are we at from from the sake of a viewer boys?

95
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,220
 We have five episodes out. So we have only three more so you have some catching up to do. Mr

96
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,800
 Donnelly deal deal clearly my schedule is now open. So there you go. No problem

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 Your viewing schedule has opened up. So remind our audience about what your show is and where people watch it

98
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,120
 Absolutely, we are a list casting

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,280
 Jimmy are my esteemed actor here who keeps randomly changing his wallpaper and

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,080
 Currently has a massage table

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:33,340
 That's exciting who's never mind, I'm not even gonna ask who I've been in that spot that's happy beginnings. I know that place

102
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:40,080
 Casting season two is located

103
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,360
 Happy beginnings at the beginning. I mean not that I'm overly familiar with the industry

104
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
 but I'm guessing that would work actually better right like I

105
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,520
 Think it's way more comfortable than a casting couch. Let's just go with that

106
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,120
 Let's get that crazy part out of the way and then now I can really relax into a mess

107
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,320
 Okay, but I'm just gonna say you're missing the market

108
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:24,800
 It's actually about a show about two casting directors and their assistant who have been blackballed by Hollywood and

109
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,880
 now they are stuck in Las Vegas because when

110
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,800
 Hollywood spits you out

111
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,880
 Vegas sucks you in

112
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,720
 That's true, I mean you guys are writing season three

113
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:56,840
 Jimmy plays Roger and Roger is the owner of happy beginnings and no Roger Roger

114
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 Jimmy started out in

115
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,240
 as sad actor and in the pilot episode and

116
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,680
 we loved him so so much in the pilot episode that we gave him a name and

117
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,240
 He's been a series and he's you got Urkel buddy. You got Urkel look at you go

118
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:29,760
 Yes, it's it's a it's a very proud day, you know, I'm a classically trained actor I studied Shakespeare Chekhov

119
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,180
 Decorated with awards and now here I am dressing up as a clown

120
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,800
 and

121
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 Playing these sad actor

122
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,480
 Before I actually get actually get my name. So finally got my name and it's Roger. Oh

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:53,320
 Is there any Rogers do we do we do you know any like actual Rogers in the wild these I know a Roger

124
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,600
 I mean, there's the American dad alien

125
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
 And and that's the other one that I could think of yeah

126
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,880
 And the American dad alien guy Jimmy I am stunned by this question

127
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,640
 I have to actually look at my contacts with Roger Moore Roger in my okay. No Roger Whitaker Roger Whitaker

128
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,920
 American treasure actually, I think he's English English treasure Roger Whitaker. Do I know Roger?

129
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,240
 Yeah, the only one that popped up in my phone is the one that I mentioned

130
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,680
 He is the only Roger that I that I have in my content

131
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,900
 I do squirrely as Jimmy just asked the same question over and over again while you guys continue to stretch the parameters of the question

132
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,520
 Roger Stone, I do not have in my Rolodex

133
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,760
 Do you get a Roger ring at the massage parlor Roger Dodger

134
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,920
 Happy Roger. I dodger on my Todd. Don't have anyone with a first name Roger in my contacts. Yeah

135
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,240
 Let me shout out Roger. That's it. I'm gonna make another kid. I'm gonna name him Roger the market's wide open. I

136
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:07,320
 Do want to say that his name almost was Kroger because when we were writing it I mistyped

137
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,040
 Roger and

138
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 my creative partner Zack

139
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,260
 Loved that it was Kroger and he was like, I love it. His name is gonna be Kroger

140
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 I can make Kroger work. Well Kroger is not only the grocery chain, but you've also got

141
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,320
 the Nickelback fame Kroger, right like that's

142
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,440
 Jack Kroger is Nickelback, right?

143
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,160
 Hence why I had to cut it back to run. I guess have three Kroger nowadays. He's known as

144
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,080
 Mrs. Avril Lavigne, right? Yeah

145
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,800
 Okay, I wish I was for that weird marriage

146
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,420
 Yeah Avril Lavigne Mary nickelback, did you guys not know that

147
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:10,120
 Yeah, I thought Avril Lavigne died didn't she die well like one of her guys

148
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,660
 One of the Levine's died, but there's lots of clones of her

149
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:21,560
 Okay. No, she didn't die. She got Lyme disease, right? Isn't isn't she the one that got that guy? No, that's that's somebody else

150
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,840
 That's what's her name from bikini kill who's married to a Beastie Boy?

151
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,720
 I'm with Jimmy on this one. I think

152
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,440
 She might have put

153
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,580
 Kathleen Hanna also got Lyme's disease

154
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,640
 Good Kathleen Hanna though. So what I'm the initial riot girl

155
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,640
 Yeah, what I'm taking from this is if you marry a musician you get some kind of disease

156
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,480
 Avril Lavigne contracted Lyme disease from a tick bite in 2014

157
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,000
 Oh, no

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,360
 Yeah, Jimmy knows everything about Lyme disease. Gotta stop this camera. Everything about Avril Lavigne except for her nickelback husband

159
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,400
 Kroger who's apparently named Iraq air who else got Lyme disease?

160
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,080
 Anybody who goes outdoors, which is why I never do it the outdoors. Yes, like

161
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,820
 That was really like something that was like kind of like brought to me as like a selling point of just like yeah

162
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,940
 We go out for a walk. We go through the trees. We petted a deer and then we go home and check each other for ticks

163
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,920
 I'm like, I don't want type 2 entertainment. I don't want it

164
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,760
 This entertainment pitch this is a terrible salesperson

165
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,840
 Yes, you're right terrible

166
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,760
 Now Jimmy once your character went from sad actor to Roger

167
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,240
 Did you start doing a lot of like hmm? I don't know if my character would say it this way or my character do that

168
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,520
 Roger doesn't kind of person who would like did you really take ownership now of your scenes, right? Right?

169
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,320
 Yeah, no, I I had plenty of notes. Well, I didn't have them. I didn't give the notes my agent gave

170
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,340
 Directly, I mean I don't got time for that shit

171
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:15,160
 Thank you again for being here by the way, oh sure it's my pleasure I'm the envelope is slip slipping through the door

172
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,440
 It's on its way we're paying him Michaels to be paying

173
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,840
 Pay them in sandwiches

174
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,540
 As long as the money in the sun is green. Oh

175
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,040
 This is gonna be this is gonna be so awkward. I have them slipping a sandwich under your door right now

176
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:47,300
 It is a capriotti sandwich like it's a it's a big it's not gonna fit under the door it's gonna be a mess

177
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
 So Michael I know

178
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,240
 Now I'm hungry

179
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:10,840
 You guys have a studio where you're filming a lot of this but are we looking as you keep growing here to do more on

180
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,280
 site possible shoots and things like that to make Vegas even more of a character as

181
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,040
 The series progresses as I know LA is quite the character in a lot of Los Angeles productions

182
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,960
 So are we hoping to make that more of a reality?

183
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:34,160
 I know there were talks at one time of Las Vegas investing in some tax breaks for filming and stuff like that

184
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
 That may have just been pissed in the wind

185
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,920
 Yeah, I don't think that's really come to fruition

186
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,240
 But what's the what's the ability to how how film friendly is Vegas right now for what you're doing?

187
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,720
 Um, actually I found filming in Vegas like really

188
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,280
 Embracing like it's actually a lot easier to get permits

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,440
 It's a lot easier to okay find locations for people to film that the problem is

190
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,560
 a cost a lot of money to transport an entire crew and to rehearse in a space and all that so

191
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,920
 Yeah, as soon as a list casting gets funding from a bigger network

192
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,600
 we'll definitely be able to okay take advantage of all these things, but

193
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:26,760
 currently we tend to pick one location outside of our casting office to go to and and this time

194
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,440
 It was a local dance studio where we filmed that but in the previous season

195
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,960
 We went to Millennium Fandom Bar, which I'm sure you guys are familiar with. Yes one bar got to film there and

196
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,040
 yeah, so I

197
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,240
 Think that if we could afford it, I would absolutely do but you know

198
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,600
 This is definitely an independent project where we pay Jimmy and massages and sandwiches

199
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,920
 Yeah, so if any locations wanting want to let us film there for sandwiches and massages then

200
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:06,120
 Example that's a great example of local business chipping in and wanting to be represented on the on the screen

201
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,160
 So an example of businesses that love massages and sandwiches

202
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,640
 Jacob what was that bar that you went to that turned into two bars last the other night? Maybe those guys need some

203
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,160
 Film broadcast. They look like they need some promotion, right? Tony two bars. Don't need to buy Tony to bar

204
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,740
 Was that it wasn't right? No, the guy dragged you over to a second bar for a drink and then left you high and dry

205
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,160
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, the owner of this bar like took us out of his bar to a different bar and

206
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,720
 Seemed like he was gonna buy us a drink and hang out with us in this other bar that he was taking us to and then just

207
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
 left

208
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,940
 He was like he was in the other bar for a grand total of two minutes

209
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,860
 Well, you don't want to mention either of these bars, it was the weirdest thing I've forgotten both of the names

210
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,800
 That's one thing. Well, then they definitely need some promotion. So the second one used to be the downtown lounge

211
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,920
 That was that it was it was the same word twice. It was a nice place, too

212
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,920
 Was it boing-boing or something like that? No, it wasn't boing-boing. We're calling it. Hatsy-tatsy. So it rhymes with that

213
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,420
 Yeah, all right, hoochie smooth. It was like it was like Potsy Potsy

214
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:21,300
 Potsy pot. It was Potsy Pots with the other one was Potsy Potsy. Good. We figured out guys. Go ahead and film there

215
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,880
 Yeah

216
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:31,400
 As far as we're concerned, well at least I'm glad to hear that at least on the locals level Vegas is still

217
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,000
 Helping each other out in that respect

218
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,200
 statistically I

219
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,520
 Also, I feel like he is I also volunteer at Jacob's house. Oh

220
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:49,160
 Yeah, yeah, how's your house is it good for does have a casting couch and sandwiches and so many

221
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,560
 So many cast the couches so many sandwiches

222
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,200
 You'd be you'd be doing me a favor if you got rid of some of these sandwiches actually

223
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,800
 He actually has like a dog accessible casting couch, which is pretty amazing

224
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:07,000
 He's got a little puffy stair staircase that goes up to his couch for his puppies, so that's it's a good it's good for

225
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,700
 For dogs almost sleep their way into roles

226
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,280
 Right. Oh, I see. Mm-hmm. I wasn't sure that was for me to get on to the

227
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,800
 Very high couch

228
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,640
 Person but no seriously that you know

229
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,280
 It's it's I think it is a love letter to Las Vegas not so much in terms of the landmarks or the the the

230
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,080
 places but like the characters that you'll find yeah in Las Vegas which I mean

231
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,220
 I challenge you to find something that has that sort of thing where it like kind of explores the strange

232
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,680
 Weird people who are in the entertainment field on the fringes that are not circa or Spiegel or whatever and

233
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,120
 and how they

234
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,280
 Make their lives work in this town because you know like LA actors left and right but you know, what are these?

235
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
 lowly

236
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,480
 Sad lawyer turned actors and you know all these all these other kind of characters

237
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,120
 So I think that's it's that's one of the benefits of it

238
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
 I mean, no no city on earth has better people watching than Las Vegas

239
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,520
 and so to have a show that is kind of dedicated to a

240
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:27,320
 Bit of that spirit is is a fascinating idea and something that people should check out

241
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,040
 I mean that that's a that is a weirdly niche thing that I think people are gonna really love

242
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,880
 and

243
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,360
 More importantly Jimmy in episode 3 is dressed up as a birthday party clown trying to steal craft

244
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,780
 crafty, which is the catering at

245
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,920
 services and and

246
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,880
 Him and I get in a shouting match with each other. So whoa

247
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 Is that because Jimmy?

248
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,280
 Is that because Jimmy came to the shooting from his side gig as a birthday clown? No, no, no, no

249
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:08,600
 he is for so the backstory of the movie that we're filming is that he's the clown in a world of mimes and

250
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:17,120
 He feels lonely and left out and so he has to it's very dramatic has to jump off the roof to end everything

251
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,120
 I can't wait to watch this. This is all backstory. This is all backstory that you will not know. Of course, you're hearing it first

252
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 Jimmy knew this

253
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,400
 I

254
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:37,080
 Was wondering why there were all these minds and me there that that was kind of confusing but now that makes no makes total sense

255
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,280
 Now you finish season 1

256
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:49,080
 Just does suddenly like did you always you're gonna make the season 2 season 2 simply just like I we can't something of funny casting

257
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,800
 Adventures to go on or did you think of somewhere new to go with the show?

258
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,520
 How did it all come together creatively for season 2?

259
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,520
 Well, our writer Nick Adams he had already started writing

260
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:10,600
 Season 2 unbeknownst to us. So we're like we did season 1 and our executive producer Chuck Prater was like, you know

261
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,360
 I I think that we need to get a season 2 going away

262
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,300
 I'm gonna get some funding for you guys and stuff and then Nick was like funny enough. I have

263
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,580
 eight episodes ready for you guys to go and I was like

264
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,760
 That's great. I was like

265
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,560
 okay, and I was like this is great now we need to make them twice as long and

266
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,920
 with much more characters and much to my chagrin doing

267
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,600
 27 pages a day I was in three days

268
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,940
 We talked about this last time I was on but yeah, we tend to shoot three episodes per day it and that was

269
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,080
 It turned out wonderful. But also I was like, I'm never doing this again, which I say after every season

270
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:02,120
 I was gonna ask you when he when the when the writers said, oh, I've got eight more episodes in the in the bag

271
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,880
 Ready to go. Were you more excited or more terrified? Which which direction did the needle lean?

272
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,720
 Because I know at least I know both both were on the scale for sure

273
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,960
 We were very excited actually because

274
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,480
 You know, we love doing this. This is you know at Jimmy having this whole family together having everybody on the set

275
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
 It's it's definitely been an experience. We've been doing it for five years

276
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,420
 So bringing the crew together and and doing everything it feels like at the end of 16 hours

277
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,240
 Like everybody's just like oh my gosh

278
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:42,320
 But then you get to see what you did and what you achieved and that's that in itself is always always gratifying and

279
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,240
 Actually, Matt and I had a conversation about magicians

280
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,360
 You said you never do you said you never out me on this you said you're gonna give us anonymous

281
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,280
 You're supposed to say a magician friend I

282
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,840
 Know well

283
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,360
 We I told it to the writer and so now it's too late. So if there is a season three

284
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,780
 There's gonna be a magician episode. So hopefully we can get some

285
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,800
 magician

286
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,780
 Adjacent type people maybe Matt Donnelly will make an appearance. I can't tell whether you're saying I should do this or stay away from it

287
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,560
 I'll do it. I would love to do it. Yeah. Oh my god, if you can see on the background, there's

288
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,840
 There's Jimmy's clown spoilers, but that's me. Oh, yeah Wow

289
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,080
 Pretty dope for the video for people who aren't on on twitch or zoom. Yeah, there's a little little bonus something

290
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,060
 I'll let you know. I'll just speak as my agent for a moment. You should make Matt part of the last episode because he tends to

291
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,880
 Cause schedules to go off the rails with

292
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,400
 You definitely want you don't want me holding up another episode. I'll just tell you that much right now

293
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,820
 You oh, you'll be the grand finale, baby. There you go. There you go

294
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,080
 I'll get you we give you your least amount of patience and I'm doing the most amount of improv. You're gonna love it

295
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,240
 Why the show ended

296
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
 Oh

297
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:16,400
 Yeah, I had a friend working on a project that I was like

298
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,720
 Oh, I would have been fun to work on that one and then they described the working process is like

299
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,840
 Oh, I would have been a nightmare. Thank God. I didn't try to be a part of that project. I just pissed everyone off

300
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,360
 They would have hated me but it's good

301
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,880
 Somebody just put Jimmy with the dude wipes dressed as a clown

302
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,080
 Dude wipes, I'll have you know, that's Blumpkin spice. That is not Photoshopped. That is legit. That is

303
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,600
 I didn't have that picture

304
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,880
 Yeah, Jimmy Wow, Jimmy

305
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,600
 That's good lighting. Look at that

306
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,800
 That's download that shit. Yeah, that's a good picture

307
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,560
 Jimmy how many that's going how many months now with no podcast? Do you miss it at all?

308
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
 Do you hate not being part of the audio world?

309
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,320
 No, see now like this is the perfect opportunity for season 3 the all a list casting goes all podcast

310
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,720
 Just goes to totally man Michael only Michael I'm gonna tell you right now you're gonna love the format change

311
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:26,960
 You know what if it's not 16 hour days and we're doing three back-to-back podcasts, I'm here for it's way shorter days

312
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:34,880
 We only do two on on our hardest days. We do two in a row. We've we've tried three in the past and it doesn't work

313
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
 If I ever they don't even go on location anymore. No, they just do it all from home

314
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,000
 Ship or wherever the hell they are

315
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,440
 That's like take bruises, what can I say we've evolved

316
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,080
 No, I'm good. I'm I'm good

317
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,240
 saving my

318
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,740
 conversations for my therapist good and not for not for

319
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,940
 Some two dudes that I that I work with that I love

320
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:07,440
 Yeah, you guys are getting together for the occasional meal. He's still keeping up with the guys. It's just not as regular or

321
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,080
 Yeah, yeah, sure. You know, it's you know, and you know, we got the dressing room has to say you see each other all the time

322
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,920
 Wouldn't it be great here? If it was like actually we have built walls between our stations and the dressing rooms

323
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:25,600
 Literally not spoken since that last episode like you know when like restaurants were desperate to open during kovat

324
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,960
 So they put up all those little micro walls and stuff

325
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,600
 Yeah, so the dresser was like now atmosphere and the best part is all you need for Jimmy to stay private is a micro wall

326
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:48,540
 Get the part buddy you want to massage you want to get on the massage table you gotta

327
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
 Ah

328
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,120
 Now I so the last time I was on this episode all we could talk about was docking

329
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,740
 so I was like I'm gonna bring Jimmy on so at least like he'll keep these guys in line and

330
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,960
 Good job, Jimmy. Good job, Jimmy

331
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,440
 Actually, I'm glad you brought up docking because I have some things I want to discuss with that

332
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,280
 So, thank you

333
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,280
 Jimmy maybe maybe this is unfair to put a button on it, but we should say

334
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
 You since you last were on air

335
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,800
 Your case got thrown out you weren't you were not being it did you were not exonerated?

336
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:38,000
 You're not being good. I go into jail for going to your own place of business from a bar

337
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,840
 Yes, it has been dropped but it still could be I guess I just found this out the other day

338
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,960
 It could be it takes a year for them to like actually close it

339
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,720
 So like at any point if I act up or you know

340
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,080
 Oh Jesus still like yeah, so you're

341
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:04,320
 List is that what we're hearing still kind of tell me that Las Vegas has like a delete folder for 365

342
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,680
 So like if you move into delete, but it actually stays in this folder for a year

343
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:17,920
 Exactly so I still get to mind my P's and Q's no happy endings at the massage

344
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,000
 Got to the beginnings are on the table beginnings. Oh, we have to be happy. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely

345
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,040
 but yes for all intents and purposes that

346
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,680
 that that case is now now done and

347
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:38,680
 The future is still is unclear and my lawyer says I shouldn't talk too much about it. There we go. That's fine

348
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,820
 We'll leave it. We'll leave it

349
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,840
 Let's leave it there. Yeah. Yeah, I was want to celebrate

350
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,000
 I mean, I've not put it like a little no my calendar like wait a year to celebrate. Yeah

351
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,940
 Good to know 11th the fateful day June 11th

352
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:01,080
 Well, I have I have faith in the fair and 611 you turned around it's 9/11. Oh my 9/11 Wow

353
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,200
 Illuminati never forget guys Machiavelli

354
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,320
 You know when we started this episode today, I thought to myself, you know

355
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,180
 I really hope I could find out one day what Jimmy Sloaneen is 9/11

356
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:23,320
 Jimmy's personal 11. It's just actually now gonna be an icebreaker for all of our guests. Hey, yeah, what's your 9/11?

357
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,740
 My 9/11 is finding out my character's named Roger

358
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,000
 When it could be Kroger the whole time

359
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,480
 He looks so much like a Kroger

360
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:42,320
 My 9/11 is watching episode 9 of of land man over and over again

361
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 There's a character in a list

362
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,160
 God help us her name

363
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:55,840
 The actress name is Katie and we we turned her. Yeah, she's hilarious

364
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,680
 you'll see her in episode 5 and she says so in episode 3, but she's featured in episode 5 and

365
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,760
 Unfortunately, we made it a bit that her name is tall actress

366
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,960
 So that's what she's called in the show and she doesn't get a name. No one can remember her name

367
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
 It's just sort of nice

368
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,760
 So she hasn't been given a name and she is very careful to remind us every time we do any kind of promotion

369
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:30,320
 That she doesn't have a name yet. And I'm like, don't worry. It's gonna be a big reveal in season 3 Kroger or 5

370
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:38,020
 So her real name is tall actress

371
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,680
 Her name is also Roger. Yeah

372
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,800
 It's also Roger

373
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,280
 Everybody is Roger. This is all on YouTube. Yes

374
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,040
 Yep, you can find it all on YouTube. I

375
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:01,520
 Think you just look up a list casting and you will see me you will see Jimmy

376
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,880
 you'll see a lot of Las Vegas actors and

377
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,720
 Jonas Wilberton. Oh, wow. There's so many people you guys know who's who of scoop guests. Yes

378
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,520
 Tons of them. Yes, Karina Harney Jones. Yes

379
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:24,020
 Nicole Unger, I heard there's a lot of pressure to up the sex appeal for season 2 to boost the ratings. Is that true?

380
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,000
 That's very true

381
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,280
 Jimmy

382
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,600
 shows his nipples on every podcast and

383
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
 Whether he's asked to or not

384
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,760
 yeah, and

385
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,040
 much much like

386
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,320
 Brett Alters he gets naked at the top chance. You know, you don't have to ask Brett once

387
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,520
 I've got one more testicle in that guy

388
00:33:51,520 --> 00:34:01,120
 Somewhere Brett Alters is just getting like things in the universe

389
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 He's got a little baby

390
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,440
 One is enough the ringmaster of Big Apple Circus. Now he's touring with Piff again. Fuck that guy

391
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,720
 Yeah, but fuck you Brett Alters. You'll never be on a list cast and your nudity

392
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,320
 But we'd love to have you back on on the podcast. Oh, yeah, come on by Brett any time. Yeah

393
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,800
 I don't think we ever had bread on which is a mistake. No, did we have it once?

394
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,200
 Maybe a long time ago. Oh, yeah, we've done this podcast. I don't know. He'd have to tell us

395
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
 He'd have to tell us

396
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,600
 Now we knew this podcast and Piff stuff. Yeah, I have no idea you guys talk about how if you you know

397
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,960
 You had a budget you go maybe shoot some more locations and that kind of stuff

398
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,320
 Modern entertainment is a fucking crazy

399
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,860
 Making entertainment was always hard. It's harder than ever to take the independent project like this to a major

400
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,400
 Streamer but but small entertainment like this like these smaller episodes and being able to watch from your phones that kind of stuff

401
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
 Like that's all on the rise, right?

402
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,860
 Yeah has have you thought about possibly simply trying to do like a Kickstarter or a crowd funder to try to maybe see if you

403
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,320
 Could just get a budget you'd want for to maybe make this a little a little more dynamic and spicy for you guys

404
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:28,360
 Yeah, I mean that's definitely on the portfolio, you know, we're looking at where things go

405
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,640
 With this current season and then we're gonna get together and talk about okay

406
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,240
 Do we crowdfunds like what's our goals? Like what are we gonna do with season 3?

407
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,880
 What can we do to make a season 3 happen, you know that sort of thing or

408
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,240
 You know with the help of all the scoops in the chat and everything

409
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,480
 They're the subscriber base and the viewers watch and everything goes up so high that we can

410
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,240
 You know take that to more of a network type style

411
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,920
 So there's two different ways to go we kind of have to step back and examine exactly where we're at

412
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,320
 I would love like, you know, this this show is is

413
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,840
 Definitely a love letter to Las Vegas and and to the entertainment here

414
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,080
 So I would love to continue making it and everybody enjoys

415
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:17,400
 The process of doing it. So there's many there's many opportunities where we're gonna be looking at

416
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,240
 But hopefully one of them would be to crowdfund and to kind of get it enough of a budget to make a season 3

417
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
 The other option, you know

418
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,960
 take it to some more networks again now that we have more of a fan base and stuff and

419
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,520
 Show them the analytics and that kind of thing and see if it gets picked up. So all right

420
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,160
 Well, do you crowdfund Paul Jacob and I are in for five dollars?

421
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,800
 Yes

422
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,000
 Between the two of you

423
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,920
 Switches your background to Jimmy and Jimmy's background, which is pretty good

424
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,080
 It's a Russian nesting doll

425
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:12,840
 This is what I put the link I put the link to the a list casting channel on the chat

 First of all, I'm gonna let y'all know I got to experience a little slice of heaven the other night

461
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,320
 Let me tell you what a slice of heaven is

462
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,680
 So I went to this massage part a slice of heaven. Happy beginnings

463
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,400
 Happy beginnings is a Pennsylvania CoC Costco

464
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,480
 On a on a Steelers playoff Monday night. Oh man

465
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
 Ghost town

466
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,820
 Was wonderful and and I had the run of the place there couldn't have been 50 people there workers included

467
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,320
 It was wonderful

468
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,440
 Were the workers all furious that they were there? No, nobody in their right mind wanted to watch that game. Give me a break

469
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,400
 Are you kidding me?

470
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,160
 Anyway, I watched a few minutes of it and then just dozed off

471
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,800
 Up at some point right around it was almost halftime. I mean it was right after halftime and

472
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,000
 Looked at the game. It went. Nope. It turned it off and got up. I just did other things. Yeah. Yeah

473
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,280
 Yeah, as someone who loves watching Aaron Rodgers lose and be a dick about it. It was a fucking chef's kiss

474
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,340
 More perfect than an interception turned touchdown as you're fine

475
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,680
 Everyone else out on the sideline and they just showed up shouting at everyone. Yeah, I was like, ah

476
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,020
 Well, he's the reason I didn't watch a single lick of it this whole season and I'm a better person for it

477
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
 And now I'm completely off

478
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,760
 That and you don't care about sports. I don't I really don't

479
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,020
 Forgot that you don't care about sports. I reminded myself real quick Rogers

480
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,980
 Just reminded you if anything you owe Aaron Rodgers. Well part of it too was for two years. I was basically

481
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,560
 Immobile from my damn leg. So I that's true

482
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,080
 I didn't have a whole lot of options but to connect with the outside world through live sports entertainment

483
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,320
 It was either like sports or become a card magician. That was kind of it. And so I think I chose wisely again

484
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:21,000
 Alright, so that was a great that our scoops right now are all catching each other up on football and they also don't care

485
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,500
 I know that much about it. So right now the chat is just a litany of like wait bears wait

486
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
 Somebody just mentioned the Brooklyn Dodgers

487
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,240
 Yeah

488
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,660
 So anyway, that was great fun Monday night going shopping with Ann. That's really funny to hit

489
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:51,680
 Truly the perfect time it was the perfect time it was insane like I mean ghost town so there was that and then

490
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,480
 and for holiday through her work got a

491
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,880
 gift card from one of her associates for

492
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,400
 Applebee's so we decided to burn that Applebee's gift card yesterday. I

493
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,360
 Don't know if you guys have been to Applebee's Applebee's. We had to use it at Applebee's. Well, you shouldn't have burned it

494
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:18,220
 Well, we that was you know, we probably it might have been a better move. I don't know but we went to Applebee's

495
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:24,720
 Applebee's currently has on the menu on the menu currently. They have an item called the

496
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,440
 om-cheeseburger

497
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,440
 Om-oh, this is the one just yes. I just saw the ads for this, too

498
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,160
 This was on every playoff game this weekend. So they cut a cheeseburger in half and let it rest on them

499
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,840
 melted dish of cheese

500
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,660
 Not just a melted dish of cheese. The wording is served in a molten pool of cheese

501
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,160
 Sir in a molten pool of cheese

502
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,880
 This is what Matt and Matty Lee's ice cream socials served in a molten pool of cheese. I was like, yeah

503
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,720
 I'm gonna have to move. I'm gonna have to move throsian to second place as to what to do with my dead body

504
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,960
 Put me in a ball pool of cheese

505
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,880
 Why wait till you're dead though serve me

506
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,760
 Fondue

507
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,160
 Do you put like a long fork oh

508
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,320
 You have to get a fork in there to get the cheese that's left and I'll tell you this

509
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,480
 Oh Applebee's missing out on giving people a long fork for their hamburger to dip it in the cheese

510
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,360
 I didn't eat super fast like on the time. I went for the second the second half

511
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,080
 You're too late bozo you missed your train

512
00:44:52,080 --> 00:45:00,780
 Half my burgers on the plate and I saw I saw on the menu I was like limited time only I'm like

513
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,820
 Yeah, you have a limited time to eat it before it glues itself to the dinner where there it is

514
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:14,760
 And then put the two flat halves down in just a plate of cheese, that's it

515
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,240
 Video up there this feels like something that like some mother does for like one of her kids

516
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,160
 And like right you serve it to me with the cheese on the plate. Can you can I have melty cheeseburger tonight? Yeah

517
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,240
 Melty pool burger and then that kid goes to sleep over the first time and he asked me to cut his cheeseburger in half

518
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,520
 Is this you put more cheese on the plate you guys do melty pool burgers?

519
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:45,040
 They go. What the hell are you talking about kid and then he shows it and they never eat a cheeseburger the same way again

520
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,640
 And then those children went on to open an Applebee

521
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,640
 Well, like I say, I'll say it wasn't bad. It's just that that second time experience

522
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,320
 It should come. Yeah, it should come like fondue should have a little little fire. Let's have a little heater

523
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:04,560
 Yeah, it it comes on a skillet. So it comes out bubbling like a fajita plate

524
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,480
 so it is truly like

525
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,020
 Like it is molten cheese like you cannot

526
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:22,560
 I dare you to consume me is the cheese just is the is the cheese in the in the little pan just like cheese

527
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,860
 Just like cheddar cheese or something. It's a it's like a

528
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,240
 Mexican cheese blend I would say like a matcha jack style

529
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,240
 This is a fucking this is a fucking miss on their part not to do it in a pan of queso. Yeah whiz

530
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,680
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, if you're if you're going for it, you should go for it

531
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,840
 Like they do serve like kill it just do some skillet. Okay, so there you're done

532
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,520
 I think they serve skillet queso at Applebee's. Come on Applebee's. I'm giving you gems here

533
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,680
 you know, I went to Sonic the other night and I

534
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,000
 You know, they have a pretzel twist like a cheese dip, but they're at a pretzel twist. So I still order the the the the

535
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,640
 dip

536
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,080
 Yeah, I ordered the dip and put my tater tots in it tater tots. Oh

537
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,520
 Smart each Applebee's each shit Applebee's well, I think I think they're on to something

538
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,360
 But I think you guys are exactly right if you're gonna go for it fucking go for it

539
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,760
 but then I think it becomes just a you're spending too much on your cheese and

540
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,640
 So I think it just becomes an arms race at that point

541
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,560
 I think then all the restaurants are racing to see who can put what in queso

542
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,880
 Yeah, and I mean it would probably just end the world

543
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,240
 I I mean if if you so if you put on your menu menu in queso emergency

544
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
 burger I

545
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:48,620
 Am I am buying that sandwich? I will be at your restaurant every day every day in queso emergency eat cheeseburger

546
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:54,600
 Fuck yeah, and go ahead like make that just an option in case of emergency as an option

547
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,840
 So I order a chicken Caesar wrap cut it in half dip the two hands into a bone thing of cheese and give it to me

548
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,620

 The guy front and center looks awfully familiar

699
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:45,160
 But I think the last time we saw him he'd just had his hair and everything else frosted

700
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,880
 What's the movie beautiful moment is the shining?

 and he says I'm off stage and for no reason the the show gets really crazy and

704
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,320
 Dion was so proud of it. Just cuts to a photo of an old

705
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:16,440
 Ballroom and Dion's character is in it singing in this old shot

 And he said it's from The Shining and I go buddy. You don't even know

01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:04,400
 This is a number one

716
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:13,520
 Paint it black. I don't say it's a number one. Paint it black's not on my guess. Yeah, I was thinking about that

738
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,000

01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:59,280
 ASMR kind of way all these different very exotic candies. Oh, man

819
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:10,520
 I got a Canadian girlfriend. Yeah, and it's like it's like a silly-looking picture. Yeah. Yeah

820
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:19,440
 Matt closing out the category in the game photos in movies Matt trying to hold on to third place for $400. Let's go a

821
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:27,320
 Photo of three siblings where two of them seem to seem to fade out of existence. That's heavy. What's the movie?

822
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:32,260
 Also weight has nothing to do with it Baron von Munchausen

823
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,280
 My proxy to out of existence

824
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:43,280
 What is the come on you know this I do? Yeah. Oh, yeah, everybody knows this

825
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,200
 This is the reason that for like two years

826
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:53,560
 I wore a Mickey Mouse shirt if you don't get this right because this this photograph in this movie if you don't get this right

827
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,560
 I'm gonna call you a Huey loser

828
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,520
 Wow

829
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,520
 hip to be square in

830
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,520
 In high definition, okay, that's it

831
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:10,520
 Matt if you don't get this I am gonna go outside. I'm gonna get into my lifted Toyota pickup truck

832
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,480
 I'm gonna drive over there, and I'm gonna take you on a camping trip

833
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:20,360
 With Elizabeth shoe

834
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:26,800
 She's gonna be there Harry and the Hendersons no adventures in babysitting

835
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,840
 Matt you're gonna feel silly in the future when you don't get this fine. Let's just let's just make that the present

836
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:43,480
 Paul it's back to the future back to the future. Oh right right right right right I

837
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:50,400
 I did not love those movies when they came out and my

838
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,600
 Did and then I was always on it like parties and sleepovers and stuff

839
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,480
 But I was always half paying attention to those things as a seminal movie for me

840
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,760
 A lot of people know it's an age thing

841
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:09,960
 Yeah, I'm a little older than you I forget sometimes and those early years are big right like that was a big movie in the theater for me

842
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:17,080
 When that was it was big for me because back to the future 2 came out at I was whatever whatever age

843
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,480
 I was when back to the future 2 came out

844
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:23,120
 I was the perfect age for that and so that got me hooked like back on back to the future 1 and yeah

845
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
 And yeah, then I was back in

846
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,000
 That's the game by the way Paul crushed us what?

847
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:34,480
 2200 points I have 1600 points at least I'm respectable because Matt only has negative 400

848
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,160
 But if I've gotten that share question, right, I would have only gotten the third

849
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,760
 That's right. So you got that right?

850
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,360
 Was it Chris Angel has a chimera that was actually a very well-written

851
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:52,360
 Trivia that was great. I love I love that's good. Even though I got because I won over by it. It was really good

852
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:58,560

856
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,200
 I

857
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:16,720
 Definitely thought I was gonna have name lists by now by this point the episode to thank people and I don't

858
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,920
 Well, we're gonna think a lot of people are really working on it

859
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,360
 Are we gonna add it in or do you think we're just gonna go one more episode?

860
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:28,000
 Because this one comes out tomorrow. I think we're gonna go one more episode great

861
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,960
 Well, let's know the time we thank all the people support us on patreon

862
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,280
 Obviously, we're in a transition of going from any to no one

863
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,600
 Other people a lot of people have offered to hop in there. Yes, we're still getting our

864
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,240
 We did and we may still take them up on me

865
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:47,080
 We are going to experiment see if we can do it ourselves, which is a little weird

866
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,860
 But we should be thanking everyone the way they should be doing it

867
01:15:53,860 --> 01:16:00,360
 But the way we simplified our patreon it seems like we will a be able to just be able to get lists ourselves and be

868
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,560
 We don't have a lot of

869
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,040
 Crazy deliverables anymore. So we can't have people write us and yell at us, which is also why we had any

870
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:13,240
 We think we're safe sure I think with the way

871
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,000
 Safer the digital rules are mostly doing kind of hang stuff and that kind of thing. So yes

872
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 Which is coming up soon beyond the lookout. We'll have that sometime next week. I'm planning great

873
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,820
 But we've been more community oriented with our patreon and it shows as our patreon has gone up a little bit and we appreciate that

874
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:36,040
 It really helps us out tremendously. It helps us in all that we do for us and our entire scoop community

875
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:43,340
 Yes, you want to contribute and you have room in your heart and your wallet for to support us head on over to preaching fun

876
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760

877
01:16:45,760 --> 01:17:09,880
 Or if you used to do some boring mundane job that you absolutely hated but now you're a Las Vegas entertainer

878
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:14,920
 Who's out there in the exciting industry of entertainment life in Las Vegas go over to farts in a bag dot biz

 That's farts in a bag dot biz that along with preaching fun.com it takes you over to our patreon page

880
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:33,480
 We're for as little as three dollars a month. You can help keep this show on the air

881
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,000
 I was just looking through our patreon page earlier today and

882
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:45,200
 I was looking through the the full list with like everybody who has ever been on our patreon at all and

883
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:51,320
 It was just a little walk down memory lane. It was so great seeing all the names of

884
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,400
 Current and former patrons and people who have been on there for a long time

885
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:01,240
 And I it has like they go away and they come back and then they were and I think you know

886
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,240
 And they go sorry. I had to take a break

887
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:10,360
 Look, you know no explanation any time you can find a little time to support us is just amazing and we're so grateful

888
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:16,620
 And if it can't be for your entire lives, that's that's okay, you know, we appreciate it

889
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:22,440
 And of course, we appreciate our long-term supporters very much as much. Yes, so

890
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:29,000
 But we truly we truly have such a soft spot in our hearts for everybody who supports us over there at preaching fun

891
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,880
 Dot com and farts in a bag dot biz because we couldn't do the show without you just very frankly

892
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,560
 We are dependent on our patreon supporters. We are dependent on our paid subscribers

893
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:44,260
 So if you think this show is worth more than zero dollars preaching fun.com farts in a bag dot biz

894
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,760
 That is the place that you can go. Oh

895
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,840
 It will scoop. Thank you for reminding me

896
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,620
 We do have our billionaire experiment still in the works

897
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:57,440
 The experiment is you're gonna give each of us a billion dollars

898
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:05,200
 So we need three billion dollars. Mm-hmm before taxes three billion dollars gross. I don't think we're completely clear on the financials here

899
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,940
 It can be crypto. It can be that fine with paying it paying back some of that

900
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:11,000
 Yeah, yeah

901
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,160
 No

902
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,600
 If we have to tax on it and whatever is income or however, we have to do that

903
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:20,960
 We'll figure that out on our end. Yeah, you don't worry about that. You just come up with the three billion even

904
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,120
 We might even bring any back to help us figure that one out. Yeah, we might we might

905
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,440
 Maybe a contractor fee. Yeah

906
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:28,920
 But yeah

907
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:35,180
 You give us the three billion dollars and we will see if we are better at being billionaires than the current billionaires out there

908
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:39,760
 You know, I'll go ahead and say it will even bring back the hands-less eating reward

909
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:48,440
 We learned the first time around we have to do it all in one we can't do like multiple sessions

910
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:54,320
 We have one hands-less eating session, you know, yeah, you know what the next has to be available at the where do we go?

911
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,720
 Eat that famous last night, you know the pepper mill menu the big step lucky for you

912
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,400
 Everything's on the pepper mill bin, right?

913
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:06,620
 You need to just sit seriously reinstate that on the patreon at the three billion dollar level

914
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:12,400
 We need to make a legit three billion dollar level on the patreon. You're right

915
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,860
 Eating video eating video three billion dollars

916
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,440
 You get three you get three

917
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:30,560
 Three billion you get one from each of us. Yeah, I like that before the government even right away

918
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,360
 We're giving away five percent to patreon like we would increase their stock price

919
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,480
 right

920
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,600
 Yeah, it would be it would be a big win day for them as well. If someone had three billion they give away

921
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,600
 They're gonna do it through patreon and not

922
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,560
 Pretty great. I just give it right to us. I mean, but you know what? Maybe they really want those videos

923
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,200
 And the other benefits that come

924
01:20:52,200 --> 01:21:00,000
 There are incredible benefits for being a patron at preaching fun calm

925
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,360
 Hit the production meeting music

926
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,440
 One hundred fifty million dollars by the way is what patreon's cut would be

927
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:34,160
 Patreon celebrities forever my

928
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:37,720
