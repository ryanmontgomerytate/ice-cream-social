15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,120
 I was gonna go to st. John Newfoundland and I was so excited turns out Canada's

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,600
 wicked wicked crazy with st. John's so it turns out it was st. John's New

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,320
 Brunswick and not they're lousy with st. John's now I already have an affection

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,480
 for st. John and the Virgin Islands right John's Newfoundland that I wasn't about

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,920
 to get off the boat for this st. New St. John I was like I don't have room I

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,080
 don't have room in my heart for a third st. John you have plenty of st. John's in

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:14,800
 your life you don't need more do any of these locations go by St. John because

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,920
 that's a real thing you know we're going from st. John's engine yeah well it's a

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,320
 there you remember a air wolf right of course I remember air ball so string

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,520
 fellow Hawk yeah he was always looking for his brother St. John and that is a

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,540
 shortened way of saying st. John so there were kids that were named St. John

26
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,120
 I just wondered if they ever if that ever applies to like cities I'll open my

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,560
 porthole and ask okay anyone go by St. John I'm just kidding my porthole over

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:58,040
 looks out into a wall so a wall in the boat yeah my porthole looks out into the

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,520
 vast six feet away as a wall that's what I oh you're just docked right now no no

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:11,240
 no no oh no you sure it's an internal hole it's an internal portal my god it

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,160
 is a glory pole I mean he might be docking right now as well

32
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,120
 oh yeah in a glory porthole that's cameras from the waist up so we have no

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,960
 idea we never will know are you ever gonna be on boats with pipe to plane

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:34,520
 again soon I don't know I'm on there they're joining the boat the ship that

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,280
 I'm on right now next week okay so ships in the night we we would have

36
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,160
 cross paths on the day yeah like I'm getting on the way I'm me getting off

37
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,280
 except that I am and now I have to get off early right here's the thing so I'm

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,440
 on the ship for four days and that's because originally they wanted me here

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,200
 for the week but the week started at scoop fest and I said I can't do it I

40
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,600
 got to go to scoop fest right then I got this offer for Virgin Voyages to join

41
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,320
 Virgin and that was a two-week gig so I want to say yes to that and basically

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,580
 saying told by agent I will I will let go of this gig if it means you know if I

43
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,040
 have to just just to still do virgin right yeah and that would give me days

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,960
 off after scoop fest that'd be nice so I was like there's no way they're gonna

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
 agree just to have me on this ship for four days but they're just going to just

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,760
 truncate the front and back end of the week and they did now you have discovered

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,560
 the true infinite money glitch that is cruise ship lines apparently what also

48
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,420
 meant and that means that I knew that I was getting on a performing like those

49
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:52,760
 and I was doing shows right and so was it when you got on yeah I didn't do two

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,520
 shows that night wow shows the next night holy shit dude how did that go

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,920
 luckily you were nice and rested so yeah so at scoop fest I had the already had

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,060
 this hard task of it that I've never go away for three weeks and I'm away for

53
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,080
 three weeks and then on top of the three weeks I'm going for in cruise ships I

54
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,000
 have two shows in Sparta New Jersey on October 16th and the improved jammer

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,940
 Union on October 18th October 17th is the smartest shows and so I had to pack

56
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,040
 for magic shows for all of those things plus materials you know I could go you

57
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,360
 know I go through materials things like that and and and so I was already pretty

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
 nerve-wracked plus I did magic at school fest which means I had to bring stuff

59
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
 just school fest so I had to bring it I had to perform them bring it home or whatever so

60
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,960
 the only chance I had to really pack with sanity was in the dinner break

61
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,440
 between daytime scoop fest and nighttime scoop fest on Saturday yeah right which

62
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,640
 was a two-hour break and it was like a true two-hour break because we finished

63
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,360
 up right before the break started in the daytime session so like we actually had

64
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,760
 about two hours between the daytime session and the Jog vs. Nerdball and

65
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,800
 during ice cream social I was getting notifications on my phone from Air

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,880
 Canada right and I was like that's weird I mean I'm flying tomorrow but I can

67
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
 check in sure whatever and they were and they were inappropriate messages right

68
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,360
 they were like dick pics and a lot of stuff yeah they're basically saying no

69
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,960
 there was they were showing you show me mine they're saying if you don't respond

70
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
 to these text messages we're putting these on the internet so you didn't

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,240
 respond and now they're out holy Mike Johnson

72
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:46,320
 but I don't know Paul Air Canada okay I've gotten an email like a week before

73
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,720
 whatever and I saw that they were shifting the time of my flight like a

74
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,400
 half hour earlier okay great what I didn't realize is that they also shifted

75
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,320
 it to a day early day earlier than a half hour earlier 24 hours and a half

76
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,840
 hour earlier yeah this is Air Canada not not not my cruise booker right yeah

77
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,960
 right I think it was booked and then the airline moved the thing well they moved

78
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:16,080
 oh it's Air Canada so the times are metric that explains it that explains

79
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,080
 that explains the disconnect it goes by how long it takes ice to melt that's how

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,720
 they ancient ancient Phoenicians had sundials most things in Canada are based

81
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,480
 on how long it takes ice to melt yeah that's right so I just spend the dinner

82
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,520
 break rescheduling my travel frantically just on the emergency line lines because

83
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,120
 suddenly I was not on the flight that I supposed to be on right and and I should

84
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,440
 have another like the whole that's the whole thing and so I could you know how

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,040
 to take the reservation but you don't know how to hold the reservation and I

86
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,720
 so I basically had to come back to the jock versus nerd ball without knowing

87
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,520
 what I was doing the next day and then at the end of the costume parade I got

88
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,200
 an email saying that I had to be on a flight at a 6 a.m. flight so I had to be

89
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:25,680
 at the airport at 445 of the morning that is some shit bags bullshit and then

90
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,760
 because it was a last-minute flight it wasn't direct so I had to take three

91
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:38,440
 flights to get to Canada oh holy fuck man so I was three flights total of 15

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,120
 hours by the time I got to my hotel they let you sit on the wing and then I'd

93
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,120
 asleep and get up right away and just get to the ship oh and then it's like go

94
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,200
 to the ship there's a guy on a bike he just goes Matt Donnelly he goes yeah he

95
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,680
 goes forgive me it's my day off and he's just dressed in like head-to-toe and

96
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,720
 beautiful biker riding bike outdoor gear right that's like forgive it stranger

97
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,200
 yeah but they're waiting for you get in there and I was like oh I said I can't

98
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
 have gone here any faster than me meeting my driver on time and my driver

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,080
 getting me out of time I don't know what I could have done yeah step on it

100
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,760
 waiting for me what yeah and then I see noted it for you if you get that get me

101
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,880
 there in time for my show I get around to the port and the the pork is we have

102
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,520
 no record of you being here I was literally just told two minutes ago and

103
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,080
 a hundred feet ago that you were waiting for me inside yeah apparently not that

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,940
 guy so finally a guy from business comes out and basically reprimands someone at

105
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,360
 the dock for looking up my thing improperly that person being very

106
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,360
 defensive and I was listening to a very snippy conversation guys guys guys

107
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,800
 could you please have this uncomfortable conversation after I get on to the boat

108
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,940
 I would like to get onto the boat you guys could have this conversation for as

109
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,320
 long as you want after I'm gone and so this is like normal little gang way it

110
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,640
 goes right up to the fourth deck yeah and then there's a zigzaggy gang way

111
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,760
 really long gang way that goes up to the seventh deck and and the first of a

112
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,360
 princess gestures me to the zigzaggy gang way that goes up three stories and

113
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,640
 I have two giant banks and my my backpack in banks and I was like are you

114
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
 sure I can't go up the little one yeah

115
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,700
 yeah but there's like no that's where most of the guests are getting off to

116
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:52,680
 go into it's a Saint John to Halifax and singe in Halifax and and so I go to move

117
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,340
 like all my stuff and there's a guy you know working for the cruise like an

118
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,760
 eager young young guy English other first language goes can I help you with

119
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,320
 that I was like boy can you he takes me up but I'm in a crew cabin not in a

120
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,920
 guest cabin yeah and so we get on the ship and I was like showing him my room

121
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,400
 number and he's trying to get me to this the seventh deck where the crew for the

122
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,600
 regular cabins right I'm trying to explain to him no no I'm in a crew cabin

123
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,240

124
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,920
 to each other and the janitor's like no follow me and I go through this ornate

125
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,600
 path we're all set I'm like outside of the ship on this weird deck area where

126
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,320
 I'm looking at the thing or I'm like I don't know if I this isn't supposed to

127
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,840
 be here then boom I'm into a crew area and then into finally into my cabin and

128
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 the good news is my cabin is 50 feet from the theater oh that's oh that's

129
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,960
 that's big that's big yeah yeah so I get all my stuff in the theater back in the

130
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,000
 thing and then I realized I should go get like a cup of coffee or something to

131
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,560

134
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,320
 I'm just trying to get to like the regular part of the ship or like where

135
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,120
 the passengers go or whatever and they go who are you are you supposed to be

136
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,000
 back here what are you doing there is a there is a hard line like I said when we

137
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,660
 were doing second city tours we had a very fortunate situation where we had

138
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,840
 passes that were literally crew and passenger status right we had both so we

139
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,260
 could we could go anywhere but yeah if you haven't been designated they get

140
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:50,480
 snippy yeah but they figured it all out did you do a little quick bit of table

141
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,520
 side honestly or did they harpoon you I straight up just I straight up just

142
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:00,040
 walked away I walked up to another floor I'm good and then I went up to you just

143
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,720
 left them arguing about who yeah I was like I don't want to I don't want to do

144
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:15,440
 this and no that's awesome later that's awesome be another way you know what I

145
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,880

 do two shows right away and they were really well good I was like I was like

148
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,720

 with Lisa.com that's where they help set up people want to see me on the ship and

152
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,520
 stuff and so Lisa his wife is on on the ship and I met her before she's come to

153
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,440
 my Elton shows they offered to take me out to dinner at the beautiful Crown

154
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,360
 Grill nice on my on the second night I was on board and then they were telling

155
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,600
 me about how they ran into people who saw my show on st. John and I was like oh

156
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,880
 I don't think they're gonna tell me a story where they complimented me she was

157
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
 like yeah one guy was like yeah it wasn't really for me mind reader guy or

158
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,880
 whatever and I was like why are you telling me this story yeah what the

159
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:41,400
 hell this next story super awkward then cuz I just saw several people that hated

160
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,880
 your show I understand I'm not for everyone as I said as I said it's good

161
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,280
 fest you know you know you're not for everyone but as soon as you hear it it's

162
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,540
 devastating so very critical about my outfit that I was wearing at the time it

163
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,600
 really hurt but they talked about how they basically said like oh we're going

164
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,720
 to the embassy the Crown Grill but they said the other name for another ship's

165
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:18,240
 stakeout so yeah Cagney's I think it was called okay and so then that so I go oh

166
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,020
 so they were coming here to this thing tonight that's what they told you they

167
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,440
 invited you to dinner to join them here and I go yeah so they're here yeah and I

168
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,040
 go like oh okay and we look around or whatever we don't see them just now

169
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,000
 getting back to my room from getting coffee for this episode I end up taking

170
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,720
 an elevator and two guys are like oh you're the mindbender guy and I go yeah

171
00:15:44,720 --> 00:16:00,200

172
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,240

173
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,040
 having dinner with Lisa and I go oh my god it's them it's the guys they were

174
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,680
 talking to it's the eyes not for me it's not for me guy

175
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:30,580
 amazing I'm face-to-face like a murder she wrote mystery novel we're like I

176
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,760
 had the key I had the key that they right they named the steakhouse the wrong

177
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:41,320
 steakhouse and it's the only thing they could have said to clue you in this

178
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:50,440
 confirmed but it did not enjoy my show yeah we saw you show the other night

179
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:59,760
 there were chairs and everything hey Oh Rica is making a great point in the

180
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,560
 chat here she's saying Matt is upset that no complements his show but when

181
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,280
 he runs into audience members he doesn't compliment them either and that's a

182
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,840
 really good point yeah I have to go back and tell those guys nice hats nice hats

183
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,040
 assholes let me have to do that oh you guys are great at Cagney's the other

184
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,520
 night I saw you order that steak amazing work yeah well we got a Rica I'm not

185
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,720
 upset that no one complements my show I'm thrown off when people insist on

186
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,480
 telling a story that someone did not enjoy my show that is weird man that's

187
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,280
 weird that was no problem hearing nothing that's different that's

188
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,440
 different is that what is that where your brain goes after you've booked

189
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
 people on thousands of travel experiences is that you just get to like

190
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,760
 oh yeah well you know a lot of people just hate you and they don't really yes

191
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,320
 I mean people definitely get into that state of mind of like none of this

192
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,080
 matters to me so why would it matter to you right yes right comes right that's

193
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,960
 the energy of like that we're just shooting the breeze I just know this I

194
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,600
 know that yeah these guys hated your show but it like in their mind she's

195
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,080
 sitting there thinking like oh Matt has done this show so many times well surely

196
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 people have disliked the show before it can't bother him it's just water off and

197
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,000
 ducks back like who cares we're being harsh too wasn't that he hated it just

198
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,600
 wasn't for him oh no no he actually sent me a message as well the way the story

199
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,760
 actually goes is that the subtext of the stories was told to me it basically

200
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,960
 didn't didn't believe I was an actual mind reader oh really well in that case

201
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,440
 I've got good news for them they were they were right so this is Simon Cowell's

202
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,560
 cousin and which is I should make no claims during my show that I like I set

203
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,640
 the premise but I do I do know I basically like all of my stuff as if I'm

204
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,800
 doing any mind reading bits it's all comedic right like I get the results

205
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,320
 correct but all I'm trying to do is make sure it's funny along the way and that's

206
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,800
 the it's the weird thing I imagine but you it's a you can't deny it if someone

207
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,120
 goes like yeah I don't think you really do that you're like yep that's right

208
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,480
 that's correct and so if you're upset with me for even towing the line for

209
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,200
 claiming to have superpowers I could if that upsets you I get it like I can't do

210
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,440
 anything about it it's it's it's it's the deal right all right I did it Jacob

211
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,920
 nailed it I said Oh Rico's name correctly on air oh nice oh I am

212
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,880
 impressed I know I am and I noted that I have never heard I'd never heard the

213
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,960
 pronunciation correct and I was like oh yeah Rica yeah yeah took me 12 years and

214
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
 and her something by African babble to get it right but that's what happened

215
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:55,000
 perfect finally got it oh man Jacob you asked me for a sponsor and I can't

216
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,520
 access my phone so I'm gonna go over to a web page and open it up there oh nice

217
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
 well while you're doing that we'll just we'll just talk a little bit scoop fest

218
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 here we just had our big scoop fest it was amazing it was oh we are all almost

219
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,280
 recovered and by all I mean like fucking everybody I imagine I mean I don't buddy

220
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:22,120
 yeah everybody got beat I didn't get kovat this time well there's that that I

221
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,640
 know of yeah but also like legit like I felt like everyone not just us I felt

222
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,560
 like the attendees were like Jesus by the end of the yeah well actually I was

223
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,080
 having a conversation with Ryre the night of the loadout because we even

224
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,720
 commented during the during the show during the scoop fest podcast that the

225
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,320
 energy you kind of like went weird in the room for a while and we were kind of

226
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,920
 chatting about that and the energy of the of the whole thing and it really

227
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:57,120
 seems like everyone came to scoop fest as you know in a way that you would

228
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,480
 expect which is a relief you know they're coming to scoop fest as this as

229
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,940
 a big energy relief thing and especially by the end of it everyone was kind of

230
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,200
 like sitting in that lull yeah I don't know it was it was a it was an

231
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,080
 interesting it was an interesting thing yeah I think I think so I think I think

232
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,560
 this I really you know we talked about this in a few episodes back but like I

233
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,240
 that is it is a crazy time yeah and I think and I think during Penn Sunday

234
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,680
 School live like Penn really hung a lantern on it in terms of talking to his

235
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,240
 children yeah you guys don't know that this actually is incredibly unusual

236
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,400
 right and like what's happening is impossible yeah and so you know none of

237
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,240
 this that is happening can happen it's none it's all impossible but it's

238
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,280
 happening anyway yeah yeah yeah and the shows also 12 years old or whatever 11

239
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,240
 years old and so are indeed our we've all gotten older we're older and so is

240
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,860

243
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,560
 the the nighttime programming and stuff I was like panicking trying to add stuff

244
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,680
 and then by the time it all went down I was like oh I put a lot of stuff up here

245
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,960

249
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,320
 it was the first time they'd seen a bucket show and I was like well hope you

250
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,400
 like that one because it's never gonna get any better than that

251
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,440
 was actively telling people to not come back to future bucket shows because that

252
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,800
 one was that was to be the best one I don't know if it went quite that far but

253
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,000
 I just said that is the best it's close yeah as close if you came to see both

00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:25,100
 comes to the front but yeah I do I really ate exactly a pine a plane played

301
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,760
 the the barbecue they were fantastic that was the that was the biggest swing

302
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:37,780
 I did I pulled for this one was that my friends from Ireland were all off they

303
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,600
 weren't they weren't obligated to be on ships and so I said if you're available

304
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,000
 let's get you in here and so they I flew them in from Ireland to be here is their

305
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:59,040
 first time in Vegas and they just were absolutely blown away by they exhausted

306
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,440
 and I had to write them a note being like you know it's very common that

307
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,360
 people love Las Vegas and also think three days is plenty right oh yeah and

308
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,520
 and that was the case for them they were definitely like just wiped at the end

309
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,320
 sure but they yeah they crushed it at Jacob's house and they're they're just

310
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,280
 that I love those guys so much and they're so charming and they're such

311
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,080
 they're great at what they do and it's they have such different personalities

312
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,640
 and they all find a way to really shine and it's really funny and I like them

313
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,560
 and so yeah they I was I was very emotional watching them play in Jacob's

314
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,600
 backyard that was yeah it was great it was a big carry deal for me and we were

315
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,560
 supposed to have you you're talking about the wind we were supposed to have

316
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,280
 another entertainer at the at the barbecue but the wind kept Michael Doe

317
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,600
 from being able to juggle at the barbecue right so Mike no it's Parkinson's yes

318
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,520
 and he asked it he said yes to do excuse us before he knew he had it right

319
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,800
 his obligation and then he has to juggle you know 500 throws every day to make

320
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,320
 sure he can keep movement in his body and be able to do what he does for a

321
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,920
 living while he fights this vicious disease and then it's fucking windy as

322
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,880
 hell yeah it's windy we might not go and I said oh you can't you don't want to go

323
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,440
 he goes well I can do it the show will be funny but there will be no juggling in

324
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,440
 it and then he said no successful juggling there will be throwing but not

325
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,440
 catching not catching I said okay let's let's let's just call it so I was so

326
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,080
 aggravated too because it was like it was perfect all afternoon and then like

327
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,880
 20 minutes before Godot was was set to go up that's when the wind kicked up

328
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,000
 yeah like it was it was and then like half an hour later it was it was back to

329
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,440
 be in like there was a light breeze but it was fine after that still but yeah

330
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,360
 it was crazy it was crazy for a minute yeah yeah and then but he still was

331
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,520
 phenomenal yeah well and then he did the variety show yeah yeah yeah so then that

332
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,840
 night we surprised the audience with a reuniting of two characters in a clown

333
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,920
 shortly after the very recent breakup of the podcast to do a podcast battle Jimmy

334
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,320
 Sonina dressed in full clown regalia he did was delightfully ironic because in

335
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,400
 their Cirque show it's Johnny and RJ have to wear a lot of makeup and Jimmy

336
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,000
 doesn't and so it was very funny for Jimmy to come in full makeup while

337
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,800
 they were there goes and we had delightful trivia battle hosted by Mikey

338
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,680
 for between between us and they won yeah they did spoiler because we're gonna put

339
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,120
 those in our patreon feed like always and so that was really fun then while I

340
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,360
 was doing my shows at the Magic Castle a month ago someone on my special

341
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,440

347
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,960
 illusion with Nick that he normally does with his wife and I love doing this bit

348

 this is a running gag right that was really funny that bit was funny

351
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,240
 Alex Ramone had a bit in his show where he has someone called misdirection and

352
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,920
 in his regular show he used to show girl as misdirection and we did the Magic

353
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,120
 Castle I came out as misdirection and the foolers tour I came out as

354
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,280
 misdirection and telling me to just improvise and dance and pretend I'm a

 thing in the show hot trashed or the pandemic where he tries to make a banana

444
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,960
 daiquiri while trying to still hit a triangle on the notes during this one

445
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,560
 song it's this conflict between trying to make the daiquiri and at the triangle

446
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,600
 all while he's wearing just a banana a skirt made of actual bananas right and

447
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,800

448
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,200
 burlesque world and then I had Jonas Wilberton and I forgot that I was also

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,360
 where he has the audience hit him with tennis balls and he does so he does a

451
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,960
 seer wheel which you know those of you in the circus world are familiar but

452
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,120
 those you may not be it's a big giant steer steel wheel it looks like a giant

453
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:30,960
 hula hoop a steel ring that he is able to manipulate and swirl around and this

454
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,480
 was a steel ring with a radius of about what six and a half feet or not a

455
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,360
 radio yeah what's the thing across the circle whatever that distance is right

456
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,560
 yeah this was the smallest stage he'd ever perform this yeah we only gave him

457
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,120
 eight feet of space he had done it on a on a nine footer I think maybe mm-hmm he

458
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,280
 he had kept asking me like there's a version I can do without the wheel I

459
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,000
 said then let's do that and he goes we'll just send me the dimensions anyway

460
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,680
 and I said in dimensions and he goes oh that's pretty small I go then don't do

461
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,120
 the wheel just do the other part yeah and he goes okay well I'll bring the

462
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,280
 wheel just in case and I go okay and then he sends me we load in and I see

463
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,800
 it's a carpeted stage which is again not ideal for zero so it's carpeted so if

464
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,720
 you don't want to do the wheel do not do the wheel and he goes all right I

465
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,660
 probably won't but I'll bring it just in case yeah and then not only was it

466
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:30,960
 carpeted but it had nth leaves and leftover banana daiquiri all over and

467
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,800
 tomato juice yes it had tomato seeds banana juice had fucking leaves so I

468
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,320
 would I had been sketching stuff away with my foot the whole time because I

469
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,920
 knew that wheel was coming I was trying to make sure that was oh yeah but oh

470
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,480
 y'all were we were all like try to clean the stage as much as possible I told

471
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,960
 him afterwards I said that was fucking brave dude and that was amazing but it

472
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,440

 doing stand-up yes not a not a show without Stephen yeah and without personal

477
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,080
 highlight for me was Michael Gudeau yeah yeah and seeing Mike do it seemed like

478
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,960
 you don't do it it was so good it was so funny and holy fuck yeah we talked

479
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,280
 about it at the at the con but uh you forget we're friends with Michael Gudeau

480
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,160
 we hang out we chat with Michael Gudeau we all forget that you get Michael Gudeau

481
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,240
 on stage and he's a goddamn killer I mean it's just what he's gonna get on

482
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:00,960
 stage just do it it's crazy to me too I was lucky enough to go see him with the

483
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,440
 Lance Burton show way back in the day right and this is when I was first

484
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:13,840
 working with Second City as a full-time Second City and class act that Lance

485
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,880
 Burton is he called me out in the show had me stand up and wave to the people

486
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,320
 because nice because Lance Burton knows how to be a fucking entertainer you know

487
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,040
 we help each other we talk each other up right that's what it's about and that

488
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,920
 that had that moment has stuck with me and just like the fact that Michael Gudeau

489
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:44,440
 and Mac King both specifically came out to watch us do the bucket show I got I

490
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,320
 put it up on our Facebook and whatnot Mac tweeted about it because he loves

491
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:55,160
 come see us which is just so amazing to me because he's one of my heroes too we

492
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,040
 have we have fucking strip performer royalty at this fucking thing yeah like

493
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,220
 real deal you can't get any higher on the total poll how many shows did he say

494
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:13,680
 he'd done it was 19 years 19 years thousands and thousands yeah I mean it's

495
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,400
 nuts and I just forget like he just gets the audience right in that pocket

496
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,360
 well he knows what he's doing and as soon as as soon as they're there you're

497
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:28,560
 like oh I forgot it's just cruises yeah from here like it just he just is so

498
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,920
 funny and there's so many gags and he just nails them and it just was like oh

499
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,720
 god it was great he really you really that was the second time I was very

500
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,080
 emotional at scoop fest was was that right there it was really awesome it's a

501
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,640
 big moment it's a big moment I again I'm just I'm just honored that that not to

502
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,600
 say that Harrison's ice stacking prediction via 9/11 theme didn't really

503
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,640
 I loved that too my brother was involved in that trick and that made it even more

504
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,120
 special for me it's only it's only appropriate because your brother was

505
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,280
 involved in the in the real day too right involved involved is a big way to

506
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:12,600
 say helped out with building seven but I mean you know you sure you say what you

507
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:22,500
 want to say involved masterminded I know he won't take credit for the master

508
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,840
 minding of it but that's only because he's modest then we had our mouth finger

509
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:35,160
 bottle competition oh yes oh my gosh it gets better every year I so all through

510
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,840
 scoop fest I make it a point so we you know our room there at the Orleans our

511
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,680
 big our big convention room there at the Orleans it's right off the main hall in

512
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,600
 their convention space there's other conventions going on while we're there

513
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,760
 there was some religious thing going on on one side of us there was a family

514
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,160
 reunion going on on the other side of us so I made it a point to as much as

515
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:02,840
 possible keep those main doors open no no just during the whole goddamn thing

516
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,640
 it is it is entertaining for me to watch people walk past those doors it's the

517
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,320
 reason that I keep them open I love watching watching people look in and be

518
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,600
 like I do it every year I love it during mouth there was a crowd of people at the

519
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:27,840
 doors with just pure confused look it was great at one point I went to you

520
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,360
 know use the facilities and I was in a bathroom stall in the men's room and I

521
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,280
 heard two guys talking go like yeah they're not really checking any badges

522
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,000
 over there that whatever that scoop thing is going on over there and then the

523
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,760
 other goes yeah but like what the hell is going on over there what guys like

524
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,880
 we could just go in there they're not gonna stop us and the other guys like

525
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:56,320
 yeah but should we do I want to do that dare I dare I let my freak flag fly what

526
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,280
 I'm trying to put an obelisk I believe inside of me I don't know how they were

527
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,840
 gonna do it that makes me laugh they're not checking badges like you wouldn't

528
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,040
 know like you wouldn't stick out like a sore fucking thumb if you weren't a

529
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:13,120
 scoop or if you weren't at least down to clown this year our mystery our mystery

530
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,520
 gift was a fez yeah where you could be jeweled so we had a bejeweling station

531
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,600
 you could you could you could which was a stroke of genius by the way that

532
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,960
 bejeweling station was that worked out well that goes that I mean he's here and

533
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,040
 that goes that Michael Osroth is basically our director of scoop fest at

534
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,720
 this point he really is he did a fantastic job with these these turned out

535
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,280
 awesome he kicks everything uphill for us well we tried it well we all pull our

536
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,780
 hair out trying to pull off school fest and and acts as a wonderful ambassador he

537
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:51,320
 and Laurie in the party room to help really initiate and introduce other

538
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,040
 scoops to each other in the party room really gets the conversations going and

539
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,080
 that that vibe carries on to the show itself we were running into new tariff

540
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,160
 shit we were running into all kinds of stuff yeah and I we really wanted pink

541
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,000
 robes to continue the robe theme to figure out the Neapolitan effect we had

542
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,120
 vanilla now we have a strawberry and and and then what's coming next chocolate

543
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:24,880
 robes get warm and some experience pain I said I do an idea to mess with it okay

544
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:33,080
 but but I don't remember the game of the idea of fans but then says I think I

545
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,340
 think it was me it might have been you I mean we can look through that we can

546
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,520
 look through the text but I think it was me I'm not taking I know it wasn't me so

547
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,400
 that's I'll give you full credit okay it was me it was it was you or it was you

548
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,920
 or Michael yeah me and Michael I think but Mike but again so many times we're

549
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,280
 like oh because of this is getting expensive because of this we can't do it

550
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,760
 or whatever and else from just kept after it yeah to make sure that we had

551
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,120
 everything we wanted to deliver to the scoops the way we wanted yeah I have

552
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,520
 ideas and Michael actually makes them happen

553
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:09,440
 I'd yeah exactly ideas yeah those you guys listening just just picture casino

554

 the show to several people asked about it at scoop fest people saw some medical

600
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,920
 attendants checking out Mikey at one point that was just a it was a very

601
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,600
 minor thing no big deal everybody is perfectly fine it was the casino being a

602
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:37,800
 little overly cautious just having their people check check Mikey out after a

603
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,800
 little slip and fall that we checked on him he was okay everybody's good they

604
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,600
 were they were everybody was healthy and happy oh then we had oh Celestia thank

605
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,800
 you scuba cabra in the chat for reminding me Celestia was there doing

606
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:59,800
 caricatures yes jock versus third ball whole every time I walked over to see

607
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:05,280
 what she had done for for a new group of people over there it was more

608
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,600
 disgusting and more wonderful than anything I will say my brother was like

609
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:16,000
 ooh we should get a we should get a caricature and so I did play my scoop

610
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,840
 card and got cut sees in line to do a dare you I know but it was you know my

611
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,240
 brother I see my brother maybe twice a year if I'm lucky in person so it was

612
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:34,360
 really nice to actually get a moment to to have this and we've got a really

613
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,500
 special year we have to get Celestia to do one of the three of us yes yes we

614
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,520
 should well I mean shit she'll do that it's hard to go sit for anytime you know

615
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,160
 what maybe we can have her do that during the zoom because we're having her

616
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,760
 on soon maybe we can do that because I'd love to I'd love to get one and put out

617
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,960
 put it up in the new chart well we'll talk we'll talk to her about that when we

618
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,360
 have her on next and see if she can just watch us during a zoom if that would be

619
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,000
 enough for her to get us I'm sure it would would work yeah so she was

620
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,160
 incredible like and also I had a personal highlight with the Pollywood

621
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:18,520
 Squares that fucking talk tell us about Pollywood Square what happened there so

622
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:24,160
 I was a little worried because of the board I was kind of like all this work

623
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,840
 into this fucking thing and if this doesn't go well it's gonna be the worst

624
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:34,560
 but then Ryerson who fest I was like the only note I have was not enough Paul

625
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,600
 my whole thing and so like like we did a lot of stuff a lot of things but Paul

626
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,160
 you know was not I basically was like Paul is funny we're trying to get him

627
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,520
 involved we were trying to get you to host a little bit of the trivia battles

628
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,440
 and so the adjustments we made was let's let's take on everybody in trivia so

629
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,120
 that it's right it's it's Paul and us against everybody instead of having two

630
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,080
 podcasts face each other right and then my brain was like oh Hollywood Squares

631
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,120
 but everyone's Paul it's Paul's characters all of Paul's characters and

632
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,520
 I in we reach out big there's a way to do with technology but well I go no no I

633
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,840
 want a physical clunky awkward big square yes where we have to move squares

634
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,840
 around Paul and I got of course turn to Ryar Apple door and to be like you you

635
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:24,720
 know what I'm talking about you know what this means so Ryar Apple turn made

636
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,440
 the biggest clunkiest Hollywood Squares board that could even fit through the

637
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,280
 door right with hangable X's and O's that was like nine feet what was it was

638
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:41,280
 like nine it was huge yeah and and that was the thing Ryar and and Mike were

639
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,320
 bringing it out and Ryar said they couldn't hardly fit it through the door

640
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,120
 right and it started well they couldn't fit it through the door that's why they

641
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,200
 had to come through the a different area they started from backstage on stage it

642
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,160
 started to crumple and bend and fuck up and the moment it started to just fall

643
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,600
 apart Ryar was just like oh this is gonna be perfect and he was right he was

644
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:08,320
 right the stupidity of it all just added just layers of dumb and it just oh it

645
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:14,660
 was so good it was down here you were Paul Lind Johnny Australia yeah Truman

646
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:23,080
 Capote which is a new one earlier in the day mum-rah mum-rah my favorite Paul

647
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:31,120
 Stanley vampire Bill Cosby yeah child barrel child yeah oh man and it was we

648
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,040
 were just asking trivia questions and making Paul's characters answer all of

649
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,760
 them Paul just came buckled right into the format of knowing how to play

650
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,760
 Hollywood Squares and I've watched a lot as a kid yeah yeah and it was

651
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,920
 hysterical it was so fun it's really good I was like and I was like you were

652
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,280
 like I would know I was like this is I as soon as it came to my head I was like

653
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,560
 hit it's in and it was floating is like I could we could do this multiple times

654
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:07,180
 like I was like if anything falls short I was like yeah we could just do another round with more

655
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,200
 characters even one point James like well if it's good and I was like no no

656
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,080
 this is good I don't know why there was doubting I don't know why there was

657
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:22,800
 doubting this pimping Paul nine times is exactly what the show needs and at the

658
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:27,600
 end Paul was almost guilty about how well I went he said so it felt a little

659
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:37,360
 self-indulgent and I was like right your festival it's true yeah yeah we're at a

660
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,000
 festival of you it's talking about yeah it's all good we're at a festival about

661
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,360
 you yeah and we are celebrating a show that has your name in the title it was

662
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,660
 it's it's possibly a little self-indulgent in some way the whole

663
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,560
 thing is self-indulgent it's now on the list right with mouth finger butthole

664
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,200
 that is now just a it's it's just on the list yeah yeah it's like that could be

665
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:09,160
 done at churnouts - yeah yeah well now I've got an idea for it for for zoom -

666
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:14,600
 I've got an idea for it for on camera oh hell yeah yeah mini version that Paul

667
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,340
 can just stick his head through that sounds fucking fantastic it's gonna be

668
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:27,280
 great that is good good good it was fucking hot shit and it made me laugh too

669
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,640
 so that was great yeah yeah I'll tell you what else Paul is gonna stick his

670
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,360
 head through and that's the following sponsor pizza for your hands that's

671
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,780
 right no more chewing with that pesky mouth of yours now there's pizza for

672
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:54,400
 pants hello I'm Reginald Felicity Guinevere and I have invented pizza

673
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:01,600
 mittens that's right pizza mittens cooked fresh every day made to order

674
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:09,120
 slathered in the finest of pasta sauces and mozzarella cheese the mittens are

675
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:15,520
 then placed on your hand piping hot and it's like the old Edward 40 hands days

676
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,600
 remember those days remember being an Edward 40 hands do you ever have friends

677
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:25,360
 do that to you and when 40 hands they would take a cold 40 of alcohol and they

678
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:30,940
 would duct tape the 40 to your hand and then you had to drink the 40 because

679
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:37,440
 it was so cold to drink the 40 quickly to stop all the coal so it gets you

680
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,840
 drunk really fast there's a similar thing but with pizza as mittens and so

681
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,640
 the pizza comes on it's pretty hot so you got to eat the pizza very quickly to

682
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,680
 get the heat off your hands but then the heat goes in your mouth and you burn

683
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:55,400
 your mouth but it's still really good it's still really really good yes yes

684
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:09,320
 yes and her hay scoops to check out so then what else what else was oh Gabrielle

685
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:15,920
 Lester just destroyed she just crushed Gabrielle yeah so fun and that was

686
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:24,160
 Carrie's mom who was up there with her I believe she's just known as mama scoop

687
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,540
 now yeah so so for those of you who don't know I hope I'm not putting

688
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,640
 anybody on blast here but Carrie brought her sister and her mother which is great

689
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,880
 and I think her sister spent more time than she thought she would hanging out

690
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,200
 with some of the events her mom certainly did her mom wasn't sure she was

691
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,000
 gonna enjoy it at all clearly she did oh by the end of it her mom was in yeah and

692
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,360
 I thought even by the end of it halfway through it mom was in I believe this was

693
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,360
 on Friday they got the hard news that their brother had suffered a stroke mmm

694
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:02,040
 oh jeez yes and it's so that yeah mom was upset sisters upset carries upset

695
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,320
 they're all fucking you know it's rough because it's in fees in Florida right

696
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:14,480
 what can you do luckily scoop fest acted as a distraction and by the end of the

697
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,120
 event his health had improved he was doing much better of course still you

698
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:27,880
 know not an ideal situation but things are going better and yeah yeah yeah so I

699
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:34,880
 think not only did it like it helped as a distraction and everything but yeah

700
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,920
 it was really cool seeing mama scoop find out what this community is all

701
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,880
 about and kind of just get with it crazy the shenanigans that is involved in this

702
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:55,240
 community yeah yeah but yeah Gabrielle was was great and then we brought back

703
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,920
 the pineapple and people to play for everybody to play for all the people not

704
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,920
 just the barbecue and of course that culminated with sweet Caroline we finally

705
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,840
 got to combine the the two bits the one the one that we do yelling fucking whore

706
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:15,400
 in between the bits and then again a great time to be looking out of the

707
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:22,480
 front door of the convention hall and watching the people walking by oh I bet

708
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,720
 I bet did they lose their fucking minds I bet those oh pure confusion it's

709
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:34,440
 wonderful and then adding in I don't believe you you're making it up and so

710
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,000
 we finally got both bits combined into sweet Caroline yeah and well we were

711
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,640
 shouting it Phil just turned to Fionn and said what is happening right now who

712
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,960
 knows they were confused but they loved it right I mean they just yeah well

713
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,640
 here's the funniest thing okay so one of the things that happened behind the

714
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,120
 scenes was you know they say we'll take requests and we we had them take a break

715
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,520
 to do Hollywood squares and so in the break people come up to me giving

716
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,280
 different songs you know one of the things that what's it called Princess of

717
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,200
 the City or whatever that's not the famous average song is by the Pogues oh

718
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:16,400
 it's a what's it called a New York City fairy tale or something like that yeah

719
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,720
 fairytale of New York that's what it's called very very New York it's a

720
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,400
 traditionally Chris it's a Christmas song but it's it's crazy it's about the

721
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,600
 deterioration of this long-term relationship these two people that grow

722
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,200
 to hate each other and yeah it's really it's a beautiful song but it isn't

723
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,680
 traditionally traditionally a Christmas song they're just cracking up going like

724
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,760
 I guess we'll just play it even though it's a Christmas song Merry Christmas

725
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,080
 yeah and then another song someone came up to Fionn and again just like you know

726
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,440
 time and culture and everything else he's the he plays the flute in the band

727
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,400
 and someone came to Fionn was like oh would you play like the orange flute of

728
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,600
 blah blah blah or whatever I don't know the name of the song no that was it and

729
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:05,520
 film just dead face was like ah maybe I don't know if we know that one and in

730
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,840
 this face is that it is a song about the English like conquering the Irish like

731
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:16,800
 the orange flute is about like the orange like yeah yeah it's like you

732
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,000
 were not playing that it's like when I first when I first start when I was

733
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,640
 first sitting there at the barbecue watching I was like I wonder if they'll

734
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:29,280
 do like the the Outlander theme and I was like that's Scotland you dumb I didn't

735
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:37,560
 say anything but I was like the Outlander theme that would be that's

736
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,160
 fucking Scotland you don't even yeah shut your fucking yeah people who are

737
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,440
 from Scotland do not want to be told they're from Ireland and vice versa and

738
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,800
 vice versa it's very key thing I don't know why anyone would do it yeah very

739
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,320
 crazy Ozzy no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna touch that so there we go and they

740
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,240
 never played long distance no they didn't play long distance but we didn't

741
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,560
 ask we didn't ask him to learn long distance that's okay I'm sure they know

742
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,520
 it I'm sure I'm sure they've just picked it up by just hearing it on the radio on

743
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:11,400
 the international radio stations all the time so that being like I can't believe

744
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:17,360
 somebody's asked that's great basically get any other situation we would just be

745
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,400
 entirely offended but it was like let's just let it go I'm sure it was just an

746
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,640
 earnest request and not a lot of behind it not realizing what it meant and yeah

747
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:35,320
 yeah yeah yeah that's amazing that's amazing yeah it's horrific and orange

748
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:46,680
 flute that's it the old orange flute oh yeah yeah this is just this is about

749
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:55,120
 this is a story of the Irish version of Benedict Arnold basically betraying the

750
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:02,000
 Irish to the English yes so now so now it's not a song that they play all the

751
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,640
 time is it but it but it isn't a traditional Irish song and not it did it

752
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,520
 recounts a terrible time for the Irish but it is the one that I'm finding here

753
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:16,480
 is by the Dubliners and it was done in 19 it was released in 1965 so that would

754
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,640
 be that would seem to say it well it is a traditional Irish song but just of a

755
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:28,000
 very sensitive topic yeah probably so it'd be to be a different thing if we've

756
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,560
 gotten out we've gotten out of the knowledge that I have I okay I have is

757
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,740
 entirely based on reading these lyrics here and that's it I love that they did

758
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:42,280
 a Wild Rover because when I used to sing at the bar at Star Trek the experience

759
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,760
 when I was doing I'd do a Klingon opera occasionally we would get some Irishmen

760
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:51,880
 in who and we'd swap songs it was great and they did Wild Rover and I learned

761
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:59,120
 Wild Rover yeah and so I knew Wild Rover and then but I knew a call for Wild

762
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,400
 Rover it's an offensive call I don't know they were ready for it I don't know

763
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,040
 if they've ever heard it but it's you know that I've played the Wild Rover for

764
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:15,000
 many a year and I don't know this but but then it goes and it's no name never

765
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:22,440
 right up your ass no never her no more will I play the Wild Rover no never no

766
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:28,420
 more so but that I learned that from other Irishman so it is a legit call

767
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:35,800
 response move for that song but yeah that was great they played that one too

768
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,560
 yeah yeah they were just it was great and I sent them to they got to go to

769
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,600
 Mystere while they were here oh fantastic did they get to do a backstage tour - no

770
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,720
 they had to get back and play the show well at least they got to see it that's

771
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,600
 cool I said I sent to Piff Piff the next day so you'd see Piff show the next day

772
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:59,240
 yeah next day Penn Sunday School live if you it's coming out this week just just

773
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,360
 check it out Penn coming back from England fighting a nasty nasty cult yeah

774
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,280
 tough it out for scoop fest of him telling a story about Piff Piff is there

775
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,360
 so Piff comes out from backstage and surprises the audience and it's Piff the

776
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:19,880
 magic dragon and he's got a steel chair I got to do my if impression just spot on

777
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,080
 yeah oh yeah yeah like Gudeau said and it was a really good it was a really

778
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,800
 really fine episode of Penn Sunday School especially health is considered

779
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,840
 Penn's health but it was it was great yeah then Piff stayed by he broke down

780
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,800
 his appearance on Foolish with Hondreau yeah it was funny that's the funniest

781
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,760
 thing is that you know Penn one Piff I know if Penn was sticking around Penn

782
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,840
 couldn't stick around because he was sick you want to know if Hondreau's gonna

783
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,720
 call in the Hondreau wasn't available to call in sent a small video but I was

784
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,960
 like I was there I'll help or whatever and I just should know better by now that

785
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:53,000
 Piff the magic dragon is always ten steps ahead of everyone has already

786
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,720
 planned everything yeah and so I tried you'll hear if we play that if we'll

787
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,960
 play it on those feet or not I'm not sure I don't think it's maybe it's good

788
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,320
 audio without video but I tried to help early and then there's a point where I

789
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:11,120
 just realized I should just shut up he's got it he's got it yeah yeah and and he

790
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,760
 just it just did a very funny presentation of all of breaking down his

791
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:22,460
 this is disastrous appearance it was a disaster it was it was funny to watch

792
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:29,280
 live I mean it really is it's up there with your cutting the tip of your finger

793
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:35,080
 off at that performance that you did I mean it's the same kind of thing yeah

794
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:40,880
 and if I had a perfect sense of humor about it it was great oh yes and Hondreau

795
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,680
 will probably develop a sense of humor about it one day well I mean he was good

796
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:51,640
 enough to leave a message that was nice yes yeah that we do a trivia battle with

01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:05,080
 Irish nachos yes yes and they loved them oh my god yeah I said I said I was

888
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,800
 afraid to even show you this whether you think it was like offensive to you or

889
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,000
 whatever oh and they go well there's nothing like that in Ireland but boy

890
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,680
 there should be this is really good they're really blown away particularly by

891
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:19,000
 the nacho beef the beef that goes on the Irish nachos right and it sounded

892
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,480
 like an Irish stew beef the corn beef the nacho beef yeah no it wasn't corn

893
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:28,000
 beef just the regular ground beef oh okay they're spiced ground beef yeah oh

894
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,200
 but the way they make it at the at the McMullin's they're like this tastes

895
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,640
 like Irish like stew beef this doesn't taste like nacho beef and they were like

896
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:40,720
 flipping out about it oh that's cool devoured two plates of Irish nachos

897
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:48,160
 blown away yes though three who's super that was that was my favorite but I sent

898
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,120
 them a picture with them in front of the plate I said my four favorite Irishman

899
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:57,960
 it was the three of them in a plate of Irish my favorite Irishman and my three

900
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,440
 friends from Ireland the country's not chiming in it's the same beef they use

901
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:11,320
 in their Shepherd's pie there yes and this way it's like it's like it's

902
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,400
 actually why I like I like that we do every year and a half for a variety of

903
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,880
 reasons one is right now to give us breathing room to not think about the

904
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:24,120
 next one oh to like that extra six months like our lives change enough that

905
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:28,200
 different people come into our lives to bring to scoop fest yes you know we get

906
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,280
 to include different people in it and so that's like really always kind of

907
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:38,540
 exciting to do and and and also we lose track of how many we've done so it makes

908
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,800
 them all really special because I'm like I don't know how many like how many

909
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,240
 businesses I'm like I have no idea I don't know and how awesome I think it

910
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,760
 was was it you Matt or Jacob one of you two what me came up with the thought of

911
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:56,580
 selling twenty twenty seven scoop fest

912
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:08,200

915
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:25,960

 scoop fest were able to buy super early bird tickets or the next event yeah yeah

917
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:38,440
 yeah but that just now I was one to say with that was that it just to me speaks

918
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:43,960
 so highly of people trusting us and then being enthused about this event yeah

919
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:50,260
 that's not even announced yet right well the people that basically okay the

920
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:53,400
 people that come a year after year after year and I really wanted to reward them

921
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,640

922
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,920
