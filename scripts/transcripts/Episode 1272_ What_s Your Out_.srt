 Airing this show we're airing from the past. I've had a birthday. I bet it went wonderfully

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,760
 I had a little vacation. I bet it went wonderfully Matt. You're on the road non-stop right now. What's going on with you?

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,540
 This I'm trying to think of what this is Aaron because I am doing this thing where I have to go to Chicago

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,160
 Yeah, do one show and then get up the next morning and fly out to

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,480
 St. Louis and then drive to a gig in Missouri two hours from the airport

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,600
 Do a corporate show that's supposed to be blood money. So this will certainly come up on the show again

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,320
 Yeah, because we a lot of drunk people go back to Chicago finish out of Chicago Magic Lounge where I'm going to turn around

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,760
 And then go home

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,800
 For for the holidays and then after the holidays it go right back out. I got a corporate in South Bend, Indiana

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
 whoa

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,160
 and then I'll be heading to the Jokers of Magic after that which I'm so excited about and

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,280
 While you're in South Bend, are you going to air your grievances with the Notre Dame football team and their new?

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,920
 Scheduling thing that they're gonna do with the college football playoff. That's a big part of your dress gonna be wearing Miami shorts and Alabama

31
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
 sweatshirt

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
 Just whistling. Yeah

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
 I'm also gonna be doing a comedy club in Chicago, which I have to get more details on but I'm one of the off nights

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
 We have like one random off night

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,200
 On the tour and Mike Mills arranged for us to give it give us a shot in a comedy club

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,260
 Which I'm so excited about it's gonna be Chicago right the comedy club in Chicago

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,280
 Which means it's for people out there who are near there. It's a little more affordable than the old

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,920
 Chicago Magic Lounge, so

39
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,120
 Hopefully you can come out and check out that this is part of the Jokers of Magic tour, right?

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,080
 Yes, so it'll be it'll be if me myself Mike Mills Eric Dittleman Ruben Moreland who I'm so excited

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,560
 I don't think a lot of people know Ruben, but you will know and love him. I'm so excited be doing the tour with him

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,120
 Oh, very cool. He's a very funny like a ball. We'll get him on the pod as well

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,800
 Are all four of you gonna do the comedy club or is it yes, just no. Okay. Yeah. Yeah also fun

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,180
 So you guys you guys get to kind of kind of write up stuff for a smaller stage then yes

45
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,080
 Yeah, yeah, and I could do more crowd work and things like that that I'm excited about and

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,880
 Yeah

47
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,320
 My secret goal is to be comedy club worthy

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,080
 This is why I'm trying to I'm trying to cajole Brian brushwood and to into maybe thinking about doing his first show since 2010

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,440
 He's done some shows here and there, but he hasn't truly

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,200
 Tored like going on done shows since 2010 which is a crime right a crime a crime is people who?

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,460
 We like that guy, and I think I think it's fine

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,760
 This is here's here's my options as a as a pro right the Jokers of Magic. Hopefully this becomes a thing

53
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,320
 It's a lot. It's a lot of heavy lifting right now to do any kind of live theater and any kind of live touring right now

54
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,720
 Just for the for the people living in the middle to lower class we are in a recession for people in the upper class

55
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
 Hopefully they want to come see tours

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,360
 That's where we're at that's where all of entertainment is at right now that is that is

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,600
 Desperately true yeah, this is why concerts are crazy expensive is because there's enough rich people that that they can afford that oh

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,240
 The sphere just put out numbers yesterday for what they what they say they've made on the Wizard of Oz oh

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,420
 And it's like two hundred million dollars. Yeah, and it's I mean it's it's still yeah, and they're still in the red

60
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:15,760
 But you know

61
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
 So

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,920
 You know when I try to think about like what I want to do

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,560
 It's like I can try to produce my own shows and try to do like hotel hotel the hotel model where you do like

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,920
 You team up with a fancy hotel you put like an awesome right together make it like a a wine and whatever and do that kind

65
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,000
 Of stuff, but that involves production value, which means like hauling things in

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,740
 You know putting a pipe and drape and that kind of stuff and having a lighting package and an audio thing

67
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,740
 And I was like no no no no I love performing comedy clubs. I

68
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,160
 think

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,160
 This is me. This is I'm just this is the real deal. This is what I'm talking to my friends privately is that yeah

70
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,180
 I think magic is a bigger addition of a factor to a comedy club

71
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,480
 Then comedy is an addition as a factor to magicians in a theater does that make sense I?

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,440
 Think you're absolutely right when I used to work at the Laugh Factory

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,160
 every now and then a magician would come through and

74
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,720
 Honestly for better or worse sometimes

75
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,040
 It would change the dynamic of the room completely yeah

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,920
 And so when the magician came through and they were good it was like holy shit. This is great

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,080
 This is built for this and when they came through and it was bad

78
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,600
 They were like oh, this is this is supposed to be funny

79
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,660
 And it's terrible and that's it and that there is there's a there's a there's a lot of there

80
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,980
 There are cheeseball magicians out there doing cheeseball comedy that doesn't that puns and and I win you lose

81
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,440
 Lines and that kind of stuff

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,000
 that I hate so it's but that's so that's the obstacle but I think like in terms of like where I think I can put my

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,800
 Effort to improve to I can do something and where I think the show would be additive and where it doesn't attack my weakness

84
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,480
 Which is adding crazy. I'm not a good tech person so adding crazy production values not my strength I

85
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,360
 Think Amy at comedy clubs would be great, and then should it work should it work at all?

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,240
 Then it's easy to add Paul. It's easy to add other acts to the lineups and stuff to make it an even crazier cooler

87
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,920
 varietal of a show

88
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,160
 But but this is this is in the meantime. I'm just bound to cruise ships while I figure all this out

89
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,800
 Yeah, yeah, and it's also a matter of just like you said before the timing of everything and where the country is financially

90
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,920
 God bless Mike Mills Mike Mills is trying to make sure the jokers of magic gives it a shot

91
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
 He's trying to find smart ways for us to tour

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,280
 It is an uphill battle for all tours right now, and he runs a giant touring company

93
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,720
 So when he says that he's talking he's talking with evidence about you know 25 properties that he tore

94
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,840
 Oh, yeah, you know like Mills entertainment. You know that with a John Kenny documentary was touring with

95
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,840
 with different guests high-end guests you know like

96
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,240
 Talking about John Kenny and people worked with him and Ryan Reynolds was hosting all that

97
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,240
 That was Mills entertainment right you might have even seen tik toks and stuff with stand by me cast the whole stand by me cast is

98
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,120
 Reunited yes, they're starting that is that is that one of his production as well. Yeah, yeah

99
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,240
 So it's a brilliant idea by the way. That's it so they're being very he's locking into some good stuff there

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,960
 They've always been very innovative

101
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,040
 With their touring and they've and then they've always been really cool stuff

102
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,920
 But he has data when he says it is a crazy slog right now to be trying to fill get button seats and theaters

103
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,840
 He means it and so I am feeling very fortunate that he is putting me in the mix

104
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,400
 But it's a horror thing that should property and that's it

105
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,560
 I think that we are trying to make this viable

106
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,320
 you know put some butts in seats and with the idea that we're playing a long game of

107
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,080
 Trying to make this a thing that happens semi regularly

108
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,840
 Until the economy kind of turns around for some people and we can go go go actually bring it to the people in a regular way

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,800
 Yeah

110
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,640
 I mean, I remember 2008. That's what I had to do, you know boats boats kept me going for

111
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,760
 nine months

112
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
 right basically a year I had to be away for a year to

113
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,800
 Keep it cooking with the same kind of financial realities that were around for entertainment. It's crazy times

114
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,840
 So all had to sell boats. Let's get into whether or not Mike Mills is a fool for relying on me

115
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,160
 So I am was finishing up show. I have a guess

116
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,960
 I was finishing up shows in on the princess cruise ship and I the last day of the cruise

117
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:39,360
 Not disembarkation day, but the day before your last day at sea as we were heading towards Florida, okay, I locked myself out of my room I

118
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,200
 Told the story on Penn Sunday school, but you know Penn just kind of laughed at me and then you know

119
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,680
 I figured you can get more mileage here

120
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,280
 and it's also I told Penn we recorded the day that it happened and

121
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,200
 Now we're we're a weekend change later and I'm still still processing so it's worth bringing up again because I'm still oh my

122
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,480
 so I

123
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,040
 Get online, but you okay to get back into my room and

124
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,880
 It's a long line. So we said like you don't want anything to go wrong in the last day of the cruises because that's the day

125
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,320
 Well, my god, there's so much stuff going on with people getting stuff approved. Oh like a customer service line

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,240
 Yes. Yeah, you're waiting in a customer service line to get a key to get back into your room

127
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,760
 Yes, and that's the day I was wondering why there was a line in front of your room to get back in

128
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,520
 Oh, sorry. No. No, thank you for you probably clarifying for listeners as well. Good job and

129
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:38,860
 You're at customer service everybody's at customer service because it's the end of the cruise and everybody is I'm sure very happy with all of the

130
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,620
 Accommodations and things that they have paid for on the cruise and they are there to tell customer service just how happy they are, correct

131
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,120
 Good, and so I'm it's I'm online like I was like I blew it

132
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,680
 I had my headphones with me because I like myself because I was gonna go to the gym and I and I okay headphones

133
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,440
 And not my key

134
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,400
 So I'm listening to podcasts for like 20 minutes and then I finally get to like on deck

135
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,760
 Before I go to my little desk and there's a circle of desks waiting for people or about like, you know

136
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 Six different customer service people

137
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,320
 Okay of these desks you kind of you got to answer like a lollipop you come up though

138
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,200
 You're alive. I'm picturing a circular room. Yeah. Yeah, and then I

139
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,680
 Take off my headphones

140
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,560
 Because I'm on deck getting ready to rock and about six feet to my right is a guy complaining about

141
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,980
 His bill on spellbound, which is the name of the Magic Castle experience that I'm a part of

142
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:39,880
 He was like I did not mean to tip the magician

143
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,120
 So much money I meant to tip the magician several hundred dollars

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,960
 But I tipped them too many hundreds of dollars. So I need I need some of that money back from the magician

145
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,160
 So I can get home. That's that's what the whole problem was. Yeah. Look, it's a big experience and you know, you can

146
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,280
 It's it's a bunch of people like coming around and so like, you know

147
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,860
 Who knows which part of the experience he wasn't happy with you know, okay drinks could have been the whatever

148
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,180
 And then he starts saying like yeah, the magician was just terrible

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,100
 This guy has gone to a customer service representative on a cruise ship

150
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,800
 To talk about a show that this customer service representative

151
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,360
 Certainly hasn't seen he wants his drinks taken off of his bill

152
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,800
 He doesn't want to pay for the drinks that he doesn't pay for the drinks because the entertainment was not great. That's right

153
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
 Okay

154
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,440
 Huh? This is a schemer and I'm on the other end of that when I go see a show when the entertainment is not great

155
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,360
 I am more reliant on the drinks than I usually

156
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,000
 Those are the shows that I do not dare complain about the drinks. Yeah, and

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,520
 I am like, well, there's two magicians. Maybe he's complaining about the other magician

158
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,240
 Then of course he was

159
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 Okay, I did

160
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,860
 26 shows on this last run on princess. Okay 26 in one week

161
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
 Over seven days. Yeah

162
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,800
 Wow, okay. Sometimes that's it. That's multiple shows a day sometimes for 30 people sometimes for two

163
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
 Okay, that's the deal

164
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,760
 It was a shift recently right where normally it was always for 30 some odd people

165
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,120
 It was always a always a that they wouldn't give me a show unless they packed the theater

166
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,200
 But right they change the way the experience works and how who can sign up for it and when and so you kind of have to

167
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,040
 Take people as they come and you end up. Yeah, he goes for people. So it's really weird to give a theatrical

168
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,320
 Magic experience to eight people. Yes

169
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 however

170
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,520
 One day goes he goes yeah, I mean, you know he started off with like, you know

171
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,720
 You can't someone take a car that he found the car like who can't do that. That's what he said to the person type

172
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
 Yeah, who can't do that?

173
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,640
 Wait, who can't do that? He did not start going through

174
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,360
 Individual aspects of your show. He sure did Jacob. He sure did to the customer service rep. Yes

175
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,120
 Who was not asking for any details whatsoever? She was typing. She was like, hey

176
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,480
 Okay, what do you need? Let's go. Let me see if I can do it. Yes, and so there's she was not asking for details

177
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,980
 So it was clear that he had like rehearsed this in his head, right? Oh

178
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,680
 He was getting out like his speech, you know

179
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
 Yeah

180
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,160
 And so it's warming up by the way

181
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,240
 So that my opening trick that I do in the smaller environments is I have someone look at an envelope. I put it in my pocket

182
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,180
 They take a card they sign it. I

183
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,360
 say I

184
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,040
 Haven't put in the back of the deck. I put it slide it in the back of the deck to shuffle it

185
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,720
 And I say where's the envelope and they go in your pocket and I reach my pocket all the cards are in my pocket

186
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 then they literally look back to my left hand which was previously holding all the cards and it's holding an envelope and

187
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,960
 Inside the envelope is their card and it is signed by them. Okay, anybody can do that

188
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,520
 Anybody can do that. Anyone can do that. So I was offended at his description of my opening

189
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,320
 You should be

190
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,720
 You're right to be offended by that gave him a piece of my mind. Now. Look, you know, I'm a human

191
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,400
 I'm a self-conscious human, you know, I'm a thing. I'm a we've established on this podcast. I'm a thin-skinned human. I

192
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,520
 Do not don't be me to Matt. He'll be up. It'll upset it

193
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,400
 So at first I really think to like hide

194
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,940
 Like I literally go like oh my god, like how embarrassing like I literally almost pull my hat like over my head

195
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:53,360
 Are you you're still in line at this point or you're a different desk, okay, right you're in line

196
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,880
 But he is but he's being serviced by the customer service people. That's right

197
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,000
 Okay, and if you were across the room, I wouldn't hurt it. And if I don't like my key of my door

198
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I would never know

199
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,980
 Then I'm called I have something to say about the magic show quote-unquote that I watched

200
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,840
 And I am

201
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,140
 You know

202
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,820
 Did you put your headphones back in surreptitiously

203
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,840
 No, I really had a voice go off in my head. That was like as if like I was parenting myself

204
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,480
 I literally go like don't you dare don't you dare and I do not interact no

205
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,400
 No, but I was like don't hide like I was like, okay

206
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,240
 I literally got self-conscious put my head over my head and the voice went on my head was like no

207
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,400
 Fuck him, right?

208
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,560
 And so I went full like I like total split personality would full aggro then I put my head back and I started standing tall

209
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
 And I started staring at him. Oh

210
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,680
 Okay, but you haven't spoken to him. I haven't spoken to him and then he complains about a second trick

211
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 Oh boy

212
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,660
 He's gonna go through the whole routine he's got notes I did 26 shows

213
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,440
 uh-huh and

214
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,100
 25 of them every trick went amazing. Oh

215
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,080
 buddy 26 shows I did six effects on his show

216
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,360
 One trick went wrong

217
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,540
 Okay, and it was my ring trick and it was like not to be too magic about it

218
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,400
 but I and I performed this trick a lot and

219
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,840
 There was a design factor in this ring that I did not understand and therefore

220
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,580
 The magic effect did not work and I authentically lost their ring and a sea of rings

221
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,100
 Jar you have like a mason jar of rings, right?

222
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,000
 And I pull the ring out of a pile of rings and it's their ring on a string

223
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,560
 Yeah, and due to a certain design of the ring the ring did not come up with the string

224
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 and

225
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:09,080
 Good and as reminded of what Penn says about magic, which is when metrics go wrong boys is just a waste of everyone's time and

226
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,640
 And now I feel

227
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,720
 Less emboldened as an ogre staring him down because now he's calling you out on an actual

228
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
 He has a point very rarely

229
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,560
 Our magicians held to account

230
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,440
 Strictly by the success of their tricks and yet here I am

231
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,400
 Costing this company money

232
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,640
 For failing to do my job. Are they refunding his money? They are

233
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,120
 That they are they are funding his drinks there. Let's make this loud man happy enough that he will go away

234
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,040
 They're refunding it before he was giving any details

235
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,160
 They didn't care or want the details didn't even care why he didn't like spell them

236
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,960
 They just said I did not enjoy spelling. I went off

237
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,000
 They said okay, and then while she was trying to work it out on her computer. He just started rallying it off

238
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,400
 Yeah, yeah, he slowed her down telling her the things that were wrong with him

239
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,080
 So then I get called to my customer service desk and it's the one right next to him

240
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
 I don't get called across the room. I get called

241
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,180
 This makes me so happy and that's that was Penn's response that's exactly that's all pended

242
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,840
 Pentecost laughs and said this is great

243
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 He's right, he's right, that's right

244
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:45,640
 And now I'm sitting next to him and I basically I'm like now I'm like like ready to give the sup chin to him

245
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,680
 Cuz like yes, it's me. Whatever

246
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,040
 Now I'm dressed to go to the gym. I'm basically dressed the way I'm dressed

247
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
 I'm basically dressed the way I am now

248
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:07,120
 And so I am in like, you know t-shirt or my my my flat cap I got headphones around my neck and I'm in

249
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
 you know, you know sweatpants and

250
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,640
 He just doesn't recognize me straight up just looks

251
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,640
 Just looks at me and goes no and I'm staring at him right like a little angrily staring at him

252
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
 I'm making eyes with him

253
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,720
 He he doesn't realize this but he's already been having a conversation with you

254
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,560
 he interprets my staring eyes as

255
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,880
 Boy, doesn't it suck to be stuck in customer service right now

256
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,880
 So I give him a glare and he looks at me sees my glare and puts his hand on my shoulder and says

257
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,240
 We'll get through this

258
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
 More

259
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,400
 And the multiple levels that will get through this is working on my brain I

260
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,800
 Like scob smacked I am speechless. I am spinning

261
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:16,520
 This is wild that's fucking wild this is the most magical thing that happened on that cruise

262
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
 It was like I am so

263
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,940
 I want to tell no one right like this is so embarrassing. I don't know if I could tell my wife about this

264
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,360
 Right

265
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,920
 And then I'm like and then I literally have to go to the 19th deck and take a walk. That's what I do

266
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,620
 I literally go like I got the harpooners run stand by

267
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,400
 Man the harpoons this guy looks like a jumper

268
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,680
 I like all the woulda coulda shoulda's and everything else and then all sudden going like but you did fuck up your trick

269
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:02,800
 And I was really spinning and then I was like, oh, huh, I'm gonna tell Penn and Penn

270
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,560
 Tell Penn Sunday schools. Yeah, I can tell nobody I can tell, you know 20,000 people and

271
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,660
 And then Penn just left his ass off and then I just been processing it but I just was like

272
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,360
 Really? I really ran myself with a ringer for like a good couple hours and I thought I did I

273
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,300
 Was really like I'm quitting magic

274
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:32,080
 This is behind the curtain right here

275
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,340
 This is more behind the curtain than we usually go when Matt messes up like a patreon post or something. He beats himself up

276
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,560
 Matt does not like making mistakes on things, especially ones that he could have avoided

277
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,480
 You know the fact that this guy is being an asshole and like in your mind you're like, oh this fucking jerk

278
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,340
 He's being a he's being a jerk and he's being a jerk about my thing and that sucks and man

279
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,640
 This guy's really being a jerk shit. He said something that's correct. I I did mess that up

280
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,800
 And he is just he is correct. I don't have a firm fuck that guy

281
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 I'm great at telling someone else fuck that guy, right?

282
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,360
 Someone else right should be like this guy did this to me. I'm great at like getting in my friends faces and be like

283
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,860
 Hey, fuck that guy, you know and really getting the person to like really shed it, you know, yeah, it does not work on me

284
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
 I cannot do it

285
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:30,560
 Can't do it. I'm the child of a public defender. I literally like, you know, it's like oh my god that murder my brain goes

286
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,400
 Well, it came from somewhere. What was his childhood? Like who did what he do? You know, like I this is what I grew up

287
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,380
 Seeing the three-dimensionality of life's horrors through the New Jersey criminal justice system

288
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,880
 I always try to give someone credit even if they're being full dickheads to me, right?

289
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,220
 Oh if I can take a part of it as blame, I will shovel that blame onto my own shoulders

290
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:00,240
 Speaking of taking blame. I don't think we discussed how how did the rest of the ring trick go after the mechanism didn't work?

291
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,560
 Great question

292
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,000
 What is the solution there I literally have to go in front of the audience and peel through all the rings to

293
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,440
 And find it and return it to them

294
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,700
 Oh

295
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,320
 so you don't just like take the table off stage and hand it to a stage hand like with the couple and be like

296
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,080
 Help these people find their ring. I can't I have no stage hands on spellbound on my regular

297
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,600
 If I was on the main stage of her cruise ship I could do exactly what you just said

298
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,360
 But yeah, it's spelled like here's the couple whose ring I just lost please find the ring for them and send them back to their

299
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,520
 See, I really only have one question Matt. Yes. I really have one question

300
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,800
 After you have to scatter the rings out and go through them bit by bit

301
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:53,220
 Yeah, and slowly but surely disseminate the junk rings and find the one when you do finally find it

302
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,160
 Do you at least give a tada?

303
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,800
 Did you do a flourish when you found it I know don't do that Paul I don't do that

304
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,760
 I'm gonna say missed opportunity missed opportunity. Yes. I it's funny

305
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,840
 I I think it's cuz I you know came up through Penn and Teller Penn and Teller don't have

306
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:24,240
 Women we're relaunching the show and we were working with Jeff McBride and Jeff McBride was you know is a famous magician his own

307
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,120
 Right a huge huge magician runs a magic school here in Las Vegas

308
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,840
 The most famous one of the most famous magic schools in the world

309
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,640
 Jacob no Paul rather

310
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,640
 This I don't think I could be more accurate this metaphor even though this will go over most of the audience's head

311
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,120
 He is the Sharna Halpern of magic

312
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,740
 Yeah, yeah Jeff is yes

313
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:52,020
 Jeff McBride is yeah one-on-one ratio Sharna Halpern rain improv olympic and all the things that okay bitch about Sharna about people bitch

314
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,960
 About Jeff about and all the power that trying to had Jeff has

315
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
 great

316
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,520
 But he he he was hired as a consultant to help relaunch the show post-pandemic and I was in the room with him and

317
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,480
 At one point they were doing it going over a trick and

318
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,560
 Jeff McBride goes well, what's your out on that? And this is an out is like magicians basically like what's your thing?

319
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,560
 If you miss it you go back and you get it later. Uh-huh when something fucks up. What's your what you're out?

320
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,400
 Yeah, and they both turned to Jeff and go like we don't have outs

321
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,120
 And he goes what do you mean you don't have you don't have it out for this he goes no, we don't have outs

322
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,680
 We don't use outs

323
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,440
 Because you live outside any tricks and they go no

324
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,520
 It works or it doesn't they go. What do you think? Oh, we just move along

325
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,360
 Right and this made Jeff laughs like so hard

326
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,980
 He's like, what do you think you don't have outs and I was laughing I go, you know, it's funny Jeff

327
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,980
 I haven't worked with them there for years. They don't

328
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,360
 And the teller don't use outs

329
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,320
 Just go like that didn't work

330
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
 Next and so

331
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,920
 I

332
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,480
 Comedically point out how much authentic sweat was piling up with my forehead as I

333
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:07,140
 Went through the rings in a jar until I found their ring and then said I could try to do something magical

334
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,120
 Here to try to make this an out and make this not a mistake

335
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,200
 But I think just funny to let you guys know that I made a mistake and we're moving on and I got a big laugh

336
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,000
 And then I finished the show strong with two more effects

337
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,860
 And so I thought I had recovered the show as a whole beautifully

338
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,120
 Well, and I think was proof of your audience

339
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:34,000
 That's because you have not heard about the people that were in line behind Matt the rest of the crowd was in line behind Matt

340
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,680
 You can't like they also didn't recognize him, but they had things to say. Nah, you can't make all everybody happy

341
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,920
 It's just what it is. Oh, man. No, it's on the same ship. We were doing

342
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,000
 I didn't end up doing a show for two people and it was so awkward. So the next group that came my show for two people

343
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,420
 I said listen, you're doing shows at the you're doing tricks at the bar. I go. Let me just switch off with you at the bar

344
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,400
 We'll just do all of our tricks here. Yeah, they go great

345
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,720
 And so we he and I entertained two people and two people left over at the bar going back and forth doing tricks and end up

346
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,340
 Getting really kind of energy in there is really fun. And I love also knows like man. I love doing magic by the bar

347
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,720
 This is really fun. Yeah, those people complain. They didn't get the theatrical experience and got money

348
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,760
 Fuckers

349
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,440
 They got the intimate special one-of-a-kind thing and they're like I didn't like that

350
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,880
 It's just cuz they can this cruise ships. I'll say this is cruise ship

351
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,920
 This is this is that is that is these are the people that are on the cruise ship

352
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,740
 Already that I like that's the thing is you you are just this is gonna sound like I'm being mean to you, but I'm not

353
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,080
 This is the thing where you are just in their mind one of the things that's like a box that they can tick

354
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,580
 They're like, yeah, I think I get my money back on that one. I'm pretty sure I get my money back on there

355
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:52,000
 Like oh, I got I ate at this restaurant. It's a little more than eating the buffet, but you know, the steak was overcooked

356
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,600
 So I'm gonna go ahead and get my money back on that man

357
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,400
 I never had to go through hearing or seeing any kind of critique on my

358
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,880
 Stuff it shows when we were doing well

359
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,680
 Again so again because I'm part of this boutique experience right through the Magic Castle. It's not a regular thing

360
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,480
 So on a regular ship, I am ushered on through the entertainment, you know greeted by the you know, the the the entertainment director

361
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,280
 I am handled with my you know tech and all the run-throughs and all this other stuff and I will never hear anything on those ships

362
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,040
 So the regular ships that I do this is a premium

363
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:33,320
 Experience. Yes, it's the only thing that people could pay for an extra cost. Yes, and therefore they cop people who that makes a fucking difference

364
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:40,520
 They know that kind of stuff. Oh, sure. Yeah, and so you deal with all kinds of and I didn't even think about you still get casino

365
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,240
 comps on the ocean you can't get away from get the casino comps and

366
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,480
 Once my first day once I'm ushered under the ship

367
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,560
 that's the last time I see an entertainment director until the end of the ship from then on I am under the

368
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,320
 jurisdiction of the restaurant manager and catering oh

369
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:05,200
 Yes, and those people are not an entertainment and so they know they tell you things very plainly the way no entertainment director ever would

370
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,760
 So that's how I found out about the theater experience thing

371
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,000
 And I

372
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,400
 Like an entertainment director an agent nobody else nobody in the entertainment world is telling you about that at all

373
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,720
 No, and even what time I end up not not without a lot of sugar

374
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,520
 I did not not do one of my five shows when I supposed to because I was told

375
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,160
 By someone else that it was not gonna be for like another half hour

376
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,200
 So I went okay

377
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,620
 I went I left the theater and I got yelled at yell that like I was

378
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,080
 Like a like a bartender like like working for them

379
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,240
 And I literally was like looking at them like what I'm like I why are you you cannot yell at me?

380
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,640
 It's like why are you yelling at me and right? I?

381
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,040
 Was like I said I said I said just as you know I wait till it calm down

382
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 I gave it a beat I did my show I went back to them, and I said just so you know I

383
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,080
 Never leave the room unless it's set for a show so the moment you want to show you can have it

384
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,440
 I said all I've done this entire week is say yes

385
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
 I've never said no to a single thing so you tell me the shows are I'm doing six shows tonight

386
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,880
 I'm doing four shows tonight. I'm doing two shows. I'm doing a show for two people

387
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,380
 I'm doing a show for 30 people all I have said the entire time was yes

388
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,840
 So please don't treat me like I'm some guy sneaking off to like slack and right yeah

389
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,520
 That's not what I'm doing

390
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,940
 I said so you can just shoot me a text saying need you now and you will have a show that starts in a minute

391
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,400
 And I was like that's all you need to know

392
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,420
 And it's just like you can't

393
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,940
 Basically what I couldn't say it was like you can't yell at a performer expect them to be very good at this

394
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,520
 right

395
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,720
 You're lucky you're talking to someone who has an experience bartender and experienced catering waiter and experienced made her day

396
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,520
 Yeah, you've been in that you've been in that world long enough to know what it is, but boy

397
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,040
 Somebody who's gone through enough therapy to not like scream back at her

398
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,880
 She's yelling at you in the first place right yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Lindsay Beshear is right

399
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 I said I was a waiter and I cried

400
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:15,320
 Tears from the eyes, but I was like and this is all you know and this is it's it's just a strange thing

401
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,480
 It's a strange gig that I looked into it's a weird bit right and the strange bit is is it pays slightly better than?

402
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,840
 The then if I was a main stage performer performing for all thousand people at the same time in the theater right doing two shows

403
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,280
 in a cruise

404
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,940
 What I'm doing because I'm working seven nights a week and doing three or four sets a night actually pays better

405
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,920
 So even though this is shittier, and it's less glorious

406
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,440
 And I don't feel like an entertainer as much as I feel like high-end bartender waiter

407
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,560
 Okay, it's still worth it to do it for my family to do to do the experience. Yeah, man

408
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,960
 I mean at least you feel like a high-end bartender. It's true. I'm gonna talk to you

409
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,680
 Could be a low-end bartender

410
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,480
 I'll tell you who loves a good low-end bartender and by that I mean bartending on their ends and that's the following sponsor

411
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,140

 Sorry, I brought the jokers of magic dates and then where did it go? Oh, here we go

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,320
 That's right. Today's show is brought to you by Brian brushwood and Justin Robert Young's greatest hits album volume two

415
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,700
 Hey, everybody, it's Brian. Hey, I'm here with the

416
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,240
 scams cool

417
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,540
 Look, I know I know what you want. I know what you want to trick your friends. You want to trick your neighbors?

418
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,360
 You want to trick your kids? Well, you can't

419
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:45,760
 I'm about to show you a secret. This is a deep dark secret

420
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:54,060
 Picture it 1958 a young American sailor just got done

421
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 Near Cambodia

422
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,260
 He decides that he's gonna go for a swim. Yeah

423
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,560
 so he puts on some fins a

424
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,440
 snorkel mask and dives

425
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,560
 dives just outside of one of the Cambodian Islands as

426
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,520
 Deep as he can go with a single breath

427
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,440
 while he's down there in the ocean depths he comes upon a

428
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,960
 mollusk

429
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,160
 Inside this mollusk. He later discovers a pearl a

430
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,760
 Perfect pearl or what he assumes to be a perfect pearl

431
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,000
 So he takes that pearl out of the mollusk and

432
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,200
 Thinks on it. He's looking at this beautiful gem that was created inside the gut of this squiggly little animal

433
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,720
 That lives inside of a collapsed shell

434
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,800
 he thinks to himself I

435
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
 Bet if I made a bunch of these I

436
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,960
 Could really make a business

437
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,880
 Sure enough

438
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,440
 He looks into the deed for that area of beach and it just happens to be for sale

439
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,840
 And the price of that beach happens to be almost exactly

440
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,280
 His four months furlough salary that he was receiving from a GI bill

441
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,640
 So he decides to take a risk. He buys that small piece of beach off of Cambodia

442
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,000
 and he starts seeding all of these

443
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,200
 mollusks all around this seabed and

444
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,080
 creating pearls and

445
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,720
 He turns this into a business

446
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,580
 It takes a couple of months for the pearls to be created

447
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,000
 He brings them up

448
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,640
 takes the pearl

449
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,000
 Puts many of them right back into the water. They keep breeding

450
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,720
 He's making conditions down there that are very affable to how they live. He feeds these mollusks

451
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,480
 He's got a real farm going

452
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,120
 It's incredible

453
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:09,520
 By 1963 he has an empire built on this small island

454
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,880
 He's the king. He's ruling this place with his trade in pearls

455
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,520
 He can't believe his luck. How

456
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,960
 lucky can you get the pearl magnate of

457
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,240
 South Cambodia this guy he's got everything he needs

458
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:34,560
 But then he finds one of these mollusks

459
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,020
 Has left its normal shell and gone into a very fancy spiral one

460
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,440
 He crafts the spiral shell

461
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,600
 and he looks inside and

462
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,180
 He pulls out the mollusks that he's seeded and sure enough

463
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,520
 There's a pearl in there more perfect than any other pearl

464
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,560
 he keeps this shell and he keeps reseeding it over and over again and

465
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,640
 That shell

466
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,000
 Becomes the new holy grail for his enterprise

467
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,440
 he can't get better pearls than what he finds in this shell and

468
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,880
 that's because

469
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,520
 This man after six years of farming pearls has found

470
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,360
 the world's

471
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,480
 greatest conch

472
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:42,680
 I am so mad for so many reasons

473
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
 I

474
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:53,440
 Don't care what you do

475
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:03,000
 Nick in the chat says I'm mad at myself for invested. I wasn't this I honestly didn't even know where it was going for a long time

476
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,520
 Oh, you really I thought I was gonna make a pearl necklace joke for a minute and then I finally went

477
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,240
 Oh, yeah, world's greatest. No world's greatest conch. Yeah

478
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,560
 That's funny Matt and I both knew you were going there before you did yeah

479
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,760
 That was a true cliff-diver

480
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,960
 Thank you, Leon

481
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,620
 Don't fool us because we're stupid cunks fools because we're human

482
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:34,700
 By the way, they just did a banger of a new episode on the Ponzi scheme. Oh

483
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:41,560
 Yeah, I've got a listen. Oh and world's greatest saving it. Yeah. Oh good. Yeah, he's only got the first episode up, right?

484
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,280
 I mean, I think it's a one. I believe it's just a one-off. Oh, it's just a one-off. Okay, gotcha

485
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,320
 Yeah. Yeah. Oh good. I've got a I've got plane flights this week

486
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,640
 Perfect. I need some good shows

487
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,160
 But yeah

488
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,740
 Yeah, I'm sorry Paul has distracted us from everything that we might have been thinking about

489
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,280
 Being a suffering cruise ship

490
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:16,040
 But when I speak with such glowing enthusiasm for my upcoming jokers of magic gigs you now you really understand why

491
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:22,400
 I've really just I'm so excited to do real shows for real people and real environment away from that that structure

492
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,040
 Yeah, that's a hard structure and cruise ships are they can be a nightmare

493
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,560
 Their own this is their own world there's just a strange that's there on the world. Yeah, I don't I don't begrudge it

494
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,980
 I don't I think I think it keeps a lot of people employed in a lot of levels a lot of brother. I did for me

495
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,760
 Yeah, I know I had a conversation this week with an old friend of mine who works for Royal Caribbean

496
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,600
 and and that's what he was saying he was because he's kind of the

497
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:53,440
 When new cast members and new entertainers are coming in he's the one that's dealing with a lot of these these new people and

498
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,280
 He's like yeah

499
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,440
 The first two three weeks is just me telling them to trust me that it's all gonna work out this way

500
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,980
 It's all a dumb system that they don't understand yet, but eventually they'll understand the dumb system and it'll be fine

501
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:13,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and yeah, it's just like it's this whole different thing. That's not like anything else in especially not an entertainment

502
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,180
 Yeah, it's it's you know

503
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,760
 And so actually when I'm talking about with with Penn is that like?

504
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:28,280
 For other things it makes a lot of sense, but in entertainment you are actually already you already speak a currency of immediate gratification, right?

505
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,160
 you showed up in the theater you laugh you applaud you leave with a smile on your face or

506
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,400
 Or those things don't happen you very much understand that those things didn't happen and you need to make adjustments, right?

507
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,680
 You need to figure things out

508
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,800
 So you don't need this additional

509
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,780
 Threat of a future feedback loop that's going to hurt your reputation down the line

510
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,400
 As you talk from one person to another I don't know

511
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,240
 I mean you thought the rest of the show went really well is what you said

512
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
 It sounds like you might have needed this extra feedback. I don't know

513
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,360
 Maybe he just didn't think you look you looked ashamed of yourself enough by the end of the show

514
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:12,080
 Jessica Jane Peterson has been doing the the Lord's work. She's trying to get me on booked on Disney Cruises, right?

515
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
 That's that's her goal. Okay, is to get me booked

516
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,880
 Disney and

517
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,640
 My we have the same agent and

518
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,800
 So an opportunity came up at at Disney

519
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,840
 He knew that there was a goal and he fired off my stuff to Disney and he fired off my usual stuff

520
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:39,800
 Just sent them what he sends everyone. Yeah, is not what you want to do to sell stuff to Disney Disney now

521
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,040
 and so

522
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,840
 And so I got

523
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,120
 Rejected I got I got no it does not seem like he is he is gonna be a good fit on the ship

524
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,720
 What's that opening monologue you do about all of your experiences at Disney parks that I think really might have turned him off

525
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:05,200
 That one experience oh you guys like Disney do you

526
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:20,920
 This is this is way before Splash Mountain this is more like Trash Mountain

527
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,680
 And so

528
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,280
 You know like I I was like they said the feedback and I was like, oh well if you set them my usual tape

529
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
 Then yeah, I agree with that

530
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:40,440
 You had a you had a different thing ready to go I don't know I did a cleaner show

531
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,040
 With children in the theater

532
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,720
 At Dickens in Delaware that I had an hour-long tape of that wasn't 45

533
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,360
 But it was certainly more now. I still did my straightest jacket escape

534
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,920
 Which is which is one of their notes of like you could not cannot do that off, right?

535
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,600
 Okay, well then fuck them

536
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,720
 You know one word for them anyway

537
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,320
 But if you did

538
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:10,440
 My suggestion going forward Matt would that would be that you adopt a fursona?

539
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,880
 Ah, I would say I heard fursona and the answer is yes, okay

540
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,700
 Sona I see Jessica Jane, you know, and she's able to very quickly just

541
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,240
 slide into

542
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,320
 Disney Princess mode you need to go full sully and

543
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,880
 You need a full furry outfit

544
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,880
 Head to toe listening go on and and that needs to be the character that you create for these various

545
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:52,220
 Particular child-friendly Disney s gigs you need a persona magic routine. Why would Matt dressing up as a commercial airline pilot?

546
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,120
 Excite these children

547
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:02,280
 No, why would they care about that at all monsters already sullys that I landed a plane at a river

548
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,600
 Yeah, yeah, I know but a love to do magic as sully. I would love to do it

549
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,120
 I would do that so fast as sully that the be really funny to do it as the airline pilot

550
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
 Here of the Hudson. Yeah

551
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,760
 The magic of sully sullenberger, I go to do a levitation and a bird strike hits

552
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:33,520
 Hudson this child will be in the Hudson and I was gonna land this

553
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,120
 Routine in the Hudson, but yeah, I think you could do you could do a full

554
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,840
 You know and you could talk with you could talk with Harry

555
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:49,560
 The guerrilla addition because he's got experience with that. He's basically taken on a for magic. So, you know, I

556
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,000
 Didn't watch a recent

557
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,280
 Paul I don't know if you've been keeping up with fool us, but I watched a recent fool us episode and

558
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:03,120
 There was a fella on there that I laughed really hard at his routine before I realized what was happening

559
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,820
 He does like like film work and stuff and he came out and did a very interesting avant-garde

560
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,040
 Magic routine was this the body man? Yes. Yes boy that routine

561
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,160
 I was sitting there looking at it going like how the fuck does this guy travel a buffalo head?

562
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,460
 And then I realized that he just doesn't that this was a one-off thing

563
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:28,620
 That was the strangest thing we had ever done unfool us. Yep, and

564
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,420
 When it was over we had no better explanation

565
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:38,560
 Penn and teller didn't know like how to even bust what they were watching, right?

566
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
 I don't think you fooled us

567
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,600
 Also, I don't know what you just did cool

568
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,040
 There was some interactive like film to life elements, which I guess qualify as illusion

569
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,760
 There was there was this whole thing where part of it relied on Brooke going in and out of the film

570
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she was a character

571
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:07,960
 yes, and they didn't have very interesting the outfit that she needed to go in and out to make it really believable and

572
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,000
 Seamless or at least a little more seamless

573
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,800
 It was close, but I we ended up doing a bowl was there

574
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,360
 We end up doing like heavy lifting by we I mean the production team the production team did a lot of work to get that

575
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
 Thing to get to get that to where it was

576
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:32,820
 They ran through it at least four at least three times so there's a lot and and then the ending I like four times

577
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,320
 That was everyone in the audience feel like they were just tripping balls. Yeah. No, that was just it. Everybody was like what the fuck is going on

578
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,580
 I mean, I just watched it on TV and I was still tripping but nobody hated it

579
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,160
 It was it was interesting enough that everybody was still polite and chill with it

580
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:56,520
 So, you know, that's what the guy after Matt in line said to his customer service representative about Matt show. Mm-hmm

581
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,760
 I hated it. Hey, everybody's polite enough

582
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,040
 Head was interesting. I wish I was wearing a big buffalo head while I was sitting in customer service

583
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,320
 This is what I'm telling you Matt you get you need a second for Sona

584
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,360
 So that when things go south on the ship, you can just put on a mask and fuck all these fools

585
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,040
 Yeah, I don't know. I'm just Sully. I

586
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,320
 Have to come up with a unique character

587
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,240
 Sully Sullenberger the

588
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,120
 Magic performing airplane pilot is pretty good character kind of ridiculous actually

589
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,320
 Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, so I'll try the Sullenberger thing

590
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,080
 I did I did think of well, it's not about moving the baseball cards to Marvel characters, which I think that would work

591
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,080
 right, right and

592
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,320
 You know

593
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,400
 JJ, of course is still like no we can figure it out

594
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,120
 We just have to you know, whatever and I'm just like I don't know if this is worth chasing

595
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:56,280
 Well, did you just hear yesterday's big announcement from them know how they're doubling down with AI

596
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,540
 Who I don't even know what them you're talking about Disney, okay, it's really it's fucking weird

597
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,320
 Because they had a lawsuit pending

598
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,180
 Against a lot of these AI companies

599
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:20,240
 Where they were they were winning in court a lot of times about misuse of their and misappropriation of their characters

600
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:28,080
 And they have turned on a fucking dime and not only have they decided to allow these companies full access to their characters

601
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,600
 But they are making investments in the millions and billions of dollars into said companies

602
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:39,440
 So yeah, I mean this somebody got in somebody's bossy bossy just put one up in the chat here

603
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,120
 It says Disney you got about a one billion dollar investment with a B with open AI

604
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,960
 It's bring hundreds of Disney characters to its generative AI platforms, right?

605
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:57,040
 So that is a that is a shift that is a policy shift over a huge shift a huge shift and it's not it doesn't bode

606
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,920
 Well, but it's also just one more thing where we're just propping up this bullshit that doesn't do anything

607
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,920
 Except let Sully fuck Mike Wazowski in the ass, you know, like oh great

608
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:17,740
 Yeah, yeah, how fun I get to watch Cinderella and it's so she's like Pixar has always had like a

609
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,640
 Not even a hand in relationship with Disney, you know

610
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,680
 Yeah, and Pixar just announced or do they decide to go the other way and they went back to doing a hand-drawn animation

611
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,960
 The next the next the next movie coming out Sandra on and I think they're right to do it

612
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,800
 like I

613
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,960
 Here's here's the thing. Is that like?

614
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,600
 In terms of like not trying to be doom and goomba AI but also not liking some of the things I'm seeing I

615
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,680
 Came up with a metaphor

616
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,200
 For myself were like I consider it like cooking

617
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,640
 Okay, like I figured out how to cook everything by machine and in our lives

618
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,280
 We see things that are by cooked by machine and we don't pay a lot for it and we don't care that much about it

619
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,460
 Right. So we get fast food burgers from from you know

620
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,880
 There's places and then it has not stopped us from craving better burgers

621
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,540
 And then we've only turned around and respected people who are doing things more bespoke to make food taste good

622
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:22,080
 So we we regularly pay people to do the expert things that at a level that we just simply don't want for machines

623
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:29,120
 Right and bespoke nachos are the superior nachos. Oh, man a way to kick with torpedo my point Jacob

624
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:37,840
 No, no, but I mean this is like I think like yes great all these people are gonna be allowed to make all of their own

625
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,440
 Disney movies and all that's gonna make us do is not give a shit or want to pay for those things

626
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,200
 Yeah, not pay good money for those things

627
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,060
 We might still consume it like we do all consume fast food

628
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:56,440
 But we won't sit around raving about how we need to pay good money for this shit. It's clearly going to become

629
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:05,680
 overall a devaluation of all of it, but I don't they're not I don't think they see that yet and I don't know I

630
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,440
 Don't know that it matters. There's also

631
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,340
 Part of me and this is real. There's a part of me that's thinking like maybe it needs to be devalued a little bit

632
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:21,680
 Absolutely. Well, the whole thing is just strange. Anyway, it has gotten away from itself, but

633
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,080
 Yeah, the descendant of Walt Disney's always speaking up at shareholders meetings

634
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:31,840
 Talking about how they'd be more generous and how they're portraying all these other things. It's it's it's a weird time

635
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,680
 Yeah

636
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:40,140
 Because all these things only in only in regards to Disney though. Everything else is going smoothly but for Disney

637
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,240
 It's an odd time in history right now, but that was a very freaky turnabout

638
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,000
 from a huge creative company and I think you're okay for not

639
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,160
 Being accepted by a company whose standards are clearly in limbo right now

640
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,020
 Yeah, I mean look I have you know over the years where I almost got a job at ESPN and ESPN was bought by

641
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,880
 Disney or I write my you know, my kids go to Disneyland for free because my

642
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,520
 Mother-in-law's a retired employee

643
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,280
 You know

644
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,360
 Don't get me wrong. I do a lot of back-and-forth at this about my relationship to the Disney as a company and investment

645
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,360
 I mean, I have we all do

646
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,160
 My Toy Story stuff down there and you know, yeah

647
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,320
 Yeah, I mean I loved Aladdin and Little Mermaid and Lion King. Although that was very formative stuff

648
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:35,060
 Oh, we used to go to Disneyland Park, but we'd go there like 10 11 12 times a year easily

649
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,240
 We just pop over there and just do a day and it's incredible

650
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,920
 Yeah, you know like that that experience in those parks is incredible, right? It's expensive and incredible

651
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,320
 That's the thing is now. It's now it's fucking expensive

652
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:55,440
 Expensive now. It's like holy shit. What are you guys doing prohibitive? Yeah, we go, you know for for free and it's expensive

653
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,360
 Yeah, like like just just they make you add on all the stuff that pay for all the extra extra stuff

654
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,240
 You don't just want like dinner. Yeah

655
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:14,360
 But I'm saying like this is this this is what this is what's gonna happen with AI is it's just right make it's just gonna make

656
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,940
 The the waters muddier and it's gonna make real creators stand out and because it's gonna be a relief

657
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,720
 More than just it's difficult. I'm sure you guys are doing the same thing like like scrolling on YouTube or on any social media thing

658
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:36,320
 I'm in there or whatever. Oh, it's so crazy just in this last couple of weeks there every every videos like it seems like

659
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:42,160
 The majority of the videos that are coming through now are AI something. Yeah, and and if we weren't

660
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,080
 media savvy

661
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:51,120
 We won't even be questioning it. Well, like I saw one the other day that was you know, some some left-leaning

662
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,480
 Political organization put out a photo of Trump with the with the wind blowing his hair in a certain way

663
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,020
 That made it look like he was completely bald and had a big comb over now

664
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,960
 Donald Trump has famously has hair that looks like cotton candy made of piss

665
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,040
 I'm not defending Donald Trump's hair, but I looked at this picture for about half a second was like this is photoshopped

666
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,160
 Somebody is somebody's Photoshop this picture to make him to make him look worse than he does

667
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,640
 Also, why waste your fucking time making Donald Trump look worse than he actually looks you don't need to

668
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:28,200
 It's but like yeah, what are you doing? And I see that I go instantly we go like well, that's fake moving on

669
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:36,120
 But not everybody thing the scary thing is like you've got like videos of of people falling over and dropping shit and then you go

670
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,620
 Oh, okay. They've got an extra arm or or oh that that little piece came out of nowhere

671
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:49,200
 But it won't be long before you can't discern no and that's the dangerous thing is that they're gonna use it as a propaganda tool

672
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:56,800
 that's why they're pushing it so hard is to try and get it to better itself to the point where you can't discern truth from fiction and

673
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,000
 then and then

674
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,880
 Like I saw I've seen I've seen good damn bands on this so people are selling online

675
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:12,680
 You can do the print model of a ring that you put it on your hand and it's an extra finger, right? Oh

676
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:19,440
 So it's great. You make sure you wear that if you're going to protests or if you're gonna be in any kind of compromising

677
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,600
 Situation or just wear it day to day and any photos taken of you you can then point to that and go

678
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,600
 It's clearly AI

679
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,680
 There's an extra. This is an extra digit. Oh

680
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:38,680
 I love using analog technology to defeat the the AI technology, but that's also like if you're a murderer

681
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,000
 You're gonna start wearing extra fingers

682
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,280
 Listen murderers have been ahead of technology's curve for many years. I guess you're right, but jeez, it's scary

683
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:56,680
 I'll tell you who else has been ahead of murderers for a long time. Maybe not long enough. We'll see that's the following sponsor

684
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,440
 Today's show is brought to you by

685
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:06,580

 Hey, how's it going everybody? I'm so glad you joined me

687
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,160
 Let's go ahead and pour ourselves a small glass of chamomile and bring it down to zero

688
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,760
 Yeah, all the way down to zero. That's what I'm talking about calm

689
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:30,160
 Relax yourselves. Okay, let the tension flow out of your body

690
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,080
 All the way down to your toes

691
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:40,800
 Oh, yeah, and then let it slip out through your shoes and end of the carpet where it goes away and dissipates completely

692
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,680
 I want you to clear your mind clear your mind

693
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,320
 And think about all the little stars in the sky

694
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:56,320
 All the little twinkling lights imagine that you're in a you're in a field and you're laying in the grass

695
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:04,760
 Look good up at the sky and you see in the stars. Oh, yeah, just stars everywhere you can look

696
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,360
 There's no stars are twinkling you focus on one

697
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,040
 star one star

698
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,280
 That you can see

699
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,400
 It starts to get bigger and it's bigger and it's glowing and you are getting closer to that star

700
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,760
 Closer to that star and it's getting bigger and it's slowly absorbing you

701
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,640
 Becoming one with that star you are that star now

702
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:39,560
 Yeah, you and this star the same thing. No difference. We're all made of star stuff

703
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:47,320
 Even miss Elizabeth made a star stuff. We're all the same. There's no separation. There's no me. There's no you there's just us

704
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,660
 We're all connected in this big crazy world

705
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,520
 And we're all here just for a cup of coffee on the planet Earth and then poop we zip out of existence

706
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:05,240
 Real fast, huh? Oh, yeah, what happened? What we do? Who do we help? That's all that matters

707
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:10,760
 Who did we love? I loved miss Elizabeth and cocaine. That was all

708
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,280
 For the benefit of you you the people I tell you who I didn't love

709
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,280
 Hogan fuck that guy

710
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
 And

711
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:33,520
 Don't be specifically great meditation very peaceable. Okay. Yeah, take it to zero. Okay

712
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,000
 Let's do a little joke versus nerd where Paul score is gonna be zero

713
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600
 Oh

714
00:58:53,600 --> 00:59:09,600
 We got a scooper to come to us today from winter scoop

715
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:15,240
 I'm sorry, not a scooper t a handmade jock versus nerd scoop categories

716
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,880
 Scopagories is the name of this game Jacob is the game master

717
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:26,520
 There will be six rounds the master will read one word or phrase at a time the player who buzzes in first gets to guess

718
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:33,800
 What the category? Oh what category all the words connect to it. So I'm gonna give you a word or a phrase

719
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:41,140
 Read read some words phrases one one word at a time and you're gonna tell me what the category is if they get it wrong

720
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,240
 The other player gets a free guess before the next one is read

721
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,840
 It gets easier the more that are read if nobody guesses it correctly Jacob gets to make fun of you for as long as he

722
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,480
 Sees fit Wow, and as always Jacob wins with a tie. Okay example

723
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:01,400
 What are we example Oh example category

724
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:09,880

729
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,560
 And the last one was Nebraska

730
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,560
 Okay. All right

731
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,360
 All right, I get it. I get it. Okay. All right, so that's the game. So here we go

732
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,800
 Here's the here's the first real one you buzz in when you know it

733
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,880
 Arizona

740
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,120
 Now I'm afraid that's not it either

741
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,940
 Also, that was all the words. So there aren't any more hints to give

742
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,680
 It's states that border, Nevada

743
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,160
 States that border Nevada. It's that nobody gets it correctly

744
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:19,800
 Jacob gets to make fun of you for long or as long as he sees fit you guys suck at naming states that border, Nevada

745
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,360
 Okay, that's it. That's enough. This is true. Next one
