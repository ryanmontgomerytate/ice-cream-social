1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 "She's mighty mighty, letting the shit leak out."

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,200
 "She's a brick shit house, not terribly affected."

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,320
 This is the part of the show where we thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers!

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
 Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers!

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,880
 Our lists are fucked this month, I am sorry, we don't have a new list yet.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
 I don't know why, but it's all fucked up.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,600
 Maybe we'll have one by the time this comes out, who can say?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,840
 Either way though, we're going to thank all of you before this month is over.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,360
 Thank you to all of you Ice Cream Truck Drivers out there.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,400
 Thank you to everybody who supports us over there on Patreon.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,920

00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,640
 That's right, Dead Laszlo, professionals.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
 Bro.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,480
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,880
 Yeah, I'd love to!

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,320
 Great, let's go!

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,440
 Uh, right before we got on air, Paul convinced me of the brick shithouse argument, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,440
 The pause to brick and house.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,440
 It's a brick shithouse!

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
 That's what it's supposed to be.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,440
 It's time for Matt Madinley's Ice Cream Social!

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Madinley!

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly!

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 Also sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy!

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
 We're PreachingFun!

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
 How y'all doing?

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 I'm doing delightful.

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,440
 I just told everybody on stream, I got a boo-boo from mowing my lawn today.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,440
 You hurt yourself mowing?

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 Yeah, I slipped and fell in wet grass, because I was mowing so early to get done by the time the podcast hit.

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,440
 Which I did, I got it all done, which is great.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,440
 We are injured.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
 What happened?

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
 Oh, Matt also has a boo-boo on his elbow!

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,440
 It's mostly healed, mine's from the water slide in Mesa, Arizona.

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
 Oh, brothers in arms here!

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,440
 Is this a Corsican twin kind of thing happening, Matt?

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
 Yes.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
 Is that what this is?

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 Yep, we are Corsican twins.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,440
 I knew it.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 Oh, Country Scoops.

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
 My elbows are fine.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
 A lot of people got elbow boo-boos.

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,440
 They're going for like $7 to $80 a pop elbow boo-boos.

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 I have tried to get, I just want a green one.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
 You want a green one?

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
 If I get a green one, I'll quit.

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,440
 There's an economist, which economist?

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:37,440
 I don't know, who thinks the la boo-boo craze is a sign that we're about to hit like a really nasty economic thing in our world.

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 I concur, and I would say also...

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:50,440
 An economist theorizes that the la boo-boo craze is foreshadowing a really bad financial time.

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
 Canary in a coal mine.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,440
 I know why he said this, but Paul was really quick to chime in that he also knew.

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 So go ahead, Paul.

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 Oh, sorry, Paul, why is this happening?

59
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:10,440
 Well, it coincides with the same thing that's going on within the trading card world, for those of you who play Magic or Pokemon, and have ever tried to even buy the shit.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 But what it does, it correlates to people feeling frustrated that they have little to no buying power, and they're seeing this.

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,440
 It's sort of a gambling kind of thing with the la boo-boos.

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,440
 It's also the possibility of using their money to then resell it and make a little bit more, and that kind of thing.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 And also, it's not that crazy expensive.

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:47,440
 Buying a pack of Pokemon cards is not that crazy expensive, but it's a way to feel like you have some economic ability within you.

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
 Am I hitting the points there pretty close, Matt?

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
 A little bit.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
 I mean, what you're saying makes sense.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,440
 This person simply pointed to what economists have used in the past, what's called the lipstick index.

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
 Have you heard of this?

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 So it's little treat time.

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
 That's it.

72
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
 The little treat thing is exactly it.

73
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 So it's a sign that you can't afford big treats.

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 So usually right before there's an economic downward trend, a nasty one, the prices of higher-end cosmetics go up.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:39,440
 So suddenly people are spending a little bit more to feel better about themselves during the day on lipsticks and other high-end make-ups because they can't afford to get on a plane and go somewhere.

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,440
 They can't afford to go to some exotic spot.

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
 They can't go to some property.

78
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
 They can't buy a new fancy car.

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,440
 This is why I'm glad my wife is in the coffee business.

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,440
 Fancy coffee is the ultimate little treat.

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,440
 Man, Starbucks is definitely just trying to create--

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
 That's their bar and trade.

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
 Yeah, that's the whole thing, man.

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,440
 High-end drinks for women and drive-throughs.

85
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
 That's all that's happening.

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 Every drink has a crazy color or crazy object in it now.

87
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
 But I still like Starbucks.

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 Starbucks is fascinating.

89
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
 There's nothing in Starbucks I love.

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,440
 I don't know if there's any amazing drink there or amazing food there.

91
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
 Well, and I guess it's from a coffee perspective.

92
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,440
 It's a very specific, very-- is bitter the right word?

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
 Super roasted?

94
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,440
 They do a lot of high-roasted, super high-roasted blends.

95
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,440
 And they're the first ones to really over-roast arapaca beans when we were all used to drinking Colombian coffee when they first came on the market, right?

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,440
 And so they torched-- because they gave people a really robust flavor and then charged a lot of money for it.

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 So we associated that taste with money.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 Right.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
 Because they created it.

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
 Yeah.

101
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 Yeah.

102
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 So that's become their signature thing.

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 Some people-- yeah, but some people still like particular blends and things like that from them.

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 So I don't want to besmirch the grudge.

105
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
 No, not at all.

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 Famously, I described when I was a barista, every coffee profile is burnt and gotten troubled by my manager who's training me.

107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
 It tastes burnt.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 You mean when you were doing your sample tasting as you're onboarding kind of thing?

109
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
 Yeah.

110
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 I'm getting notes of charred grill and whopper.

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 That's exactly what I did, Jacob.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 But they told me to stop saying burnt.

113
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,440
 I started going campfire-y.

114
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
 Oh, this one tastes more like a brush fire.

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
 Overcooked bread.

116
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,440
 This definitely got a crematorium kind of vibe.

117
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,440
 Oh, this reminds me of one of the seasons in California.

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 Oh, fire seasons.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
 Yes, that's right.

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,440
 Fireworks, warehouse disaster, notes of black cat explosion.

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 Fireworks.

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,440
 This tastes very July 5th.

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,440
 July 5th.

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
 I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,440
 That would be an interesting coffee whiskey blend.

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 Yeah.

127
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
 A 5th of July.

128
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
 5th of July is a very funny--

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
 Right.

130
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 Make it like a drink.

132
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 Embered.

133
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 It's a 5th of July.

134
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 Right.

135
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Jacob.

136
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
 Boo sales are down.

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
 You should get on that.

138
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
 Boo sales are down?

139
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
 Yes.

140
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
 Boo sales are down.

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
 I was reading this the other day.

142
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,440
 To no one's surprise, Canadians don't feel like drinking American whiskey right now.

143
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 Yeah.

144
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
 Which at least makes me happy.

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 If they're not going to come see my little American show on the Las Vegas strip, please

146
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 don't buy the easier things to buy too.

147
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
 If you're going to keep your money away from my shit, go ahead and keep it away from the

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
 other shit too.

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 It really is funny because we probably have some Canadians here up on our chat.

150
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
 Yeah, because they're not afraid to travel to our chat room.

151
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 But basically, when you go like, "Oh, come on Canada," it definitely is like, "Oh."

152
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,440
 And then all that comes to mind is like, "We've been giving Canada shit for so long.

153
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
 All we do is fucking fuck with Canadians."

154
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
 And finally it's like, "No, really.

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
 This time, I'm leaving."

156
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,440
 And you're like, "No, come on, baby."

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
 Come on.

158
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 She never left before.

159
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
 She always just came back.

160
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
 Where are you going, baby?

161
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 Where are you going?

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 I can change Canada.

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 You know my heart, Canada.

164
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,440
 You know my heart.

165
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
 Yeah.

166
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:05,440
 I mean, look, man, for all the shitty American boycotting of businesses, Canada was like,

167
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
 "No, no, no.

168
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
 Really."

169
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
 No, we out.

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
 No, no.

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
 We really can flex, guys.

172
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,440
 I don't know if we really can.

173
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
 Yeah.

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
 We got a couple of people living here.

175
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
 Yeah.

176
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,440
 It's not just some little island.

177
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
 Yeah.

178
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 Yeah.

179
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
 It's pretty crazy.

180
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
 Pretty crazy.

181
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
 It's nuts.

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
 I just listened to...

183
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
 Oh, that's true.

184
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,600
 Scooper Nova Girl with the John Candy movie, Canadian Bacon, with the recommend Canadian

185
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 Bacon.

186
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
 A fine film.

187
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 Oh, yes.

188
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 It is a fine film.

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 It is.

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
 There's definitely poignant at this point.

191
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,820
 My favorite murder take on the heist, the big booze heist that happened out of the Johnny

192
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,880
 Walker distillery, did you hear about all that craziness that's happened in the, I guess

193
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,680
 it was early '90s?

194
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
 No.

195
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,400
 Did you ever hear this story, Jacob?

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 I'm surprised.

197
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
 I don't think so.

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 Maybe.

199
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
 I don't know.

200
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
 This guy...

201
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
 Refresh my memory.

202
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,840
 What's that really famous old granddad?

203
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,560
 Not old granddad.

204
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,880
 What's the one that's really high end, the bottle that goes for crazy money?

205
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,080
 Pappy Van Winkle?

206
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 That's it.

207
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
 Pappy Van Winkle.

208
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
 Oh, there you go.

209
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,440
 So they had Pappy Van Winkle's on display in this guy.

210
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,880
 This guy was working for the distillery for years and he worked his way up from distributing

211
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,440
 to being like a warehouse manager.

212
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,840
 Basically they had no security whatsoever and he started stealing Pappy Van Winkle bottles

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
 and he'd just steal them out of the display cases in the place.

214
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,400
 Yeah, he'd just take them from all over the place.

215
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,520
 If he saw one not nailed down, he was taking it.

216
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,880
 Yeah, and selling them for lots of money and just started off small and by the end of it,

217
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,600
 he was just going crazy.

218
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,040
 Yeah, there was a Netflix special about him.

219
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
 Yes, I believe so.

220
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,720
 Because it was at the Buffalo Trace distillery.

221
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 That's it.

222
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,840
 It was the Buffalo Trace distillery.

223
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,280
 That's the ones that make that booze.

224
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,960
 They make the Van Winkle line.

225
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,080
 He was taking them, he was selling to his friends, he was selling to neighbors, he was

226
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
 selling them all over the place.

227
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 It's a wild story.

228
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,160
 And of course, he didn't stop at selling them to his next door neighbor for 500 bucks in

229
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 cash or whatever.

230
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
 No.

231
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,320
 He had to put stuff online, got too big, and of course he got caught.

232
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,200
 Yeah, yeah, and all the records are on his phone.

233
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,680
 He didn't use a burner or anything, it's just his phone, all that kind of shit.

234
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,000
 It's like grand larceny that easily reached the stage of being a big fucking crime.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Totally.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,680
 And there's a similar incident in Canada, but it involves maple syrup.

237
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,120
 Oh, I was going to guess hockey sticks.

238
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,320
 Your mission, should you choose to accept it?

239
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,320
 A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A. It's a Canadian version.

240
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,960
 It's a guy walking out, but everything he touches is sticky.

241
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,280
 All his papers and stuff just attached to him as he walks out.

242
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,040
 I think you might be guilty, pal.

243
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,760
 No, no.

244
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,960
 I'm just wearing a sponge suit and I dip myself into a vat of maple syrup and then I'm going

245
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,760
 to go home and wring myself out.

246
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
 Gross.

247
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,920
 Sell it to a farmer's market.

248
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,280
 I'm so sorry to have to ask this, but did you steal that maple syrup?

249
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 I'm sorry to ask, but did you steal it?

250
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
 I don't know.

251
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,240
 If something just attaches to your body, is it theft or did it choose to go with you?

252
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
 Oh, God.

253
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
 Did he stole it?

254
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
 That's a fine question.

255
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,080
 He dipped in it and then rinsed it off and sold rinse, rinsy maple syrup?

256
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:40,520
 This maple syrup that I buy from the store, I mean, sure, it tastes like maple syrup,

257
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,360
 but the maple syrup I buy from Ted down the street, now it's got a little something.

258
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
 It's got a zing.

259
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
 He fucking, he fucking baby birded that shit.

260
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,760
 He took a giant straw, and then just waved as he walked out like, "Hmm, hmm, hmm."

261
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 Oh, gross.

262
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
 He kept it in his mouth.

263
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,400
 Because he was sucking up maple syrup through a giant straw, it's so upsetting.

264
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,280
 He siphoned it into his pants?

265
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,440
 See you later, everybody.

266
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 Oh, gross.

267
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
 That's so horrible.

268
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
 Bro, and he just-

269
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
 I don't know why that bothers me more than anything else on this show ever has.

270
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,040
 It's just a mouthful of syrup, like he's only able to fill up one little-

271
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,200
 The medicine go down, the medicine go down.

272
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,480
 He fills up those little travel bottles every day, he just fills up a travel bottle.

273
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,120
 He's only making like $2 a day with it.

274
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,540
 He's siphoning maple syrup, sucking it into a hose.

275
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,680
 You guys can drink these fireball on the plane, or you can have grade B tasty maple syrup.

276
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,860
 Grade B?

277
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,080
 Grade B but edible tasty maple syrup.

278
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,280
 Scully's like, "Nah, he butt chugged it like a turtle."

279
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,800
 Most fun way to get diabetes for $1,000, Alex.

280
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,680
 Jason Victor, yeah, the little maple leaf.

281
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
 Butt chugging like a turtle.

282
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,320
 The little maple leaf shaped souvenir bottles, that's exactly what I was picturing.

283
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 Exactly.

284
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720
 Oh man.

285
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,760
 But I actually know no details about the maple syrup that you're talking about.

286
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,280
 Yeah, it was a similar kind of thing, like insiders figuring out where maple syrup was

287
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:22,880
 being transported and hijacking entire busloads of, truckloads of maple syrup.

288
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
 Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars worth of maple syrup.

289
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,400
 Billions?

290
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,120
 I don't know about billions.

291
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
 Galactic president.

292
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
 If you count the tariffs, it's billions.

293
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,680
 Nowadays it could be, nowadays it could be, everything's up.

294
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,240
 Galactic president says, "Custom idea, maple syrup leg."

295
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,060
 Oh yeah, not a bad idea.

296
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,200
 Not a bad idea.

297
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 Ooze.

298
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 Ooze.

299
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,160
 I went and saw two shows recently.

300
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
 Okay.

301
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
 Ooh.

302
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:02,000
 I saw Lucy Darling over at the NGM and she was playing, of course, with our good friend

303
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Sarah Hester-Ross.

304
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Awesome.

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Amazing.

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,760
 How was that?

307
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,400
 It was incredible.

308
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 It was fascinating.

309
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,400
 I say that just because, you know, obviously I come to Lucy through the magic world.

310
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,360
 Those of you who aren't familiar, you probably have seen Lucy Darling clips on your social

311
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,120
 media because she's really blown up.

312
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
 Right?

313
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
 Oh yeah.

314
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
 She's everywhere.

315
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,360
 She's still on improperly crowd work and so it's funny because like basically magicians

316
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,920
 want to like hate her for being successful, right?

317
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,160
 You actually hate everyone who blows up like when Justin Willman first came around, everyone

318
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,200
 wanted to hate Justin Willman.

319
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
 Like it just happens.

320
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,080
 But people say like the dumbest shit, right?

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,960
 So at first they were saying, you know, she's putting up, she's selling out these theaters,

322
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,160
 but they're very small theaters.

323
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,520
 And I was laughing and I was like, "Yes, please."

324
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,600
 Are you selling out a small theater, sir?

325
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 Yeah.

326
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 Give me that problem tomorrow.

327
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,800
 Wait, what are they making?

328
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,040
 So they're making fun of her for saying that she is selling out theaters and they're coming

329
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,880
 back and just being like, "Yeah, yeah, but they're little."

330
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,000
 The base kind of says she's not as big time as you think she is or something like that,

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 right?

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Yeah.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Okay.

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Fine.

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Right.

336
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Exactly.

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And by the way, like she would sell a small theater, but like eight shows in a row.

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So it was like, "Okay."

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,840
 Like basically that just means like she could have played a big theater and went, "Oops,

340
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 I booked the wrong theater."

341
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,280
 So like, okay, great.

342
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,920
 And she's smart.

343
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,680
 Like she's figured out something that I am chasing, right?

344
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,840
 She's figured out how to put herself online without spoiling all of her magic tricks.

345
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
 Yes.

346
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
 That is true.

347
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,160
 She just has her interacting with people, getting laughs and it's out, right?

348
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,840
 Oh, you know, yeah, that's true.

349
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,760
 She's putting like funny moments of her show online, but not really revealing the tricks.

350
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,280
 Man, if you had funny moments in your show that you could put online, that'd be so convenient.

351
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,320
 The problem is those aren't as easy to buy as magic tricks.

352
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 That's true.

353
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
 That's true.

354
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
 So it's like-

355
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
 Now foiled again.

356
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,920
 Now I hate Lucy Darling too.

357
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,360
 I put the ads out on Fiverr.

358
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,080
 I just can't get the jokes.

359
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:25,680
 So then someone said, well, you know, obviously people were just getting into her because

360
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
 of her crowd work.

361
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,400
 Some people were going to the show not even knowing she's a magician, right?

362
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
 Oh no.

363
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
 Right.

364
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,920
 They're just being like, that's what's going to like ruin their experience.

365
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
 Like I came to see-

366
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
 I came to see it.

367
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,080
 I'm a comedian.

368
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 She does magic tricks.

369
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
 I'm fucking out of here.

370
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,160
 And now she knows what card I picked.

371
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
 Fucking out of here.

372
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 Disgusting.

373
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,600
 Well, I'm here to go ahead and put a bow on that as well.

374
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
 Because when I went and saw her in the show, I was curious.

375
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 I wasn't in agreement with these people, but I was curious about what am I going to go

376
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 see?

377
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 Of course.

378
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 Yeah.

379
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 I didn't even know I was going to see Sarah Starrus.

380
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
 I didn't even know that Sarah Starrus was there.

381
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
 Nice.

382
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,640
 And I know those two have been doing shows downtown at the- what's that spot called?

383
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,560
 Where our old improv theater used to be.

384
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
 The Inspire?

385
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
 Yeah.

386
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
 No, no, no.

387
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
 I know what it used to be called.

388
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
 Norman Square, where the Onyx was.

389
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
 Yeah, yeah.

390
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
 Now there's a venue there.

391
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 Anyway.

392
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
 Oh really?

393
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
 There's a venue there.

394
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
 Yeah.

395
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
 Yes.

396
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
 Is it that same space?

397
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
 No.

398
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,940
 It's in the middle there.

399
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,880
 A newly built space.

400
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 Kind of new.

401
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
 What's his name?

402
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,460
 Look at me with all the fucking details.

403
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,360
 Left Caesars and started running that space.

404
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,800
 And I saw Sarah Starrus there.

405
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,360
 I had all the details when I talked about going to see Sarah Starrus's show.

406
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
 Okay.

407
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,680
 Remember I talked about how she packed it on a Monday night.

408
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
 Anyhow.

409
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 Let's see.

410
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,120
 The Beverly, the Huntridge, Third Street, Notoriety.

411
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,160
 Nope, nope, nope.

412
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
 I'm just looking at downtown theaters.

413
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
 I don't know.

414
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 We'll figure it out later.

415
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
 We'll figure it out.

416
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 That's cool.

417
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
 I'll figure it out.

418
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
 Yeah.

419
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
 Anyhow.

420
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
 So they have chemistry.

421
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
 Like amazing chemistry.

422
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
 Yes.

423
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
 Like they really play off each other like very well.

424
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,220
 And it's really, really fun.

425
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,120
 And Sarah Hester Ross is so much dirtier than Lucy Darling, which is really funny.

426
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,520
 And Sarah is filthy.

427
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,680
 For people who have only experienced Sarah Hester Ross on this show, you don't understand

428
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,120
 how filthy Sarah can be on stage.

429
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,480
 And she's the, she's the headliner, so to speak.

430
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,200
 She's the second act.

431
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
 They just share the stage.

432
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
 She's a piano player.

433
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
 Oh, awesome.

434
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
 They just play off each other.

435
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 It is awesome.

436
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 It is awesome.

437
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,840
 And Sarah Starrus was a sniper, right?

438
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
 Like, you know, she's, she's used to running her own show.

439
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,320
 She's in like maybe she's like 20% of the show for this show.

440
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,480
 And so she just was like stepping up and just killing it every time she needed to.

441
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,520
 It was really great to see.

442
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
 Okay.

443
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,320
 But this audience indeed loves Lucy Darling and just wants her to do crowd work.

444
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,080
 And that's what she did.

445
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,640
 It was a 90 minute show.

446
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,840
 The crowd was eating out of her hands the entire time, like roaring and loving everything

447
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 she was saying.

448
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,840
 They were saying her lines for her, famous lines from her TikToks for her.

449
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,120
 And she did all of two magic tricks to two, two and 90 minutes.

450
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,960
 I didn't know she was going to do magic tricks.

451
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,200
 Well, it's, it's kind of like Brad Sherwood was saying crowd work slash improv.

452
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
 It's a kind of magic trick.

453
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,000
 Just tricks, right?

454
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Sure.

455
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,320
 She, she has, she basically just kind of gave like four people roles, two people with big

456
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,420
 roles in the show and just kind of dared them to play along with the storytelling stuff

457
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,240
 and improv.

458
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,320
 And that sounds awesome, man.

459
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 Exactly.

460
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
 Right.

461
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,480
 Like I was laughing because like Emily Gillette has always been very kind to all of us and

462
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,600
 was super kind to me, especially early on in my Vegas time here producing improv shows

463
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,480
 and things like that.

464
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,040
 And whenever I talked to her now and I talk about being magician, she always goes like,

465
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:24,560
 like, she's always like, and I'm always laughing like, why, why do you hate that I'm a magician

466
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
 now?

467
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
 Right?

468
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,200
 And she always goes, I just don't think it's the only thing you're going to do.

469
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
 I just think you're going to do more.

470
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
 Okay.

471
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
 Which is, which is fine.

472
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
 Yeah, that's fine.

473
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
 That's a fine answer.

474
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,340
 But I really didn't know what she was talking about.

475
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,120
 When I saw Lucy darling show, I was like, oh, this is what Emily Jett would love if

476
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,880
 I was doing like, this is actually, I did two little magic tricks in the middle and

477
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,120
 did 90 minutes of just me fucking around with my comedy friends and just making the audience

478
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,720
 roar with laughter.

479
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,840
 She would love it.

480
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 Who was that dude?

481
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 You're right.

482
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,800
 That very, I don't want to use the word pretentious exactly, but it was a very Matt Donnelly.

483
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 Precious.

484
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,240
 It was a very precious magic show.

485
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
 It wasn't a lot of magic, but oh, I know who you're talking about.

486
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,920
 I have, I have his t-shirt.

487
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,560
 It's a classic magician here in Vegas.

488
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
 He's not around anymore.

489
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
 Hill Bill.

490
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
 Oh, yeah.

491
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,280
 I thought you were going to say, I thought you were going to say, Hans clock or something.

492
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
 No.

493
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
 Steve.

494
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
 Steve Weirich.

495
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
 No, no, no, no, no.

496
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,720
 It was a Broadway special that this guy, and he had a moment about three years ago, I want

497
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,560
 to say where he was the kid.

498
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,080
 You're talking about Derek Delgadio.

499
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
 That's who I'm talking about.

500
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 Oh, okay.

501
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,600
 What's up with his new, is he doing something else now?

502
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,720
 Is he just, what's happening?

503
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,440
 He's doing a whole fish noodling thing.

504
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
 Okay.

505
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,880
 He was hanging out with him the other night by accident.

506
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
 He's fine.

507
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
 Okay.

508
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,320
 He's always fine.

509
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,080
 You know, he's, he's very much in demand in corporate and private show settings.

510
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
 So he's got it.

511
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
 He's got his niche.

512
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 Yeah.

513
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 Yeah.

514
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 Yeah.

515
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
 That's great.

516
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 We don't need to set up like a Kickstarter for him.

517
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
 I don't think so.

518
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 Okay.

519
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,280
 Is he still doing a version of that show anywhere or is that kind of retired?

520
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,000
 He's just, uh, I believe that's retired.

521
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Right.

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Right.

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Yeah.

524
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,640
 So they had partnered with this guy Helger, I think was his name, Spanish guy.

525
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,040
 And they did a two person show with like all card tricks that Neil Patrick Harris fell

526
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
 in love with and produced.

527
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,760
 And it had like a crazy run at the Geffen theater, like a, or unheard of like six month

528
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
 run in Los Angeles.

529
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,920
 So he's had a couple of real feathers in the cap already.

530
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
 So okay, cool.

531
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
 Yeah.

532
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,440
 He's like a real, uh, kind of like highly esteemed magician in the ranks or whatever.

533
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
 Yeah.

534
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,600
 He also, uh, famously tried to get brushwood kicked out of the castle for dress code violations,

535
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,840
 um, uh, for performing out of dress code.

536
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:03,480
 So, uh, in fairness, anytime I go to the magic castle, I try to get Brian brushwood.

537
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,000
 Why are magicians such catty bitches?

538
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 What the fuck?

539
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,920
 I mean, this is all old news, but it was just funny because three tricks for them all to

540
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,580
 share Paul, because I only ended up hanging out with them happen in the happenstance way.

541
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,120
 And so I literally was like, Oh, and that's funny.

542
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
 It's like, and basically my brain is going like, do not bring up Brian, do not bring

543
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 up Brian.

544
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
 Do not.

545
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,960
 That's all I was going in my areas because the answer could have been like, Oh my God,

546
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
 that's so embarrassing.

547
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,880
 I was so into it back then and I was trying to be a castle boy and blah, blah, blah.

548
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,560
 Or it could be like, I still think the castles got too much and it was like, no, it could

549
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,480
 definitely be like, fuck that guy still.

550
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,160
 And I was like brushwood even told me the story so long ago.

551
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,080
 I was like, I don't even, like, I, like, I was like, I don't even know if he might not

552
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
 even remember it.

553
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,580
 He, he might've been like, you did not.

554
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,560
 If I said, if I brought it up, he'd be like, please tell me you did not bring up that.

555
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,240
 So I kept my mouth shut.

556
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
 So you brought it up?

557
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,360
 No, I, this is it.

558
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,320
 I'm laughing because 10 years ago, I absolutely would have just been like, you know, I had

559
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,200
 to ask cause I got your back, man.

560
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,720
 You know, I've learned because of Penn and Teller, I used to carry other people's water

561
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,600
 for so many conflicts and they'd be like, oh no, we buried that.

562
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 And I'd be like, what?

563
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
 Oh shit.

564
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,720
 I've been furious at that guy for eight years.

565
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,340
 That's really fucking funny.

566
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,160
 Even with, I mean, maybe I shouldn't say this, but even like at one point, Tapeface and Piff

567
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
 had beef.

568
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,760
 Oh yeah.

569
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,400
 And Piff totally forgot to tell me that they absolutely buried it.

570
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,400
 That they absolutely, like, that they absolutely like made amends and get along and whatever.

571
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,520
 And I was like, what?

572
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
 I was carrying around hatred in my heart.

573
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,160
 I was, I was awkward with him at red carpets.

574
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,120
 Cause they weren't even like big beef.

575
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,320
 They were just like, it was like misunderstanding beef.

576
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,080
 And they both knew it was misunderstanding beef before they squashed it.

577
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
 I think.

578
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
 Yes.

579
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
 They were, they were basically both.

580
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,280
 They were both okay even before they squashed it.

581
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,680
 They ended up being accidentally played against one another via casino people and about like

582
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,320
 trying to find homes and casinos and stuff.

583
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,760
 It was just, you know, business stuff that actually is pretty boring when you break down

584
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
 the nuts and bolts of it.

585
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
 Yeah.

586
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
 It sounds exciting on the surface, but it's nothing.

587
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,920
 I'll tell you who else has beef with Piff the magic dragon and with Tapeface.

588
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,080
 I mean, the three of these people are going to fight Piff Tapeface and this following

589
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,560
 sponsor are definitely going to have a physical altercation.

590
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,200
 Today's show is brought to you by, where is it?

591
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 God damn it.

592
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
 Here it is.

593
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,000
 I think I just put it in the more prominent place on my cell phone.

594
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,920
 Not, not in the middle of row two on screen four of my apps, but a cat scratch fever salve

595
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,520
 cat scratch fever salve is our sponsor and it's from semi pro dad in 2022.

596
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,840
 That's cat scratch fever salve.

597
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,600
 Hey, what's going on everybody?

598
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,560
 It's me, Paul Stanley.

599
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
 Yeah.

600
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:20,240
 I'm here to help out my good friend who can't be here today.

601
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:28,920
 The YY man himself, the cat scratch fever boss, you know him, you love him.

602
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 He dates children.

603
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:41,200
 I can't remember his stupid name, but anyway, that's not important because he's not here.

604
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,800
 I am.

605
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:49,160
 I want to tell you about some really good stuff that he's selling that I'm pimping.

606
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,960
 It's called crat scratch fever salve.

607
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,160
 You ever get a scratch from a kitty kitty, you ever get a little bruise, little scratch

608
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
 on your arm.

609
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,680
 Do you want that to get infected?

610
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
 No.

611
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
 No.

612
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,880
 Here's the best thing to do.

613
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 Go ahead.

614
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,040
 Oh, I remember his dumb name is Ted Nugent.

615
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,080
 Anyway, so what you want to do is go ahead and get you some of Ted Nugent's Paul Stanley

616
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
 cat scratch fever salve.

617
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:27,420
 Ted Nugent's Paul Stanley cat scratch fever salve is guaranteed to end inflammation and

618
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,360
 stop irritation and prevent infection.

619
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 Yeah.

620
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,360
 Some of you might have been using wipes.

621
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,360
 Some of you might have been using disinfectant alcohol.

622
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:47,640
 I'm here to tell you what's better is Paul Stanley's Ted Nugent's cat scratch fever

623
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,040
 salve.

624
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:57,920
 It's medicated, it's vibrated and it is perforated for your enjoyment.

625
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
 That's right.

626
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
 Take it from me.

627
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
 Perforated?

628
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
 The star child.

629
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
 I wouldn't lie to you.

630
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
 Buy it.

631
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 Enter Hayscoops at checkout.

632
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
 Buy.

633
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:17,840
 Saying "buy" is hysterical.

634
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,160
 I said "buy" but I should have just said "buy".

635
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,440
 Oh, I thought you were saying like I'm done making this commercial now.

636
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
 Goodbye.

637
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
 It's over.

638
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
 I'm through.

639
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
 I'm through that idea.

640
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
 Buy it.

641
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
 There it is.

642
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
 Cat scratch fever balm.

643
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
 There it is.

644
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
 It's real.

645
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:42,480
 How about, how about old Gene getting into the Kennedy Center?

646
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
 Gene and Paul both?

647
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,040
 You're at the Kennedy Center.

648
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
 Stop it.

649
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
 Paul agreed to go?

650
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,720
 Well, I mean, they are, like Paul and Gene are kiss.

651
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
 No, I think it's just, I think it's just Gene.

652
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,720
 Paul's been pretty adamantly anti.

653
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,880
 I don't know that they're going to go together.

654
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,080
 I'll be very surprised and disappointed.

655
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
 I mean, somewhat surprised.

656
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,800
 And talking about the Kennedy Center honorees this year?

657
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 Yes, yes.

658
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 Yeah, yeah.

659
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

660
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:16,360
 By the way, I don't have any beef with anybody going in, like the honorees, I'm fine with

661
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 all the honorees.

662
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,960
 Does anybody care about the honoree, like, are people saying these people shouldn't be

663
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
 going into the Kennedy Center?

664
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
 Sharing is exactly what we're talking about here.

665
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,680
 It reminds me of when Barry Bonds was breaking the home run record.

666
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
 Yeah.

667
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
 A little bit, yeah.

668
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,720
 And everyone was like, they want to do all this stuff like launch the ball in outer space,

669
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,280
 you know, all this other stuff.

670
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,320
 And Brandon Asterix on to it.

671
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
 What someone said is like, all that's going to happen is we're going to stop caring about

672
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
 the home run record.

673
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
 And that's exactly what we did.

674
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
 Yeah.

675
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
 We just stopped caring about it.

676
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
 Yeah, that's it.

677
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,440
 And then someone does a trick with baseball cards, I can tell you, the ramifications of

678
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,260
 the steroid era are real, because when I ask people who likes baseball, and it's mostly

679
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,680
 young people in the audience, no one says yes.

680
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,880
 And sometimes, audibly, people go like, not me.

681
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
 Yeah, not me.

682
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,320
 And I don't really go like, oh, no, and I'll even come with them with a bucket of baseball

683
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 cards.

684
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
 And they literally look at me like, no, I hate baseball.

685
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
 I'm like, it's the first and the last thing.

686
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 I hate baseball.

687
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 Can you chill out?

688
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,160
 They hate baseball so much they're like allergic to baseball cards.

689
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
 They literally recoil.

690
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
 Holy shit.

691
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,760
 I mean, I'm coming at them with an evasive extending pole and bucket.

692
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
 Sure.

693
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
 That it might not be.

694
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
 No, I understand the recoiling.

695
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
 Might not be.

696
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,280
 Might not be just the subject of baseball.

697
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,640
 I'm a little off putting myself.

698
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
 But it's amazing, the negative impact of baseball.

699
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,760
 And even now, even in my baseball card collection that I use, I have a lot of old players in

700
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
 there.

701
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,720
 And I thought about replacing them with new ones and it's basically.

702
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
 Nobody cares.

703
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
 Nobody knows.

704
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,520
 I can maybe put Otani in.

705
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
 Yeah.

706
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
 Yeah.

707
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 I can maybe put Judge.

708
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
 A-Rod.

709
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
 A-Rod's the latest, right?

710
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
 I think you put Otani.

711
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
 I think you put.

712
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
 Yeah, A-Rod's in there.

713
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,360
 That's why A-Rod features in my thing is I think it's the only one.

714
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 I think it's the most.

715
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,280
 And that's just because he was married to that dancer lady for a minute.

716
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
 J-Lo.

717
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
 Jennifer Lopez?

718
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
 You could maybe do Mike Trout.

719
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 Was that her?

720
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
 Yeah.

721
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
 That dancer lady.

722
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
 A very famous celebrity.

723
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
 She was a fly girl.

724
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
 Yeah.

725
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
 Yes.

726
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
 Everything Paul is saying is true.

727
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
 Dancer lady, fly girl.

728
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
 Please don't write us saying that Paul was right.

729
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
 We know he's right.

730
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:25,000
 I mean, if you look up her IMDB, it starts off with famous dancer lady, Jennifer Lopez.

731
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,020
 If you look up her IMDB, which no one has done.

732
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:34,760
 We also have owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves as well as a result of multiple lawsuits, A-Rod

733
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
 is the owner of the Timberwolves.

734
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,960
 Oh, I thought you about to say J-Lo owns the Timberwolves.

735
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
 No, no, no.

736
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,240
 That was going to be surprising to me.

737
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
 Yeah.

738
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
 But I mean, like that's it.

739
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
 Like A-Rod is featured in the tricks simply because that's the one I believe that most

740
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
 people would know.

741
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
 Right.

742
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
 Even if you don't like sports.

743
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
 Yeah.

744
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,400
 And that's an old joke, right?

745
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,640
 Like I made that decision eight years ago, right?

746
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
 And so right.

747
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,440
 That's crazy that that's that it's that old and it still seems like that's it.

748
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
 Like what else?

749
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
 Like you're right.

750
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,480
 Like Otani is the only other name I even know.

751
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,040
 I've been a couple of Pirates games.

752
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 I couldn't tell you any of those players.

753
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,120
 No, I actually I haven't done that a lot, but I should.

754
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,920
 I really want to ask my kids like name a baseball player, name a professional baseball player.

755
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,240
 Like a current one.

756
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,680
 Is there a, is there any way for you to get Savannah banana cards in there?

757
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,040
 Because you could put like still no one still knows individual Savannah bananas.

758
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,280
 People know what the Savannah people know still in those individual play.

759
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 They will not still.

760
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 I don't know stilts.

761
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
 He comes.

762
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 He plays.

763
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
 I understand what you're saying.

764
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,640
 I understand what you're saying.

765
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
 How do people not know stilts?

766
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,080
 I believe that if I were watching a baseball game and there were a player on the field

767
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,840
 wearing stilts and I heard people referring to a player called stilts, I would know which

768
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,760
 player to pick him out of a lineup that night, but after that I'd be able to using the context

769
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
 clues.

770
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,000
 I'd be able to figure out who you meant.

771
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,440
 If I were to say scooped up by Roberto Clemente and thrown over to stilts, I don't think the

772
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,480
 audience would be like, yes, you're right.

773
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,480
 This is Savannah bananas.

774
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,960
 I don't think he just made a Savannah bananas reference.

775
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,760
 What about characters from the sandlot?

776
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,160
 There we go.

777
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,200
 You're right in that I'm trying to consider doing a whole different deal altogether rather

778
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,160
 than I don't want to go back to cards, but I'm trying to think of something just entirely

779
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
 different.

780
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
 There are Marvel trading cards.

781
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,120
 Everybody knows Marvel characters.

782
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:44,600
 Somebody did say earlier, Marcelo in the chat said earlier that you could get rid of the

783
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,120
 baseball cards and just put in Pokemon cards.

784
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,900
 Pokemon would be really funny too.

785
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,880
 I think Marvel is a stronger move than, we've turned this into a brainstorming session,

786
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 but I think-

787
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,480
 It just has a stronger grip on the zeitgeist.

788
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
 Everybody knows Marvel.

789
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
 Not everybody knows.

790
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
 For Matt Show!

791
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,680
 Except it's my production.

792
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,040
 It's the My Newly Magic production meeting.

793
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,560
 Production meeting for Matt Show.

794
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,320
 No, Marvel characters are smart and it's actually smart too because I really want to get a Disney

795
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
 cruise ship.

796
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
 Oh yeah.

797
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
 There you go.

798
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
 That's the way to go, man.

799
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
 Go with Marvel art cards.

800
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,520
 Oh, well they've got to be just Disney trading cards.

801
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
 No.

802
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
 There's Lor-Kana.

803
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
 That's got to exist too.

804
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
 You don't want to do Lor-Kana.

805
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
 Jacob.

806
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
 Mine are fake anyway.

807
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
 Yeah.

808
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,640
 No, but there are Marvel art cards from back in the day.

809
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
 What?

810
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
 Oh shit.

811
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,480
 This is what happens when people pretend to steal.

812
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,560
 Like I have like Mickey Mantle and stuff and they pretend to steal it in their pocket.

813
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,160
 In fact, someone has stolen a card from my-

814
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
 Oh no.

815
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,960
 I thought it was a valuable baseball card.

816
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
 Someone stole a Cal Ripken.

817
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,440
 They think it was a valuable baseball card and so when they do it, I go like, "And if

818
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,040
 you think you're taking an actual baseball card from a working magician, you go ahead

819
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,000
 and keep that in your pocket and you tell all your friends."

820
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,720
 If you think this working magician has a Cal Ripken rookie card that he's passing around

821
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
 to you.

822
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,040
 No, the answer is fucking Marvel Super Heroes.

823
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
 Yeah.

824
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

825
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
 Yeah.

826
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
 It's easy.

827
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
 That's just the answer.

828
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,280
 Anyhow, that's not what I was trying to talk about.

829
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,680
 Do they have to play baseball though for the trick to work?

830
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
 Yes.

831
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
 Yes.

832
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
 They have to play baseball.

833
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
 That's going to be a little-

834
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
 It's Iron Man playing baseball.

835
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,720
 People will know that this is a secret softball game that takes place every year between DC

836
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,400
 and Marvel.

837
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
 Let's go Marvel.

838
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
 Fuck DC.

839
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
 No.

840
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,160
 I am just going to go Marvel because Disney owns Marvel and doesn't own DC.

841
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
 Yes.

842
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
 Yeah.

843
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,320
 I'm just going to just go Marvel and then, no, I can narrate an event, Paul, instead of

844
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
 narrating a baseball game.

845
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
 Fantastic.

846
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
 I can still narrate an event.

847
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
 That would be cool, man.

848
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 Yeah.

849
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
 That would be very cool.

850
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,920
 Because even my intro of it is like, the intro of it is when I was a kid I liked the movie

851
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,480
 Field of Dreams.

852
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,760
 That's getting diminishing applause.

853
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
 Sure.

854
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
 Eight years later.

855
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
 Sure.

856
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
 Yeah.

857
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,840
 It was nice when Kevin Costner was hitting again with Yellowstone, but that's gone now

858
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
 too.

859
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
 That's gone.

860
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,840
 Well, I think Puddles has stolen all the Costner fire.

861
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
 That's just-

862
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
 That's true.

863
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
 There's nothing left.

864
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
 There's nothing left.

865
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,680
 In fact, when I was doing it, Heidi Klum came in off the street and said, "Stop stealing

866
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,800
 everything from Puddles," and then went back out on the street.

867
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 Just wanted to make sure she hated him.

868
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,120
 I think Puddles did that after you started talking about it.

869
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,840
 Well, our attorneys will figure that out.

870
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
 Sure.

871
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,600
 I'm referencing, by the way, when I failed on America's Got Talent, and while they were

872
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,720
 judging me, I pulled out an apple and I sliced the apple with the knife I used for my card

873
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,840
 stab and started eating the apple, and Heidi Klum yelled, "You can't steal everything

874
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:59,840
 from Piff," at me with a hatred that was trying to stop a protest or something.

875
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,960
 It was with a family passion that she yelled at me.

876
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
 Yeah.

877
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
 It was really startling.

878
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,000
 We're talking about our blood oath loyalties.

879
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,720
 In the chat, we're getting some really good people talking about the times they were convinced

880
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,080
 to take a blood oath.

881
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
 Let's see here.

882
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
 Too many people have chatted.

883
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
 I've lost track.

884
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,480
 But someone in the chat was like, "An Olive Garden fired their cousin, and so the whole

885
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,520
 family protested all of Olive Gardens."

886
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
 The long-term grudges?

887
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
 Oh, I see.

888
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
 I see.

889
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,860
 The blood vendettas, not the blood oaths.

890
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
 Right.

891
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
 Jason Victor.

892
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
 Jason, are you unmuted?

893
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
 Yeah.

894
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
 Yeah.

895
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
 Yeah.

896
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
 What happened?

897
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
 You were fired?

898
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,860
 No.

899
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
 Who got fired?

900
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
 My cousin.

901
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,860
 Actually, it was kind of messed up.

902
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,800
 My cousin was a waiter at Olive Garden, but he was really theatrical, and he would sing

903
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,120
 at tables and do all this.

904
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,920
 He was a tremendous performer and everything.

905
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,480
 He was in all these plays and shows.

906
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,900
 He would use tongs and pretend to be a crab and scuttle across the floor.

907
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,000
 Everybody loved him.

908
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,880
 A week before he was set to retire, they fired him without a cause.

909
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,840
 My grandmother was like, "No.

910
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
 We will never go to Olive Garden."

911
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,280
 A week before he was set to retire, did he get knocked out of benefits and things because

912
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
 of that?

913
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
 Yeah.

914
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
 Yeah.

915
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
 Yeah.

916
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
 Whoa.

917
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
 It was messed up.

918
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,920
 Also, I'm finding out right now that Olive Garden has retirement programs.

919
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,280
 Now, this is third-hand storytelling.

920
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,680
 That's what we're built on.

921
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,080
 We're built on hearsay and conjecture.

922
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
 That's fine.

923
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
 That's fine.

924
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
 That's what makes this work.

925
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
 We don't have the authority to be a primary source podcast.

926
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
 No.

927
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
 That's not where we're at financially.

928
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,240
 Also, we don't have an ombudsman.

929
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
 It doesn't matter.

930
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
 We do not.

931
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,580
 Nobody's checking.

932
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,580
 Who knows?

933
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,680
 It was one side of the story, times three times people I've heard it from, so I don't

934
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,440
 mean to create a beef for the whole podcast here.

935
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,920
 Oh, jeez.

936
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,240
 We're getting a phone call right now.

937
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,760
 It's the following sponsor, but the following sponsor is Olive Garden calling in to rebut

938
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
 this story.

939
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,640
 Here we are with Olive Garden and their rebuttal, Take It Away Olive Garden.

940
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:29,160
 Hey, it's a me, Mario Olive, and that's my brother, Luigi Garden, and today we are

941
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:35,400
 going to tell you that we don't fire people because we don't want to pay for their retirement.

942
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,940
 We fire them because we hate the singing.

943
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,280
 We hate singing so much.

944
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,520
 We hate theater, and we often will not deliver food to any Broadway show.

945
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,160
 We will not offer endless breadsticks to anyone who knows how to play piano.

946
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,440
 We do not, we have a very firm, we've been against music from the inception of the founding

947
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
 of our company.

948
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,480
 How are you going to come to Olive Garden and sing one endless breadstick in the cover

949
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,040
 of your face?

950
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,740
 How are you going to sing an endless breadstick and a bottomless bowl of soup?

951
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,160
 Do you ever hear the phrase, "You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel"?

952
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
 That's the truth.

953
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,720
 You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel.

954
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,980
 So don't do it.

955
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,640
 It sounds a little different in Italian, it's more poetic, but keep going.

956
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:33,240
 In Italian it sounds like, "You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel."

957
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,480
 But translated that means, "You sing at the table, the devil will dance on your navel."

958
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
 Yeah, yeah.

959
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
 That's much better.

960
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
 I'm sorry if I lost anybody there.

961
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
 The English version sounds ridiculous.

962
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,360
 In my old country talk, boy I feel like I'm back at home.

963
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,280
 I feel like I'm back at home like a big old macaroni in my mouth.

964
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
 Oh.

965
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,800
 Enter the scoops at checkout.

966
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,560
 We should get a little occasion at the end.

967
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,280
 Oh, I like me some macaroni.

968
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,320
 Oh boy, what a guarantee.

969
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
 Go ahead and give me one.

970
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
 Yeah, I'm going to roll this game.

971
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
 I'm going to roll this LP role all the way over now.

972
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
 I'm going to give me some macaroni.

973
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
 I want you to go ahead and give me some of that.

974
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,840
 Go ahead and make my bolognese really spicy.

975
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:20,560
 I'm looking for some of that delicious lasagna.

976
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,800
 One last question for Jason.

977
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,360
 Did the protests hold?

978
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,160
 Have you never gone to an Olive Garden, and do you know that none of your family's ever

979
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,120
 gone to an Olive Garden?

980
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,200
 I think most of us have kept away from it for the most part, but if anyone did go, they

981
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
 would definitely.

982
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
 Wow.

983
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,840
 I think it's a real awkward Thanksgiving, I think, because you'd be like, "Really?

984
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
 Still?

985
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
 None of us?

986
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
 Not one Olive Garden?"

987
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
 It's so affordable.

988
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,080
 It's right near the movie theater where I take my kids, you sure?

989
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,800
 It's not great, but it's pretty good.

990
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,880
 You know, this is a blood feud that actually benefits your blood from a salt perspective,

991
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,960
 so that's kind of good.

992
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,080
 Yeah, and this is like decades ago too, at this point.

993
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,120
 This is a really old ... This happened a while ago, but I still remember, she's like, "No,

994
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,120
 we can't go."

995
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
 She called up everybody.

996
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
 She's like, "We can't go to an Olive Garden."

997
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,360
 Was there a lawsuit after all that?

998
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
 I don't think so.

999
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,320
 I got to actually ... I got to call them and see what they're doing.

1000
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
 Is he okay?

1001
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
 We got to get it.

1002
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
 Yeah, you get us an update on your cousin.

1003
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,640
 We're so busy hating Olive Garden because of the foiled retirement.

1004
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,760
 We never forgot the check.

1005
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,160
 Oh shit, my cousin died in 2020.

1006
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,760
 This was before GoFundMe's could help people like him.

1007
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,080
 Turns out he died right before COVID hit.

1008
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,480
 That's terrible.

1009
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,040
 My father won a defense case on this.

1010
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,960
 Everyone presented all of these evidence of threats and all this other crazy stuff and

1011
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,240
 phone records and all this stuff, and my father on cross-examination was like, "Anyone check

1012
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,480
 on him?

1013
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,880
 Anyone see if he was doing okay?

1014
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,080
 Like anyone ever talk to him about the threat?"

1015
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,400
 The answer was no.

1016
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,560
 No one actually went to see if the person actually had anything threatening happening

1017
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
 to him, and he got him off.

1018
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,960
 Logic wins the day.

1019
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,760
 I never get tired of hearing stories about Dave Donnelly getting guys off.

1020
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,200
 I know he's happily retired now just so everyone's not worried about Gary, but he's okay.

1021
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,740
 Does he still sing at the table?

1022
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,000
 I saw him recently, and I think he's still performing at the community theater down in

1023
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 Florida.

1024
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,760
 Every Christmas, he's like, "When they fired me from Olive Garden."

1025
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,280
 Oh, it's the story.

1026
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,400
 Oh, Gary's doing his song again.

1027
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,560
 Gary's doing his story song again.

1028
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
 We've heard this song.

1029
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,560
 Why is it every Christmas?

1030
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,600
 I was only a week away from retirement.

1031
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
 They cut me loose.

1032
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
 Shut the fuck up, Matt.

1033
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
 I love this song.

1034
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
 All right.

1035
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
 With no excuse.

1036
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,880
 Oh, this is your first Christmas with our family.

1037
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,880
 I forgot to tell you.

1038
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
 My uncle sings about the time he got fired from Olive Garden.

1039
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,200
 When you sing at the table, the devil dances on your navel.

1040
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
 Everyone knows that expression.

1041
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
 We all know that expression.

1042
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
 Have you guys never heard that?

1043
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
 No, I've never heard.

1044
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:16,320
 I've heard it in the original Italian, obviously, but never the translated version.

1045
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,960
 How was the Italian again?

1046
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,640
 When you sing at the table, and the devil, he'd dance on your navel.

1047
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,640
 That's it.

1048
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,320
 That's what I remember.

1049
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,040
 Bossy understood that, but nobody else got it.

1050
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,040
 Sure.

1051
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,040
 Very clearly.

1052
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
 Very clearly.

1053
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,040
 Thank you, Jason.

1054
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
 Oh, my heavens.

1055
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
 I hope his cousin is okay.

1056
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,040
 I mean, he's alive.

1057
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
 I think he's fine.

1058
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
 I'm sure.

1059
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
 I went into a bathroom the other day, a public bathroom.

1060
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,040
 Stop it.

1061
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,040
 Gross.

1062
00:45:45,040 --> 00:46:01,560
 I was going to use the said bathroom.

1063
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,920
 They had recently, it seemed, maybe painted the floor in the bathroom.

1064
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,000
 The paint they had chosen to use was that black paint that always looks wet, depending

1065
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,840
 on how you look at it, like from what angle you look at it.

1066
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,040
 So I'm in the bathroom, and I was like, "Is the whole ... " I thought the whole floor was

1067
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,080
 just wet, and I was trying to move her.

1068
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,080
 Oh, no.

1069
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,080
 I was so confused.

1070
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,960
 You know, when you walk into a public bathroom and you just see like a little, like, some

1071
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,000
 wet on the floor there, you just walk around it, you know, whatever.

1072
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,120
 This was, like, it was everywhere, and I had a moment of just sheer panic and didn't know

1073
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,700
 what to do before I realized it was just a terrible choice in paint by someone.

1074
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,260
 We had this happen when I was a kid.

1075
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:51,640
 Back in the day, we used to go to Kings Island as a family, back before I was working there.

1076
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:59,000
 And way back in the late '70s, which is when we went as a family, they used to have these

1077
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,280
 caves, these man-made ... They were basically, what do you call those, like ...

1078
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
 Holes.

1079
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,920
 Drainage tubes, big enough that you could walk through, you know what I mean?

1080
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,920
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1081
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,160
 But they build it like a half-tunnel, right?

1082
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,380
 So they made these tunnels, and they were these themed tunnels on ... One of them was

1083
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:28,520
 like a Tom Sawyer, so you'd walk through and you'd see Injun Joe and Becky Thatcher.

1084
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,760
 It was little static scenes of statues and things, but kind of retelling moments in the

1085
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
 stories.

1086
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,560
 Well, we go walking into one of these tunnels, and it had been raining that day.

1087
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:47,080
 And there was a pool of water in the tunnel, and the light was hitting it just right.

1088
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,280
 It looked like a pit.

1089
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,060
 It looked like a deadly pit that you couldn't go any further.

1090
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,140
 You would walk on it and you'd fall to your death.

1091
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:03,320
 But what it turned out was it was a reflection of the ceiling from that water puddle.

1092
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
 Gotcha.

1093
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
 Yeah, yeah.

1094
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,800
 It was an optical illusion that it made it look like you were going to fall and die,

1095
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,800
 but there was nothing.

1096
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,040
 But I take your point on the freakiness of walking around on a floor.

1097
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,400
 I was like, "Why would you paint this floor with this paint?"

1098
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,360
 Because then when it is done ... Dead Lazlo's been boycotting Boston markets since 1998

1099
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,280
 because they wouldn't let them get two of the same sides out of order.

1100
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,280
 Stop it.

1101
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,280
 Fair.

1102
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,280
 That is a reasonable reason to boycott Boston markets.

1103
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,600
 Why would you not be able to do that?

1104
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
 For 30 years.

1105
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,360
 And also that your boycott might work is really funny.

1106
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,400
 You indeed might have put them out of business.

1107
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
 You didn't help.

1108
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
 You didn't help.

1109
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,600
 Boston market had a smell, didn't it?

1110
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
 It did.

1111
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,240
 It had a very particular chicken seasoning.

1112
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,960
 It was real strong, real pungent, almost like not as offensive to me as a Subway, but same

1113
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
 kind of vibe.

1114
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,160
 That's Subway smell.

1115
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,940
 In Portugal, there was a Subway in Lisbon, a Subway sandwich shop in Lisbon, and I went

1116
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,720
 and stuck my head in just to see if they had the same smell.

1117
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,720
 Really?

1118
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,720
 Yeah.

1119
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
 This is a true story.

1120
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,720
 And they did.

1121
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,720
 They did.

1122
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,720
 Okay.

1123
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,720
 They did.

1124
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,720
 Same smell.

1125
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,720
 Overseas Subway shop.

1126
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,720
 Same smell.

1127
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,720
 Didn't matter.

1128
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,820
 I think it's just when you handle meat, it gives off a certain odor.

1129
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,820
 I think it's a meat-handling odor.

1130
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,520
 I think you're right, Paul.

1131
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,400
 If you suck it on maple syrup, it gives a different flavor palette.

1132
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,400
 Yeah.

1133
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
 Ugh.

1134
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,520
 Especially with my syrup, it was baby-birded to me by someone who worked at a Canadian maple

1135
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
 plant.

1136
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,160
 God damn it.

1137
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,600
 That's why he got fired from the Olive Garden, because he was spitting the linguine onto

1138
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
 the tables.

1139
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
 It was baby-birded.

1140
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:04,600
 How many times do I have to tell you not to baby-bird the linguine to our customers?

1141
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
 I'm here with some cheese.

1142
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,120
 You fired my uncle for his singing.

1143
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,240
 No, we fired your uncle for spitting food into other people's mouths.

1144
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,240
 I've got some grated Parmesan, say when.

1145
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
 When?

1146
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
 When?

1147
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
 When?

1148
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 I didn't want you to say when.

1149
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
 When?

1150
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 Okay.

1151
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
 An hour ago when.

1152
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 An hour ago.

1153
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
 Okay.

1154
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
 I'll be back if you need anything.

1155
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,960
 I'm sorry, do you have any fresh black pepper?

1156
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,840
 Hold on, I've got some between cheek and gum on the other side.

1157
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,680
 Oh no, God damn it, why did I ask?

1158
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,120
 Oh, I regret this.

1159
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:45,600
 I keep several different kinds of cheese and spice in my mouth while I'm serving.

1160
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,760
 So that I can dispense it at any time.

1161
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,760
 It does sound like Cher.

1162
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
 I'm sorry.

1163
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,480
 Okay, if you want to know how to impress Cher, all you got to do is imagine you've got a

1164
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,000
 mouthful of paprika.

1165
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Paprika.

1166
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,680
 We should say, we've addressed some housekeeping, reading a little stuff on the internet and

1167
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,120
 some confusion in the chat.

1168
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,640
 So I accidentally, when I uploaded our last episode, uploaded it with today's episode

1169
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:15,060
 number and so it came out as 1236 to the 1235 and then people thought a crazy trend was

1170
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,380
 happening because they said also we can't find another episode on there and I won't

1171
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,960
 even name the number.

1172
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:29,440
 And so the answer is one was my error and so you're not missing two episodes.

1173
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,120
 You are missing one.

1174
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,480
 Yeah.

1175
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
 And that's temporary?

1176
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,480
 Yes.

1177
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:44,360
 But a listener, just like Jason came on here and shared a lovely story there, if all of

1178
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,520
 a sudden his uncle was like what the hell and also he started ganging up on his uncle

1179
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,720
 on the internet then we would maybe try to like not be the cause of someone's –

1180
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
 Mitigate that.

1181
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
 Yeah.

1182
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,480
 So yeah, it turned out someone was getting picked on by jerks on the internet and so

1183
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,160
 we took down the episode to stop being a source of woe to one of our listeners.

1184
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,320
 And I'm going to edit that episode out.

1185
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,400
 I've got all the little spots to edit out.

1186
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,720
 I just haven't been able to do that yet.

1187
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,720
 I'm hopefully going to –

1188
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,440
 By the time this episode comes out, I'm hoping that that episode will be back up as well.

1189
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:21,600
 It will be back in the meantime, please help yourself to one of our 1,230 other episodes.

1190
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,280
 Which I am proud to say –

1191
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,120
 Feel free to look around at all.

1192
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,920
 I am proud to say we have stuck to it.

1193
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,680
 Our base episodes have been up and free and unpaywalled from the jump.

1194
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,680
 Yes.

1195
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
 I am really proud of that.

1196
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
 That's right.

1197
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
 Except for this one.

1198
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
 This one is behind the paywall.

1199
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
 It's not behind the paywall.

1200
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,680
 It's not.

1201
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,400
 Oh, you can pay me and I'll send it to you.

1202
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
 Oh my god.

1203
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
 Okay.

1204
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
 Yeah.

1205
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,400
 All right.

1206
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
 There's ransomware here.

1207
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
 It's also not even the –

1208
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,400
 @AudioguyJacob, pay me.

1209
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
 I'll just send it right to you.

1210
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,800
 It's not even the first time we did this.

1211
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,000
 We did pull down temporarily the one where I wasn't going to get sued by the people

1212
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 who made Marilyn.

1213
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 Yeah.

1214
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 Let me put that back up.

1215
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 Right.

1216
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 Yeah.

1217
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 That's fine.

1218
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 Yeah.

1219
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 These things happen.

1220
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Yeah.

1221
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 We've got the finger on the pulse, people.

1222
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 This is what you get.

1223
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 We caught up in the mix.

1224
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,880
 Sorry for misnumbering to the point of the fact that we did take down an episode.

1225
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
 So, yeah.

1226
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
 Right now, you're missing an episode.

1227
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
 I'll be back soon.

1228
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,880
 Two different things happened.

1229
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,880
 Yeah.

1230
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,000
 But the one we're listening to right now is –

1231
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 Quantity over quality.

1232
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 OG.

1233
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 OG with the zinger.

1234
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 I know.

1235
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 OG coming in hot.

1236
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 You're not wrong, Andy.

1237
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 We're not arguing with you.

1238
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 We're just laughing at the fact that you said it.

1239
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:39,360
 But there's also a reason why Subway was successful.

1240
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,640
 The smell and the quality.

1241
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,640
 Yeah.

1242
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,280
 They said, "We'd like to make this restaurant smell like the tunnel of the New York City

1243
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,280
 subway system."

1244
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
 Yeah.

1245
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,200
 And much like a Subway sandwich, we were also worth hitting an ICE officer in the face with.

1246
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,200
 Oh.

1247
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
 Hey.

1248
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,200
 You know, I had a good one on that one.

1249
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:07,680
 A friend of mine sent me one of those Gaston flag parodies with that and the sandwich was

1250
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,040
 being thrown at his face, you know.

1251
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,600
 And it's like – it said like, "Don't – " what is it?

1252
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,680
 I got to – it was like, "Don't sub – "

1253
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,000
 All I know is I'd rather have a dildo thrown at me while I'm playing basketball.

1254
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 Oh my God.

1255
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 That's outrageous how much that's happening.

1256
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,920
 And have a Subway sandwich thrown at me at any other time.

1257
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,920
 But it was like, "Don't sandwich on me," or something like that, you know what I mean?

1258
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,720
 And my quip was, "That guy should be referred to as Hoagy's heroes."

1259
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,320
 That's pretty good.

1260
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,880
 Glad we looped around to pick that one up.

1261
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
 I know nothing.

1262
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,880
 That's great.

1263
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,880
 I know nothing.

1264
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,320
 I laugh at the – you know, we all get spammed every day with people trying to scare us with

1265
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,480
 different bullshit things.

1266
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,160
 I never changed my New Jersey area code on my phone.

1267
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
 Right.

1268
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,160
 Right.

1269
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
 Why should you?

1270
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,200
 The spams are like, "This is New Jersey DMV," or like, "This is New Jersey Power

1271
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,200
 Authority."

1272
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,440
 I have a Louisiana number and it's the same thing.

1273
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,240
 I've got the 702, which tips me off every time these motherfuckers come call.

1274
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,080
 I'm like, "Well, you – I don't even live – I don't even – I don't even

1275
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,080
 know her.

1276
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,080
 I don't even know her.

1277
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,240
 That's my purse."

1278
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,160
 Lucy Darling and Sarah Soros play each other tremendously well.

1279
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,760
 Sarah Soros is a sniper.

1280
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,240
 70 minutes is the crowd was just loving and roaring with her.

1281
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,320
 Merch line out the door.

1282
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,320
 Yeah.

1283
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,320
 Oh, fuck yeah.

1284
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,560
 It was one of like a dozen shows where they were all sold out at the MGM in Brad Garrett's

1285
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
 old space.

1286
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
 Brad Garrett Comedy Club moved.

1287
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
 Yeah.

1288
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,160
 That's how out of touch I am.

1289
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,160
 And it's Tapeface's theater.

1290
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,160
 The new space is good, too.

1291
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,080
 Tapeface, who I have no problem with whatsoever.

1292
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
 Love me some Tapeface.

1293
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
 Yeah.

1294
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,080
 That's how I like Tapeface.

1295
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,080
 In his theater.

1296
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:00,280
 And it was once I was like, "Oh, she's famous.

1297
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,280
 She's hit.

1298
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:09,280
 I'm waiting an hour for her to say hello to all of her fans and then I can hang out."

1299
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,700
 And when I looked at her, I was like, "Hey, I don't know what this show is."

1300
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,700
 And she was laughing.

1301
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,920
 I was like, "It's not – I mean, you're not doing traditional stand-up.

1302
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
 You did two magic tricks.

1303
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
 It's not a magic show."

1304
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,600
 I was like, "You're really like keeping a bit in the air?"

1305
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,600
 Yeah.

1306
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,480
 You keep like five bits in the air and the audience loves it and then you bounce back

1307
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,760
 and forth between these bits and the audience just loves you for it and it's crazy.

1308
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,000
 But people loved it.

1309
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,160
 I mean, people were just clapping for her, cheering for her, laughing for her.

1310
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,920
 I was laughing hysterically for the whole show.

1311
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,600
 I just realized right now that I might have sounded like I was qualifying myself outside

1312
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,600
 of the laughter.

1313
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,600
 But I was not.

1314
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
 I was part of it.

1315
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,600
 I was part of it.

1316
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,480
 Also went and saw Atomic Saloon, so I want to see our friend Tyler before he departed.

1317
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,480
 Nice.

1318
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,040
 Where's he going?

1319
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,360
 He's going off on a Broadway tour.

1320
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,920
 Water for Elephants.

1321
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,320
 They went ahead and made a musical of Water for Elephants, which is an amazing book that

1322
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,320
 people love.

1323
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,360
 And then in it, there's actually a little person in it who's a real three-dimensional

1324
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:21,280
 character, not some magical elf, actually plays a dramatically awesome role in the show.

1325
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,600
 And then Tyler's getting to play that amazing role as the first Broadway tour, and I guess

1326
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,880
 that's worth doing.

1327
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,360
 Man, we got to get him back on again after this run.

1328
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,520
 We got to get him back on to talk to tour.

1329
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
 That'll be fantastic.

1330
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,880
 No, I'm so excited for him.

1331
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,480
 I ran into him happenstance at a bar the other night, and so we got to chat for about half

1332
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,480
 an hour, 45 minutes or so.

1333
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,240
 And I didn't realize he's never done a Broadway tour before.

1334
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,300
 He's never done anything like this before.

1335
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,000
 So this is just all new experiences for him as well.

1336
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,800
 I'm like, I'm excited for the show.

1337
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
 I'm excited for him.

1338
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,160
 Yeah, it's going to be great.

1339
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,360
 Oh, he has to do it.

1340
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,560
 And I was saying, obviously they didn't want him to go.

1341
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,520
 He's great in the show at Atomic Silver.

1342
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,240
 He really, really makes that role so special, and he's so good at it, and he's so funny.

1343
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,520
 He's so personable.

1344
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,820
 He really connects with an audience.

1345
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,040
 He really just is a natural born entertainer.

1346
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,200
 And it's really special to watch him work.

1347
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:28,600
 My family and I saw him do a random panto show in New York, because it was only after

1348
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,680
 I saw him in Mavericks that we were like, oh, we're in New York.

1349
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,680
 He's doing a show.

1350
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,680
 Let's go see it.

1351
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,680
 We kind of knew him.

1352
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,680
 We weren't as friends with him like we are now.

1353
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,880
 We just had to see him.

1354
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,880
 So we love Tyler.

1355
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,600
 And so it was really great to see him in the show.

1356
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,560
 And the last few times I've seen it, it's still great.

1357
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,560
 It's the best it's been.

1358
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,760
 Atomic Saloon is in the best shape it's been.

1359
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,760
 I think it's an awesome show to go see.

1360
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,600
 I'm so glad to hear that, because I really enjoyed the fuck out of that show.

1361
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,240
 I saw it twice while I was still out there, and it's great.

1362
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,400
 Yeah, the host now and the bits are just so much more present and right with the audience,

1363
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,720
 and then the kick-ass acts that are in it are well.

1364
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,280
 Our friend Christian is back in with his little dog.

1365
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,480
 He does the acrobatic act with the dog.

1366
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,480
 So good.

1367
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,200
 It's such a fun show.

1368
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,840
 I got hit with a bunch of bread rolls.

1369
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,600
 Oh, good, good.

1370
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:27,080
 I was the kind of tap percussion duo that's been there from the fucking beginning.

1371
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,560
 I was looking at those like, Jesus, wow, because they were back in from Vegas Nocturne.

1372
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,560
 That's right.

1373
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,560
 Yeah, Suzanne and Peter.

1374
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,320
 Suzanne and Peter just been in this town, entertaining like that's nuts.

1375
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:43,640
 And they do a bit where they do this percussion, but they're like the whatever the hillbilly

1376
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,240
 twins or whatever.

1377
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,160
 And he has a bunch of bread rolls in his pocket and you don't see it.

1378
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,480
 He snipes people.

1379
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
 He just dances around.

1380
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,960
 All of a sudden, boom, a bread roll just comes flying across.

1381
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,960
 It's great.

1382
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,600
 And right before the show, I was in like the back of the main little orchestra section.

1383
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,280
 And they're like, do you want to move up?

1384
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,360
 And in my head, I was like, how much do I want to get hit by bread rolls?

1385
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,920
 But I was like, yeah, let's let's go for it.

1386
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
 Let's go.

1387
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
 Let's get moved up.

1388
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,920
 And I got clunked, right?

1389
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
 Bread rolls.

1390
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,920
 Yeah.

1391
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
 Bread rolls.

1392
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,680
 Last time I saw it, your wife was in it and our friend, Matt Morgan, they were the duo

1393
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,680
 in it the last time.

1394
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
 Yes.

1395
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,600
 And so they got me up on stage.

1396
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,240
 Matt is also a very funny preacher and can't resist that, but he's basically the director

1397
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,240
 now.

1398
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,240
 Yeah.

1399
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,520
 But I saw Heidi host because I my wife was I haven't seen Heidi do it.

1400
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,200
 She's very funny.

1401
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
 It is different.

1402
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,440
 It is definitely different than Sarah's and everyone else's.

1403
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
 And it's really good.

1404
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,360
 We're talking about Heidi, Brooker Morgan, who we've had on the show with Matt Morgan

1405
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,360
 before.

1406
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,640
 And yeah, they are just a powerhouse in everything that they do.

1407
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,880
 Yeah.

1408
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,560
 But Sarah was not performing with Tyler before Tyler left.

1409
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,560
 So I went and saw Heidi do it.

1410
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,560
 Nice.

1411
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,560
 Yeah.

1412
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
 Kick ass.

1413
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,560
 That's good.

1414
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,560
 You've seen Sarah plenty.

1415
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,560
 Yeah.

1416
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:09,560
 And over over the Venetian giant Wizard of Oz display over there.

1417
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,160
 I have my tickets.

1418
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,160
 Now the sphere and Venetian are two totally different entities, right?

1419
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,160
 They are.

1420
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,720
 But I believe they have kind of a partnership.

1421
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:25,120
 Yeah, because basically just became like haphazard, like the only place to park to go to the spheres,

1422
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,120
 the Venetian.

1423
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,120
 Right.

1424
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,000
 And so the Venetian started charging like event pricing during sphere events.

1425
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,200
 Right.

1426
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,760
 Which is great for me because it has taken out the question.

1427
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:41,440
 So now I just pay the ridiculous amount of money to park at the sphere because it's close

1428
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,140
 and it's convenient because Venetian is now charging like ten dollars less.

1429
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,140
 Yes.

1430
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:53,660
 Well, that's that is worth that ten dollars to me to not walk across the city and get

1431
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,840
 to this event.

1432
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,200
 So I guess I'll just pay the extra ten bucks and not have to worry about it.

1433
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,840
 Thanks Venetian for being assholes and charging too much for parking.

1434
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
 Yeah.

1435
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,080
 I mean, it is mentioning that there's a place called Lambert's in Alabama, famous for throwing

1436
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,920
 bread rolls across the dining room.

1437
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,640
 Do you know, Matt, was that taken from that place or not?

1438
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,960
 Maybe I know that it was not.

1439
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,960
 OK.

1440
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,800
 Oh, yeah, because I know Lambert's and they have they have a couple of places.

1441
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,800
 They have one outside of St. Louis as well that I've been to where and they do they just

1442
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:32,640
 chuck like if you need a roll, you just like throw up your hand and like roll like roll

1443
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,220
 and they just chuck it across the room baseball style.

1444
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,480
 We saw some videos of that, Anne and I and we.

1445
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,440
 Oh, but I asked about that when that when the Atomic Saloon started and nobody it became

1446
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,360
 it became a running joke for Anne and I.

1447
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:49,680
 She ended up buying us big Lambert's mugs with the guy throwing the bread roll on it.

1448
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
 Home of the Throed Rolls.

1449
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
 That's right.

1450
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,680
 Home of the Throed Rolls.

1451
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,320
 Throed being the Throed Rolls the way they say it there.

1452
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,320
 Yeah.

1453
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,480
 So are you going to this Wizard of Oz show, Matt, or you just went to the display?

1454
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,480
 I have yet to see any show at the Sphere.

1455
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,480
 I don't know if the Wizard of Oz is even open yet.

1456
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
 It is not.

1457
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,280
 I have tickets to go see it though in September.

1458
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,440
 I think I have I think I have tickets to go see it before Scoopfest.

1459
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,440
 Yes.

1460
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,040
 I know it is opening soon and our friends flying out to come see it.

1461
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,320
 This is going to be a gigantic hit.

1462
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,480
 I think so, too.

1463
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:32,080
 I was just talking about this on another show the other day that this actually on on what's

1464
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:39,640
 the sorry Brian and Justin I just forgot Great Nights Patreon only section that they do.

1465
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,840
 Their bonus episode that they do.

1466
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
 The Bones.

1467
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
 Thank you.

1468
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
 Thank you.

1469
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,200
 So I was on the Bones with them and we were talking about that and that's what I was saying.

1470
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,520
 I was like this is they tried the nature video.

1471
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,520
 They tried all that stuff.

1472
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,720
 The thing to make money when they don't have the giant concert going in the Sphere and

1473
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,200
 I think Wizard of Oz is going to do very well in that regard.

1474
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,360
 And they're hiring live entertainers to be a part of it.

1475
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
 Yes.

1476
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:08,040
 And so some of our friends are getting really good gigs out of this as well.

1477
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,040
 Yeah.

1478
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,040
 Yeah, that's great.

1479
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,040
 And so it makes it makes me more hopeful about it.

1480
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,720
 Oh, and scuba nova girl is in the chat saying that that she saw the morning video on CBS

1481
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,080
 and it didn't look good.

1482
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:24,920
 I believe that because nothing is other than I think the movie itself.

1483
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,760
 I don't think anything else is done.

1484
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,760
 I think they're still creating everything.

1485
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,820
 So I believe that the advertising for it at this point would look but I think also it

1486
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:38,360
 is unfortunate that I think they are incorporating some AI gobbledygook into the side effects

1487
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,960
 around the giant screen kind of thing.

1488
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:47,040
 So I've seen some clips that because like there's you know, they're doing part of fucking

1489
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,040
 everything.

1490
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,040
 But yeah.

1491
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,040
 Yeah.

1492
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,040
 Yeah.

1493
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,040
 I was just going to be in there.

1494
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,640
 Yeah, I hear that that's not going to be the film in its entirety.

1495
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,640
 It's a lot.

1496
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,960
 I'm going into it with a I'm going into it with a positive outlook on it and I'm hoping

1497
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,080
 that it's going to be great.

1498
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,080
 Right.

1499
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,080
 Yeah.

1500
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,720
 And I'm not if it's not I'll let you know, I'm let you know, like, look, I'm not a big

1501
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,240
 Backstreet Boys person and I can't speak to whether that's a good good thing.

1502
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,240
 It's a hit.

1503
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,840
 I can speak to the fact that the Backstreet Boys are punching up like that was a way over

1504
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
 achieving experience.

1505
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,440
 I want to go see their show at the Sphere.

1506
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,440
 Yeah.

1507
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,440
 Yeah.

1508
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,720
 So I'm saying it's going to be a gigantic hit.

1509
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,760
 I don't know if it's going to be like my cup of tea.

1510
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,920
 I'm just saying it's going to be good.

1511
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
 I'm looking forward to it.

1512
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,920
 I mean, Wizard of Oz.

1513
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,520
 And I say that as as the Sphere exists as a black hole that is slowly sucking and destroying

1514
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,480
 every other piece of entertainment in this town, I can I can speak objectively to all

1515
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:51,000
 of those things that that giant snow globe is going to cause a lot of my friends their

1516
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,880
 jobs, so I'm only happy to at least creating a couple on the way out.

1517
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:08,160
 There's at least that because we've become a the town with the basic spheres becoming

1518
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,880
 slowly becoming Disneyland or Disney World.

1519
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,960
 Now, Metallica is the next one that's rumored, but more than rumored, I think.

1520
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,400
 I think they're they're they're aiming.

1521
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,480
 I think they are pretty strong, pretty strong.

1522
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,480
 Yeah.

1523
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,480
 There are so many more steps to saying yes to playing the Sphere, which is why you'll

1524
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,920
 hear so many more rumors along the way, and it's because it takes millions of dollars

1525
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:35,240
 on any artists back and our front end on the artist end, whether they take it from the

1526
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,520
 back or front.

1527
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,840
 Don't you worry about which end I'm on.

1528
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,920
 You have to invest millions and millions of dollars into the graphics that fit on the

1529
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,920
 on the sphere.

1530
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,920
 Right.

1531
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,680
 It takes a long time to get to your concert, so it takes a long time.

1532
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,680
 Yeah.

1533
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:00,800
 Guar show at the sphere would be in fucking saying, hey, did you see that they just created

1534
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,440
 I want to do a dinner show before all the concerts where they have bread rolls come

1535
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:12,360
 from thousands of feet away, every which way, just launching them to the fucking billion

1536
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:18,360
 dollar Lambert's dinner theater before any production of the Sphere every night with

1537
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,360
 Guar.

1538
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,360
 Yeah.

1539
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
 Yeah.

1540
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,680
 Guar is the band that would sing at the table while the devil dances on your navel.

1541
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,000
 They would be able to shoot fucking blood soup at you while you eat it.

1542
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 Be amazing.

1543
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,560
 Instead of instead of blood.

1544
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,560
 Hear me out.

1545
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,560
 Drawn butter.

1546
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,560
 Right.

1547
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:48,000
 You had me at drawn by just millions of gallons of ghee fired right at you.

1548
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
 Daft Punk.

1549
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,560
 That I can't believe that you just said millions of gallons of ghee fired at your face because

1550
01:07:53,560 --> 01:08:04,240
 that is the prize today for the winner of Jack versus millions of gallons of millions

1551
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:13,360
 of gallons of.

1552
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,520
 The hunt for balls so much.

1553
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,960
 We got an obelisk of it as today from Winters scoop.

1554
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,840
 This is the one where we have questions ranging from $200 all the way up to $5,000.

1555
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:34,160
 And of course the winner will be covered in the first question is $200.

1556
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,560
 It's coming to me first and it's true or false stars.

1557
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,520
 Nobody wants to steal this early so let's see what the question is.

1558
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,960
 Warning, difficulty steps up fast.

1559
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,960
 Okay.

1560
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,240
 Clint Eastwood has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

1561
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,240
 A, true.

1562
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,240
 B, false.

1563
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,240
 C, blank.

1564
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,240
 D, blank.

1565
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,240
 Okay.

1566
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:02,760
 Just to tell you how the game works, I have a 50/50 lifeline that I'm not going to use

1567
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,760
 right now.

1568
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,760
 Right.

1569
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,320
 I'm going to go ahead and just say true, A, true.

1570
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,160
 Oh, B, false.

1571
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,120
 Clint Eastwood does not have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

1572
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,240
 Does that mean that it never happened or that because those go in rotation?

1573
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,240
 No, no, no.

1574
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,400
 No, they don't go in rotation.

1575
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,400
 What?

1576
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,720
 Once you have a star, you have a star.

1577
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,720
 No.

1578
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
 Yeah.

1579
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,720
 You're kidding me.

1580
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,720
 Yes.

1581
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,720
 Yes.

1582
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,720
 It's there forever?

1583
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,720
 Yes.

1584
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,720
 Yeah.

1585
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,720
 The fuck out of here?

1586
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,720
 Ask Fatty Arbuckle.

1587
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,720
 It's still there?

1588
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
 Fatty.

1589
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,720
 Fatty, it's Jacob.

1590
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,720
 Hey.

1591
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,720
 It's Jacob.

1592
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
 It's been a minute.

1593
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,520
 How's your star on the Walk of Fame doing?

1594
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,520
 I'm okay.

1595
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,560
 What seems to be going on?

1596
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,480
 I was in the middle of eating a lot of food as I want to do.

1597
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
 Oh.

1598
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,160
 Oh, I'm sorry, Fatty.

1599
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,800
 I think I called the wrong Fatty.

1600
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,040
 I'm dipping all of my food in ghee.

1601
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,280
 Oh, never mind.

1602
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,320
 I called the right Fatty.

1603
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,320
 Yeah.

1604
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,040
 This is a PB in ghee.

1605
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,000
 Peanut butter and ghee.

1606
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
 PB in ghee.

1607
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
 PB in ghee.

1608
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
 Oh no.

1609
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
 Oh, I'm so upset.

1610
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 Oh, Paul.

1611
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 I'm choking on my PB in ghee.

1612
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:29,200
 I'm just going to reveal this true/false weather question and hope to move on.

1613
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,600
 Tornadoes have appeared in every state of America.

1614
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,320
 True or false, Paul?

1615
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,760
 Oh, man.

1616
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,760
 I'm sorry.

1617
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,760
 Are we boring you?

1618
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,760
 No.

1619
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,760
 I'm just trying to think.

1620
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:46,440
 You've got to define a tornado, sort of, but I don't know.

1621
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,440
 Let's hear you define a tornado.

1622
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,760
 I'll go false.

1623
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,760
 Let's try it.

1624
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,760
 That's true.

1625
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,760
 Ah, shit in my ass.

1626
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,000
 Boy, two questions that were 50/50.

1627
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
 We've not done well on them.

1628
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,920
 I don't hear a lot about Alaskan tornadoes or Hawaiian tornadoes.

1629
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,520
 Yeah, but I don't hear much about much.

1630
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:14,280
 Aside from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, am I right?

1631
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,000
 Alright, let's go for it.

1632
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,760
 Give me the question.

1633
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,760
 Let's see here.

1634
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,040
 How many movies have been produced in the Harry Potter universe?

1635
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,560
 Eight, nine, ten, or eleven?

1636
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,560
 Eight.

1637
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,560
 Eight.

1638
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,560
 No.

1639
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,560
 Eight.

1640
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
 What?

1641
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
 That's my answer.

1642
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,560
 I'll go.

1643
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,560
 Okay.

1644
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,840
 It's D, eleven.

1645
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,600
 I was answering for speed, not for accuracy.

1646
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,600
 Alright.

1647
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,440
 Five hundred dollar question.

1648
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,160
 We've all missed a question so far.

1649
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,160
 Eight hundred dollar question.

1650
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,160
 We suck.

1651
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,160
 Corporate history.

1652
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,560
 Oh, the Harry Potter universe has those newer movies too, right?

1653
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:58,320
 Yeah, the Johnny Depp ones that were big failures, the mythical beasts and how to find them up

1654
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
 your asshole.

1655
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
 Yeah.

1656
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,320
 Yeah.

1657
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,320
 Yeah.

1658
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,320
 Johnny Depp was in those?

1659
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,560
 Look up your butt to see a mythical critter.

1660
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,560
 Huh.

1661
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,560
 Yeah.

1662
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,560
 Harry assholes.

1663
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,560
 I mean, I did that.

1664
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,560
 The butthole you're finding.

1665
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,560
 Yeah.

1666
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,560
 Yep.

1667
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,560
 Let's see.

1668
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,560
 It's me.

1669
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,560
 Corporate history.

1670
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,560
 Anybody want to steal anything?

1671
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,640
 We're getting into some stealing territory now.

1672
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,160
 What is it called?

1673
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,680
 Corporate history?

1674
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,680
 Corporate history.

1675
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,680
 Nah.

1676
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,680
 No, not that one, Jacob.

1677
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,120
 No one wants to steal corporate history.

1678
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,920
 Come on.

1679
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,200
 What year did Wal-Mart start?

1680
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,720
 1968, 1969, 1970 or 1971.

1681
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,000
 At least the options are nice and spread out.

1682
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,600
 So if I know like a rough time that Wal-Mart started, I might be able to guess them.

1683
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,080
 My question is when will it end?

1684
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,080
 Am I right?

1685
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,640
 Talking to you, Boston Market.

1686
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,520
 I smell partnership.

1687
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
 I have no idea.

1688
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
 Boston Wal-Mart.

1689
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,520
 Oh, I can't pass.

1690
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,080
 I'm not going to use my 50/50 on this.

1691
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,680
 Come on, Wal-Mart.

1692
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,840
 I guess, you know what?

1693
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,840
 1969.

1694
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,840
 Nice.

1695
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,840
 Yeah.

1696
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,840
 Come on, Wal-Mart.

1697
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,840
 Sexiest year ever.

1698
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
 Fuck yeah!

1699
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,840
 It was.

1700
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
 It was.

1701
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,840
 It's so filthy.

1702
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,840
 I love it.

1703
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,840
 It's so filthy.

1704
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,840
 Filthy Wal-Mart.

1705
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,320
 Oh, now I'm holding onto control.

1706
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,400
 Actor origins for 1,000.

1707
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,400
 Actor origins?

1708
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
 Anybody stealing?

1709
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,400
 I'm super stealing.

1710
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,400
 I want all of your 800 points.

1711
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,400
 Whoa, shoot.

1712
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,400
 Matt is living on the edge.

1713
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,560
 You're hot with the super steal.

1714
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,160
 What country does Cate Blanchett come from?

1715
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,080
 Australia, the UK, Canada or America?

1716
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,960
 Australia, A. Australia is correct.

1717
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,960
 Wow.

1718
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,080
 And I don't have any points again.

1719
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,640
 It's just like the old times.

1720
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,640
 Oh, boy.

1721
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,640
 Arkansas represent.

1722
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,640
 $1,200 questions.

1723
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,640
 Drinks.

1724
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,640
 Drinks.

1725
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,720
 Oh, I want nothing to do with it because I know nothing of drink.

1726
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,720
 Let's see.

1727
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,080
 Which country consumes the most tea per capita?

1728
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,800
 The UK, America, Turkey or India?

1729
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,560
 Well, this is where it gets tricky here, right?

1730
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,880
 Per capita.

1731
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,440
 That's that magic word right there.

1732
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,440
 Yeah.

1733
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,440
 Per capita.

1734
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,480
 Who's got the more capitals?

1735
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,480
 Right.

1736
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,120
 So India is too populated.

1737
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,720
 It's just no matter what the tea is, it won't add up.

1738
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,400
 You are spilling some tea on that.

1739
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:26,680
 Sometimes I bet drink way more tea than UK as a whole, but I don't think I don't I don't

1740
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:33,760
 think per capita, right, because then we're I think everybody in the UK drinks tea.

1741
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,800
 A lot of people in the States drink tea, but maybe not everybody.

1742
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,400
 Actually, I'm going to say Turkey gets no respect.

1743
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,400
 I'm going with Turkey.

1744
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,400
 Yes.

1745
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,400
 Gobble gobble.

1746
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,400
 It was Turkey.

1747
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,400
 It's Turkey.

1748
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,400
 Look at you.

1749
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,640
 It's fire Thanksgiving every day with this motherfucker.

1750
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,520
 Can't stop won't stop.

1751
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,320
 Let's see 90s music.

1752
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,600
 And you want to steal my amazing amount of points.

1753
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,040
 I'm going to double down.

1754
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,040
 Paul.

1755
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,040
 But do I?

1756
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,040
 Yeah, I just did regular steel.

1757
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:11,620
 What is the most successful one hit wonders from the 1990s was the most successful one

1758
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:16,320
 hit wonder wonder maybe from the 1990s, baby got back ice ice.

1759
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:21,400
 Baby Macarena or Mambo number five, which is so strange because Mambo number one through

1760
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,640
 four is pretty amazing.

1761
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,600
 But no respect, no respect.

1762
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,640
 This is all of these.

1763
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,560
 I'm going to I'm going to go with baby got back.

1764
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:43,160
 It's my gut boom boom boom boom boom boom boom Macarena Macarena.

1765
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:47,640
 Your guts filled with regurgitated linguine mouth garden.

1766
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:53,320
 Paul got that wrong and it's back to 16 hundred dollar question.

1767
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,320
 American history.

1768
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,320
 Fuck it.

1769
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,320
 I'll steal.

1770
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
 What are you going to double down that?

1771
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,320
 How far are we?

1772
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,320
 Oh no, we're not close enough.

1773
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,320
 Go.

1774
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,820
 All right.

1775
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,720
 Which state was the last to declare Christmas a legal holiday?

1776
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:13,400
 Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma.

1777
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,120
 You know what?

1778
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,120
 Arkansas is a little slow.

1779
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,920
 I'm going to say Arkansas.

1780
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:25,080
 Hey, it's Oklahoma, Oklahoma, where Christmas we don't give a shit about it.

1781
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,240
 That's two attempted seals to try to wrest control away from Matt Donnelly.

1782
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,240
 That's right.

1783
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,400
 They've both been unsuccessful.

1784
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:37,600
 It's still Matt Donnelly's board to two hundred dollar question.

1785
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,480
 Body science.

1786
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,360
 You guys can super steel me on body science.

1787
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
 Up to you.

1788
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,360
 Body science.

1789
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,920
 Oh, oh, I can super steel body science.

1790
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,280
 Thanks, Matt.

1791
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,280
 I'll do it.

1792
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,280
 What the fuck?

1793
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,280
 All right.

1794
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:58,920
 What is the name of the process by which DNA is copied to produce an RNA molecule translation,

1795
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,880
 replication, transcription or mutation?

1796
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,840
 I'm a go with transportation.

1797
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,800
 Transcription C is correct.

1798
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,800
 Oh, shit.

1799
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,800
 Oh, shit.

1800
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,800
 Who's got that?

1801
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,360
 And with that, you just transcribed my points to yours.

1802
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
 That's right.

1803
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
 Yeah, you did.

1804
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,960
 You can call me CRISPR because I'm modifying your fucking score.

1805
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:19,960
 Boom.

1806
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,400
 There's three questions left.

1807
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,120
 Paul is now in the lead with fifty five hundred points.

1808
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,400
 Matt and I are tied at zero.

1809
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,400
 I'll steal.

1810
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,400
 Oh, no.

1811
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,400
 Oh, but you can't super steel me.

1812
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,600
 Three thousand dollar question, philosophy Matt is stealing.

1813
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,760
 I can't super steel.

1814
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:41,000
 Which of these ancient philosophers is credited for the allegory of the cave, Aristotle, Plato,

1815
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,640
 Socrates or Homer?

1816
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,680
 E, your mom.

1817
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,760
 Oh, that's right.

1818
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,760
 She is a cave allegory.

1819
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,280
 Sit down, mom's cave.

1820
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:54,520
 Do you call the come in there stalagmites or stalactites?

1821
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,520
 That's right.

1822
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
 I stalagmite.

1823
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
 You might get pregnant.

1824
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:05,600
 I'm going to fifty fifty at Jacob.

1825
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,600
 Oh, yeah.

1826
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,600
 Wow.

1827
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,080
 That got rid of Aristotle and Homer.

1828
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,440
 Now your options are Plato and Socrates.

1829
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
 Allegory of the cave.

1830
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
 Yes.

1831
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:22,080
 Socrates is Plato's prodigy, right?

1832
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,600
 I think it's the other way around.

1833
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,540
 Oh, Plato came second.

1834
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,960
 I think Plato was after Socrates.

1835
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,840
 Which had the barbershop playset?

1836
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,840
 That's Plato.

1837
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,840
 OK.

1838
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,320
 That's the one I'm familiar with.

1839
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,720
 The wacky hairstylist.

1840
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,720
 Yeah.

1841
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,720
 Right.

1842
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,720
 Right.

1843
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
 Right.

1844
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,720
 Right.

1845
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,720
 All right.

1846
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,720
 I'll go Socrates.

1847
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,720
 Socrates is incorrect.

1848
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,720
 It was Plato.

1849
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,720
 Socrates nuts.

1850
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:48,720
 Just like that.

1851
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,720
 Socrates nuts.

1852
01:18:49,720 --> 01:19:03,400
 Let's see Eurasian history for 4,000.

1853
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,360
 I am going to Supersteel.

1854
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,360
 Oh, no.

1855
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,360
 My money.

1856
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,800
 Eurasian history.

1857
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,200
 My specialty.

1858
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,920
 I'm always talking about Eurasian history, you know that.

1859
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:21,320
 I mean, every other night you're going to P.F. Chang's.

1860
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,320
 Yeah, exactly.

1861
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:30,280
 The Congress of Berlin in 1878 aimed to resolve which conflict?

1862
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:39,880
 The Russo-Turkish War, the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War, the Austro-Prussian War.

1863
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:45,680
 Well, shit.

1864
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,540
 I seem to have stepped in it.

1865
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,340
 I guess I'll use my 50/50.

1866
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,340
 You got this.

1867
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,340
 You got this.

1868
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,340
 Oh, well, you got a 50/50.

1869
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,340
 That's pretty good.

1870
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,340
 All right.

1871
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,960
 That got rid of the Crimean War, which is what I was aiming for.

1872
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,960
 That's good that you got rid of it.

1873
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,960
 Look at that.

1874
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:00,960
 So you saved yourself.

1875
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,960
 And the Franco-Prussian War.

1876
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,960
 That's out.

1877
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:11,160
 So it's either the Russo-Turkish War or the Austro-Prussian War.

1878
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,600
 War huh.

1879
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,940
 Good God, y'all.

1880
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,220
 What is it good for?

1881
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,220
 Absolutely nothing.

1882
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,220
 Say it again.

1883
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,220
 Say it again.

1884
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,220
 Let's see.

1885
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,560
 I'll say, you know what?

1886
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,520
 Those Prussians, they were a feisty people.

1887
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,480
 So I'm going to say the Austro-Prussian War.

1888
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,480
 Here we go.

1889
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,480
 Final answer.

1890
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,480
 Oh, shit.

1891
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,480
 Oh, it was the other one.

1892
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,480
 Russo-Turkish War.

1893
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,480
 It was the other one.

1894
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:41,680
 And Paul closing out the game.

1895
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,640
 Paul, you could double down.

1896
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,400
 If I double down, I lose everything though, right?

1897
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,400
 Paul's doubling down.

1898
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,400
 No, I'm not doubling down.

1899
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:58,280
 Which law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system, entropy increases over time?

1900
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,840
 First law, second law, third law, or fourth law?

1901
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,200
 I like that you just have to know the laws of thermodynamics to get the answer to this

1902
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,200
 question right.

1903
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,200
 First law of thermodynamics.

1904
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,680
 Shoot, this guy used to sing it to me in Olive Garden.

1905
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,680
 Now I forget it.

1906
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,080
 Yeah, that was everybody's favorite.

1907
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,080
 Well, they fired him.

1908
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,800
 The first law of thermodynamics song.

1909
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:22,320
 Could you bring us a basket of garlic bread and sing the thermodynamics song?

1910
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,280
 You got it.

1911
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,280
 You fucking got it.

1912
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,600
 The first law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases over time, but only in closed

1913
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,600
 system.

1914
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
 I've got a 50/50, so I'm going to use it.

1915
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,600
 I'll use my 50/50.

1916
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,160
 That got rid of first law and fourth law, so it's either the second or third law, Paul.

1917
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,000
 It feels like third to me.

1918
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,640
 Oh, does it?

1919
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,640
 Okay.

1920
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,640
 Let's see.

1921
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,640
 That's what I'm guessing, see.

1922
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
 Fuck my dick.

1923
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,640
 It's me.

1924
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,640
 Shit my butt.

1925
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,640
 Second law.

1926
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,640
 Ah, poop my ass.

1927
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,960
 I think that means that we all missed the question that we used our 50/50 life line on.

1928
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,680
 But I didn't lose anything.

1929
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,320
 That is the game Paul wins, but only with 500 points.

1930
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,320
 Ah, balls.

1931
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,320
 Oh, you lost 5,000 points.

1932
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,320
 How did I lose anything?

1933
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,320
 In a game that goes-

1934
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,320
 Did you lose 5,000 points?

1935
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,320
 Bullshit.

1936
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:14,000
 In a game that goes from 200 to 5,000, the score is 500 to 0 to 0.

1937
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 This is, that's why-

1938
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,480
 And that's from the winter scoop.

1939
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,280
 Obelisk is a great game.

1940
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,080
 This is why it could actually work on TV, probably.

1941
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
 Yeah.

1942
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,080
 People only give away 500 bucks.

1943
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,300
 Obelisk is our best, that's our best on-screen game for sure.

1944
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,080
 They're making a ton of TV right now, so it shouldn't be a problem to pitch this.

1945
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,080
 They'll play.

1946
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
 Yeah.

1947
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,080
 TV sucks anyway.

1948
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,080
 No issues there.

1949
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,080
 Fuck TV.

1950
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,080
 Yeah.

1951
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,080
 They're making a ton of TV right now, so it shouldn't be a problem to pitch this.

1952
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,920
 I don't know if you subscribe to the apps, but a ton of new shows are coming out left

1953
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,920
 and right.

1954
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,920
 Thank you for running that Obelisk.

1955
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,920
 That was a great Obelisk.

1956
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,920
 Yes.

1957
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,920
 That was Winter Scoop.

1958
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,920
 Thank you so much Winter Scoop.

1959
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,440

 So, while you're there, purchase your tickets to Scoop Fest.

1966
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,320
 Yes.

1967
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
 That's right.

1968
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,280
 It is coming up here at the end of September in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.

1969
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,000
 It's going to be fantastic.

1970
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,200
 It's going to be at the Orleans Hotel and Casino.

1971
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,240
 Get your rooms there.

1972
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,240
 Stay there.

1973
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,040
 You can just walk right down to the convention space.

1974
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,080
 Walk back up to your room when you need something.

1975
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,280
 It's really convenient.

1976
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,360
 It's really nice.

1977
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,440
 And the Orleans is going to give you a really nice room discount offer if you just tell them

1978
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,520
 that you're staying there for Scoop Fest.

1979
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,480
 Or you can use the code, Paul.

1980
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,480
 What's the code?

1981
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,480
 S-C-F-I-25...

1982
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,480
 C?

1983
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,480
 Yep.

1984
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,480
 C.

1985
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,480
 K?

1986
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,480
 C.

1987
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,480
 No, no, no, C. Yeah.

1988
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,480
 That's right.

1989
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,440
 S-C-F-I-25-C. Head over there.

1990
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,640
 Get yourself a cheap room at the Orleans.

1991
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,880
 It will be fantastic.

1992
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,960
 And if you don't have anybody to come with, it's great coming by yourself.

1993
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,960
 That's right.

1994
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,920

1995
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,920

1996

 Yep.

1997
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,920
 That's what I just found out.

 See you at the cone.com.

2003
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,240

 You guys are fast.

2005
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,240
 All the people that joined us in the chat, if you want to join us in the chat, you need

2006
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,240
 the link.

2007
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,840
 If you want the link, you got to go to our Patreon page and support us at any tier you

2008
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,000
 feel like supporting us at, either yearly or monthly.

2009
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,600
 Yearly will save you some jingle.

2010
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,360
 And getting on there will save you some jingle.

2011
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,760
 If you want to go to Scoop Fest, you'll get a discount code that will save you a good

2012
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,760
 amount of money.

2013
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,760
 That's true.

2014
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,760
 On your Scoop Fest ticket.

2015
01:24:43,760 --> 01:25:03,760
 That can be done at preachingfun.com.

2016
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,520
 Or if you got fired for singing at an Olive Garden, even though you didn't work at an

2017
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,760
 Olive Garden, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

2018
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:23,880
 That's fartsinabag.biz, that along with preachingfun.com, it's extra to our Patreon page, where for

2019
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,360
 as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

2020
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,360
 Thank you so much.

2021
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,280
 We love all of our listeners and supporters out there.

2022
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,280
 Yes, we do.

2023
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,320
 At least one of and maybe two of our listeners are getting married.

2024
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,120
 We had some physical Scoop mail that came in today, and part of the physical Scoop mail

2025
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,760
 was a wedding invitation that we got for Macy and Danny.

2026
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,680
 So congrats to Macy and Danny out there.

2027
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,960
 When's their wedding?

2028
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,280
 Their wedding is September.

2029
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:57,400
 Oh, it is September the 27th, 2025.

2030
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,400
 We are busy then.

2031
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,160
 I think we're busy, and it seems like they might not make it to Scoop Fest as well.

2032
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:05,040
 Well, you know, ship's in the night.

2033
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,800
 Unless they're getting married in Vegas.

2034
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,800
 That's true.

2035
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,800
 Boy, what a honeymoon.

2036
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,800
 If you're getting married in Vegas, come right on over to Scoop Fest right after the wedding.

2037
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,800
 Let's see the details.

2038
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,800
 They're going to have an open bar.

2039
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,960
 They're going to have a cigar bar.

2040
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:24,000
 They're going to wear formal attire, and it's going to be an unplugged ceremony.

2041
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,360
 That sounds really nice.

2042
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,120
 I will be there.

2043
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,120
 Wow.

2044
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,120
 Jacob, okay.

2045
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,120
 What a commitment.

2046
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,480
 I'm going to skip Scoop Fest, and I'm going to go to this wedding.

2047
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,080
 Brock, we've never needed you more, buddy.

2048
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,520
 I hope you're listening.

2049
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,520
 All right.

2050
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,520
 Thanks for listening, everybody.

2051
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,520
 Stay safe out there.

2052
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,520
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

2053
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,520
 We'll see you soon.

2054
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,520
 See you at the concert.

2055
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:41,520
 Thanks for joining us in the chat, everyone.

2056
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:19,080
 If you have a public restroom that you are in charge of, don't paint the floor so that

2057
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,080
 it looks wet.

2058
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,880
 That is off-putting inside of a public restroom.

2059
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,880
 It's gross.

2060
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,880
 It's really gross.

2061
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,880
 See ya!
