1

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Right now, I'd like to thank Jake Schneider, Jason Klepper, Jeff Harris, Jonathan, Lori Ellsworth, Leon Kassab, Malia, and Mike!

 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Great! Let's go!

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hello, from a secret location.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I mean, it's Jersey.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Right.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Oh, shit! Was that a secret?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Damn it! I suck at this!

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 It's time for Matt Maddenley's Ice Cream Social, sitting in New Jersey together!

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It's Matt Maddenley, Matt Donnelly, and Paul Maddenley, sitting in Las Vegas at Speed, check out the audio guy!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're PreachingFun!

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We're not in Jersey, but we can't say where we are.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We are sneakily outside.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Oh, that's right! You are post-Jersey.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We're post-Jersey, yeah.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 We're at something that we'll definitely be talking about in the next episode, but we are not allowed to talk about it yet.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But we have other things to talk about, which is like, Paul's really upset, so here, Paul, here's five bucks, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Keep that one.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Oh, it's just like really on me about those five bucks.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 He came at me last night and he's like, "Hey, you got five bucks for the vending machine, they don't have any change at the front."

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I'm like, "Here's five."

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And then this morning he's like, "Oh, yeah, I owe you five bucks."

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I'm like, "Get the fuck out of here."

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I told you last time I was also good for it, which I'm a man of my word.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I know, you're good for it. I don't, I'm good.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I just feel like it's been a subtext this entire morning, we just haven't, you know.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 If I don't have something to hold over your head.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Paul's just...

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It's acquiring interest.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I did scare the living shit out of Paul this morning.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Paul thought I died.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yeah.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Oh!

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So we had planned...

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Were you guys sharing a room?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 No.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 No.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Okay.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 No, that's a key...

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 In that case, I have even more questions.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 That's a key factor.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That's a key factor, actually, is that we are not sharing a room.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 No, we parted ways last night and everything seemed to be fine.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I went and got my sleeps on.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 We had said 10 o'clock meetup in the morning.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And I get ready, do my thing, 10 o'clock rolls around.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I look around.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 No Matt.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I go out to check the car.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 No Matt.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Okay, that's odd.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I'm chilling for a little bit.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 10, 15.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Okay.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I get on.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I text Matt.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Let it sit.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You know, nothing.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Don't hear anything.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Yeah.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 That's weird.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You know.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And I let it go and Ann calls and we're chatting.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And then it's 1030 and I'm like, well, shit, I better call Matt.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So I call Matt.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Nothing.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It goes right to voicemail.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I call him again.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It goes to voicemail.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So I'm like, oh no.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And then I look at the phone and I start looking at the text.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 He sent a text last night and it was in a chain text and he hasn't responded to anybody

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 else's stuff.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He hasn't liked anybody's stuff.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I'm like, he hasn't touched this in hours.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He's in communicato with me completely.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So I'm like, okay, I got to go check on.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 So I go to his door and I knock and I wait a little bit.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Nothing.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I knock again.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Nothing.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 A little more urgently this time.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The fucking tomb of Imhotep.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I'm like, well, I'm going to the front desk to report my friend's dead.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We were supposed to meet at 10.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It's like 1040.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 So I start walking to the desk and sure enough, I'm almost to the front desk and I get a buzz

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 on my phone and it's Matt.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And he's like, oh, I slept through my alarm.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Yeah, you fucking did.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 He thought I was the housekeeping again.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Yeah, the knocking.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I thought it was the housekeeper being like, well, my alarm isn't going off yet.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So the housekeeper is too early and I'm just going to go to the housekeeper.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And knock twice.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Hard.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Yeah, that's true.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 In the same bit.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I was expecting the door to open, you know, in housekeeping.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 All right.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So I put the door to open and just go like, no, thank you.

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 This is the door open, you know?

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Yeah.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And then it never opened.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 So I was like, oh, all right.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 The housekeeper took a hint.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 When my alarm goes off, I'll talk to the housekeeping.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Then all of a sudden my brain is like, there's no way I slept through my alarm.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And then I got up and I sure enough slept through my alarm.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Turns out when you actually only have three hours of sleep and then you go right from

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 the airport to Tierney's Tavern and then to, you know, two hours of comedy shows and then

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 drive a significant distance after that to go to a secret location and check into a hotel.

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 You're more tired than you thought.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 You're more tired.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Where is your out?

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It turns out.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Where is your ride out?

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And I could see, even in Paul's retelling of it just now, I could see how stressed he

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 was that he was never going to get that $5 back.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Exactly.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 That was the first thought on my mind.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I was like, I'm out.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Son of a bitch.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I'm going to have to get that $5 from the estate.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 This is going to be a huge pain.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 I promise you in the four minutes it took me to walk down the hallway, not even four minutes,

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 three minutes it took me to walk down the hallway.

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I'm going down the hallway through different things.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,500
 I'm walking towards the front of the gate and like I get to the second like hallway gate

139
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,000
 change and I just, my, my face just drops.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I'm like, Oh my God, this is it.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I was like, I was like, first of all, how am I going to explain this to Sarah?

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 How am I going to explain this to his kids?

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 What's my responsibility from this point forward?

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And then I was like, this can't be it.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 This would be the end of everything.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Not to mention the cars in my name.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Oh my God.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Forget it.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Forget it.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 All that shit.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I was just like, fucking forget it.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I wasn't even worried about it.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I was like, I was kind of going, well, I'll be stranded here for a day or two, but we'll

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 figure it out.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But that's not what's important now.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 What's important is my friend is dead and I need to attend to his affairs.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I'm going to have to adopt his children.

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I mean, I might have to, you know, move back to Vegas for a little while to help out.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Certainly, I'm sure that's where services will be held.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I don't know.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Do I need to contact Tierney's?

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Who else needs to be notified?

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Who do I notify first?

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Is Tierney's Bats official next of kin?

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Sarah.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Tierney's.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 That's the order that you...

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But no, don't act like that's some bullshit move.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 He knows like 85 people that work in that fucking building.

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's not far off from next to kin.

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 It is the right move.

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I think if I told the Tierney's second, that would have been totally fine.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It would have gotten out to the entirety of Jersey in like five minutes.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 But then, of course, then selfishly it starts to overwhelm me.

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I'm like, I'm just getting on my feet.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The house just got painted.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Jesus Christ.

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Just getting my income straight.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 This is one of the few outside gigs.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 This is because of our partnership that I'm able to do these things.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It's all, I can't fall apart like this.

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Collective president in chat is saying, you know, I'm laughing, but this isn't funny.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 No, me being dead is not funny.

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The amount of planning Paul did in four minutes is amazing.

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I was all the way.

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I mean, I was raised in a house of catastrophizers.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So, you know, that's where that's where my brain goes real fucking quick.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It doesn't take me any time to be like, I'm destitute.

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 The podcast has been to stop.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I don't know if I can even improvise anymore.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 We've already you guys have already made it very clear that you felt that I was very replaceable on this show.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 You guys already we've already done.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I mean, I've even done this before.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I've been the one to call and text Matt in the mornings when we're doing all these things.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And Matt's like, no, he's asleep.

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Matt sleeps through shit sometimes.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It just happens.

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Matt is a heavy sleeper.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 He sleeps through shit sometimes.

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 That's it.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'm a heavy sleeper too.

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I've got a point where I have to have my door propped open and everything.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 But in a hotel when it's a different place, I don't sleep nearly as heavy.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I don't have my white noise going like crazy.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 So yeah, when Matt's in a hotel and not near his kids, he does sleep heavily.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Oh, yeah, that's absolutely true.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 That makes sense.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Also, the night before I came, my cats were dickheads, right?

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So sometimes I've done things where I leave our doggy door.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 It's a cat door.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I have cats, but it's a doggy door that's built in our house.

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I leave our doggy door.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 We have a little slide and I leave it open at night.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Other cats have come into our backyard and sniffed around that door in the middle of the night.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And all of a sudden they'll be like a big cat fight.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And that's woken me up a few times.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And Sarah down stairs just yelling, you bitch, you bitch, you bitch.

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I had to get up at 5.15 to make the flight to Vegas.

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 OK.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And my cats woke me up at 4.15.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Ah, assholes.

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And then I went down to be like, did I leave the fucking cat door open?

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And I get up in a panic because Sarah gets up every morning with the kids.

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And so waking her up early is just a much larger mistake than me and my little flight.

226
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And so I get up right away to what I think is close the cat door.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And I came down and my cats just fighting each other.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 That's it.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 The door was closed.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 I did everything right.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 They just decided to be fucking assholes at 4.15 in the morning and fight each other.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 They normally get along.

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Yeah.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 They decided to fight each other at 4.15 in the morning.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And then I was up.

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Right.

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's like, that's it.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I got three hours of sleep and that was my day.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And so then I was off to the airport all day and all that stuff.

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So yeah, I was more tired than I thought.

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 My cats are dicks basically.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And then have you discussed with Paul what you're going to have to do from now on now that you have pets that do hate each other?

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 How Paul keeps all of his pets separate?

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Yeah.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 How you're going to have to start doing that now?

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I have to build some kind of like Panama Canal of fences and things in my house.

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 That's right.

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It really is.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It really is.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 It is a fucking lock system.

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Now here's the thing.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So before I left, we had to go take Giz out to grandma's so that she wouldn't be more trouble than Anne can deal with.

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So Anne's just got to record.

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But that was an extra trip that we had to do on and off.

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 When you leave town, you take one of the dogs to the dog sitter so that Anne doesn't have to deal with all the animals that hate each other being in the house without you there.

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I didn't know that.

257
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That is very sweet.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And Matt, I want you to know that I will not be taking one of your cats next time you leave town.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 You would love the Deeks.

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You would love Schmicky Deeks.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Come on, Schmicky Deeks.

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 She's such an attention hound.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's only a three hour round trip to go take the dog and drop her off and come back home.

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 It's really nothing.

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 It's really no trouble at all.

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Yeah, it just eats up the great majority of your off day.

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Especially because one of those 90 minutes is with a dog in the car.

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Honestly, we don't mind.

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 With a classically well behaved dog.

270
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 A dog that we talk about all the time how well behaved it is.

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 She is really well behaved unless she's around Adora.

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 That's it.

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 The shit of it is Adora and Giz are very similar in temperament and everything.

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And that's why they hate each other.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And they really get territorial around Ann.

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That's all there is to it.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 All I have to say is we had a really good show at Terry's Tavern.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 We sure as fuck did.

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 We sure as fuck did.

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 That was the main crux of yesterday getting to that.

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And we did it.

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And I'm very, very pleased.

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It was super exciting for me to perform with these players that I hadn't played with in a long time.

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I played with Didgeridoo in the past, but in a minute.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And he fucking brought the fucking fire.

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Everybody was just top of game, man.

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Everybody was really good.

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Pat Shepard drove from the shore.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Steve came out from West Jersey.

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Probably about 30 scoops came out.

291
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 There's probably about maybe 20 other people just from town.

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 One guy who read about Only Me being a magic show and was disappointed that it also had Dion Flynn from The Tonight Show.

293
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And Kurt Braunhauer and all this pesky improv stuff.

294
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 All this hilarious comedy that the entire room is enjoying except me.

295
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 This is a good sign, though, Matt.

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 This is a good sign.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That means that people are getting back into magic and they're taking it seriously.

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Because what the mind noodler wants are people that take magic very seriously to watch his act.

299
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 That's it, right?

300
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 So this guy is this douche.

301
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I'll just call him a douche.

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 This douche shows up and he's there with his wife.

303
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 This hero.

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 This hero shows up.

305
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 He's a douche.

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He's like, I'm not here because I heard you're doing magic.

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I'll be doing some magic for sure.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But this is more of like a comedy night.

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Now, like everything that I put out said random comedy night.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Yes.

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 That was the name of the event.

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Yeah.

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And it's an improv stand up and magic blast.

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Yes.

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Right.

316
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And so I know for a fact that I didn't overly emphasize that this is going to be a magic show.

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But I guess on Tierney's social media, one of the posts was like, it's going to be a magic show.

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Ah, gotcha.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Right.

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Well, let's be fair.

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 This was proudly displayed on the dumpster.

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Okay.

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So that is a banner they made just for the event.

324
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And it was located on the dumpster of Tierney's Tavern fence around this dumpster.

325
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It is a picture of Matt Donnelly in front of a banner there.

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 What does St. Paul's banner say?

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 What it says on the banner is.

328
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Join us October 23rd for an intimate night of my noodling with Matt Donnelly.

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It doesn't even say magic.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 It doesn't say magic.

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 It still doesn't say magic.

332
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Intimate night's weird phrasing.

333
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And it's brought to you by Guinness.

334
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Yeah.

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Guinness sponsored it, so I'm official.

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Matt Donnelly will fuck you if you come by on this night.

337
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And I laughed.

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So basically we said doors at seven, but that's just because I just wanted people in there.

339
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Because I knew that we had to drive a long time after the show.

340
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 So I was like, I'm going to, you know, I just want to get everybody in.

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And I was like, and I got up and I told everybody the whole situation, why we're there, why

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 this night came together, that two people were coming literally from writing for Jimmy

343
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Fallon and literally taking a car from the city to Tierney's to make it to the show.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I said, they're going to show up whenever they're going to show up because Jimmy Fallon

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 can keep them for as long as he wants.

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Right.

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And so I was like, we're going to do some improv.

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 We're going to have some stand-up sets.

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I'm going to do some magic.

350
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I'm going to do some magic.

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 It's going to be a cool hang.

352
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Right.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Get everybody on the same page.

354
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And so at like seven fifteen, we did an improv set with Paul, me, Steve and Patch, the four

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 of us, without Dion and Kurt.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And we really had a great set.

357
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It was really good.

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 The audience was just eating it up and laughing it.

359
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And we finished and the douche is sitting there going, I thought there was going to

360
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 be a magic show.

361
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I thought there is going to be a magic show.

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 In my head, I just explained this, actually, as a matter of fact.

363
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I was just on stage talking about this.

364
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I go, yeah, there is going to be a magic show.

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I was like, when?

366
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I was like, next.

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But he was the one tool bag in a sea of lovelies.

368
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 That's the other thing.

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Everybody was.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 We had a great night.

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 It was amazing.

372
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It's a podcast.

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I'm only talking about the one dumb thing.

374
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Right.

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Yeah, yeah.

376
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 So I go, next.

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He's like, well, good or whatever.

378
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And I go, I literally go, I mean, did you not enjoy what you just saw?

379
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And I say that because I was so comfortable.

380
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 The audience was roaring through the whole thing.

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It was just confusing.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So I literally was like, can we chill out?

383
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And I thought he was going to laugh it off.

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Maybe I'm interpreting him too hard.

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Maybe he isn't a douche.

386
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 At this moment of the conversation, how many feet from the stage that you were just performing

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 on are you?

388
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 15 feet.

389
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Yeah, great.

390
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Okay, okay.

391
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 This is not down the road.

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 This is not in the next building over.

393
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 This is next to the stage that you were just on.

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Yeah.

395
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And so I expect him to laugh.

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They'll be like, oh, yeah, no, that was great or whatever.

397
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And he goes, hmm, improv.

398
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And I was like.

399
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I was having a conversation with the scoop when I first got in there.

400
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 This is great.

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 When I first got in there, I was talking.

402
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And I'm talking with this scoop and they're telling me some heartfelt stuff about what

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 the podcast means to them.

404
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Great.

405
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And that motherfucker came in and inserted himself right in the middle of me talking

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 to the scoop.

407
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Oh, great.

408
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I'm like, asshole.

409
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And so from that point on, I wrote that motherfucker off.

410
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Right.

411
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 He was a shitbag.

412
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And I think he's come out to other events there that we've done.

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I don't think he was.

414
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I think I recognized him from previous things.

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I don't know.

416
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Anyway.

417
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Was it Brogan?

418
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 No, no, no.

419
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 It was not Brogan.

420
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Brogan was awesome.

421
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Okay, great.

422
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Full side note.

423
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Brogan fucking flew in from Scotland to see the show at Tierney's Tower.

424
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Insane.

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Insane.

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 That's insane.

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Yeah.

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Brogan's the best.

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Yeah.

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 They brought me.

431
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Carolyn and Paul came out.

432
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Yes.

433
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Carolyn and Paul.

434
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Oh, good.

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 They were very upset because they definitely had traveled the furthest to be at Tierney's

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 show of anyone.

437
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Right.

438
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And then Brogan torpedoed them.

439
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Almost.

440
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Not fair.

441
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Yeah, yeah.

442
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
 They let us know that they met at our second Tierney's event.

443
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,440
 That's where they met each other.

444
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,320
 That's where the connection happened.

445
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 That's right.

446
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
 I forgot about that.

447
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 Yeah.

448
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 So that was really sweet.

449
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
 And they're still together.

450
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,280
 I think so far that's the only successful coupling now.

451
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,280
 That's not dwelling on the past, Paul.

452
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,480
 It's focused on the present.

453
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
 It's not the only successful one.

454
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,200
 We've had a few successful ones.

455
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
 We've had some unsuccessful ones.

456
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,400
 That's also true.

457
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
 Whatever.

458
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,560
 But yeah, Christine came out and...

459
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,520
 Winner scoop successful in quotes.

460
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,760
 Carl and Amy showed up.

461
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Yeah.

462
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
 And...

463
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 Nicky?

464
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
 Nicky was there.

465
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 Yeah.

466
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
 And then...

467
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,640
 This is the part of the show where Paul names people he saw.

468
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
 Look.

469
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
 And then we get in trouble for not naming the people that also came.

470
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
 Michael Scoop was there, of course.

471
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
 Good, good.

472
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
 Yeah.

473
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
 Yeah.

474
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
 Tens of people were there.

475
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 And it was awesome.

476
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,480
 And what I really loved was at the end of the show, I came up to a couple who was sitting

477
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,760
 there at a table and they had had a blast.

478
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
 They loved it.

479
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,360
 They're like, "This is our first time we've ever come out to a thing.

480
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,960
 We just wanted to come out and see what's up."

481
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,800
 I thought there was going to be more magic.

482
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 No.

483
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 Where is the more magic?

484
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,600
 These guys were like, "This was the funniest thing.

485
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 I'm hurting from laughing."

486
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
 I'm like, "Fantastic."

487
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 This was very funny.

488
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,760
 It would have been so much better if there had been magic.

489
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
 Thank you for taking a chance on us.

490
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,720
 I got him a chip.

491
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,120
 We're Obelisk King people left and right.

492
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
 It was great.

493
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
 It was great.

494
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,800
 A couple came up to me and said that, "We love the podcast.

495
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
 We're going to head out."

496
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
 They said, "We love it tonight.

497
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
 We'll check out your podcast.

498
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
 We're going to head out."

499
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,880
 I said, "Oh, do you have chips?"

500
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
 And they said, "No."

501
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:59,240
 I was craning my neck for Paul to look at me as I went over and got two chips out.

502
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,240
 He's learning the ways of the Obelisk.

503
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,040
 Matt pulled his shoulder, pat himself on the back.

504
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
 Learning the ways of the Obelisk.

505
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,800
 I'll tell you who else got chips from Matt Donnelly last night, and that is the following

506
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 sponsor.

507
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,440
 Today's show is brought to you by Matt Donnelly's Magical Manual for Manipulating Matt's Cats.

508
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,640
 It's from 2024.

509
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,720
 It's from big, sexy digital nomad.

510
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,520
 Some of you may know that Matt has two cats, Shmeeky and Shmookey.

511
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,780
 Both of them are certified assholes, bird killers, and general no-goodniks.

512
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,720
 They will cause bullshit after bullshit.

513
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,640
 But if you have cats that give you trouble, Matt has a way to solve it.

514
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,480
 Yes, in fact, it's Matt Donnelly's Magic Manual for Dealing with Cats.

515
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,880
 The wonders of this book are that it can enclose said felines.

516
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,540
 All you need to do is lay it open on a coffee table, hanging towards an edge, where they

517
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,920
 are tempted to knock the shit out of it.

518
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,320
 When they come up to try and do that on the book, they will fall into a great abyss of

519
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,640
 a hidden compartment inside the tome.

520
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,960
 You can quickly slam it shut and you have trapped kitty.

521
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,000
 The book itself is just an animal trap.

522
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
 No pincers, nothing sharp.

523
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,120
 The animal will not be harmed, merely contained.

524
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,640
 So if you're having trouble with your pussy, why not lock it up in Matt Donnelly's Magical

525
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
 Manual?

526
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 Yeah.

527
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,000
 And you can use it manually.

528
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,120
 And our hay scoops at Checkout.

529
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,600
 There you go.

530
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,640
 Paul, I think when we left, you were listing off people that you saw yesterday.

531
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
 Okay.

532
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,880
 So then I saw Kurt Prowler and oh my god, Kurt's stand-up was hilarious.

533
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,400
 He really had me losing my shit.

534
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
 So fucked.

535
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 Oh, he's got it.

536
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
 He figured it all out.

537
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 He got it all put together.

538
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
 I think he's finally figuring it out.

539
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
 I think he's really coming.

540
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 Good.

541
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
 Good for him.

542
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 He's so fucking good.

543
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,680
 No, he was saying that he doesn't have to do stand-up as much because he got the gig

544
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:11,400
 working for Fallon and it takes up so much of the week that you don't get out.

545
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,520
 So he was very happy to be doing stand-up last night, but he crushed.

546
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,960
 He was so funny.

547
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,600
 And we were able to cajole him into playing with us for the second half too, and he was

548
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
 very happy that he did that and it was awesome.

549
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,680
 He was so funny in the improv too.

550
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,380
 So I just put some buttons on the douche.

551
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,480
 So I do a magic set.

552
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,120
 I thought it went really well.

553
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,960
 I really enjoyed the magic set.

554
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,000
 This was one of the better magic sets I've seen.

555
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I wish the whole show had been like this.

556
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
 No, he said nothing.

557
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
 He said absolutely nothing.

558
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
 No, he did not say nothing.

559
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
 He said nothing.

560
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,040
 He did not do all of that and did not say anything after the magic set.

561
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,200
 He did not say nothing.

562
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
 The only thing that was bringing...

563
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
 Come on, dude.

564
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
 I mean, everyone else having a great time, but specifically what brought me a lot of

565
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,920
 a joy was his wife was having a fucking blast.

566
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,120
 His wife was laughing at everything while he was stone-faced.

567
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,480
 And so I'm going through a magic set and I did a magic set.

568
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
 I did some cool magic.

569
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
 Matt, I believe that you did good magic.

570
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 I believe that you did really good magic.

571
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 Your magic was great, Matt.

572
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,480
 At this point, I'm like, what was he expecting?

573
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
 If this...

574
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
 What I'm doing, right?

575
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,620
 I did the fucking ring bit, the arm chopper bit, and the straightest jacket escape.

576
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,200
 And the ring ones tends to be most magicians' favorite little magic thing is the ring one.

577
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
 The ring one is an excellent one.

578
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,920
 The arm chopper is one of your newer ones and it's very good.

579
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,640
 The straightest jacket, a classic.

580
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
 It's got good comedy.

581
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
 It's got good magic.

582
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,600
 What do you want?

583
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,520
 And I was just like, did he want doves or a floating bar stool?

584
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,600
 What was he looking for that he needed that he was not getting?

585
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 He was looking for intimacy, man.

586
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 That's right.

587
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 He was looking to be intimate.

588
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,400
 Maybe he was just looking for just love, maybe just a human connection between two people.

589
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 Here's the thing.

590
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,000
 For those who were in attendance, he ended up being a focal point for part of Matt and

591
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,720
 Dion's improvised two-man set.

592
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
 So Dion Flynn, right?

593
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,080
 Dion, who plays Obama on Fallon, like Dion is a, I would describe a beautifully intense

594
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
 person.

595
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,640
 Like he does, he has no kind of aw-shucks-y bullshit mode.

596
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 He's only...

597
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 Oh, I love that.

598
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
 He's only talking real like all the time and that's why I love hanging out with him.

599
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,280
 Like he just, he just cannot, he does not small talk.

600
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,760
 And so for his bit, he was like, hey, everyone, I don't even know what I'm fully doing here.

601
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
 Like he came in like in the middle of my intro and he goes, yeah, I just felt like where

602
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,600
 you were in your intro, that felt like a good time for me to come in and sit down.

603
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,160
 So I'm going to start talking now.

604
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,400
 And he just kind of comes in and he makes the whole audience move chairs and like move

605
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
 closer and come up.

606
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Great.

607
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And he's like, we're going to go to different people.

608
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,680
 He's like, I'm just going to have you raise your hand.

609
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
 I might not have been calling you.

610
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 You might not even talk.

611
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,280
 And then he called on someone and then he did have him say something and goes, and that's

612
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
 all we're going to take from you.

613
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,120
 That's not to say we're not curious about what we're saying, but we're moving on.

614
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,480
 And he just, he just started bouncing around the room and we kept doing scenes whenever

615
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,720
 he felt like it off of information from the audience.

616
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,480
 It was just beautifully fluid.

617
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 This is great.

618
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 I loved us.

619
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
 Yeah.

620
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,640
 And so after we did a couple of scenes, he's like, I'm going to look for the most stoic,

621
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,800
 least involved person in the room.

622
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
 Right?

623
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 At that moment.

624
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,680
 Did you already know who it was going to be?

625
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
 Well, yes, I did.

626
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,360
 And then, and then he pointed to a woman and he goes, and that was going to be you, but

627
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
 then you just laughed at what I just said.

628
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
 So it's not you.

629
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,120
 And then he just goes, but you, you, you've, you've had no, no smile the whole time.

630
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
 And he points to him.

631
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
 You haven't looked up.

632
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,040
 Well, and then the answer is ask him questions like you went to high school, tell me something

633
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,960
 weird about your high school or whatever.

634
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,480
 And he, and the guy goes, I went to high school where we had to wear school uniforms.

635
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,360
 But when we, uh, joined the swim team, the first day we all had, we just swam naked.

636
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,280
 We were all naked in our, for our swim team.

637
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
 All right.

638
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,960
 They made all the boys swim naked for P.E.

639
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
 Yeah.

640
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
 Well, that's just going to increase drag.

641
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,720
 It's true.

642
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,440
 That's, that's not even good swimming practice.

643
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
 Yeah.

644
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,640
 That high school had the worst swim times of the state.

645
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,720
 And so, uh, but, but the thing was like, as soon as it was about him, he was fucking eating

646
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
 it up.

647
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
 Like he was loving talking.

648
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
 Oh, I gotcha.

649
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
 Yeah.

650
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 Yeah.

651
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 And I.

652
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 Oh, is that what he wanted from the magic?

653
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,160
 Did he want to be a helper for, for one of the tricks in the magic show?

654
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
 Maybe I looked out.

655
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,080
 I asked, I mean, you know, I use a lot of audience volunteers.

656
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
 He didn't know.

657
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
 Yeah.

658
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
 Yeah.

659
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
 Sure.

660
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
 Volunteer himself.

661
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,760
 But, uh, but I was like, this guy is like basic 20% of my cruise ship, uh, people.

662
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,920
 Guys a little older than me have a couple of drinks are like, I'm pretty awesome.

663
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,600
 Why don't, why don't you use me more?

664
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 You know?

665
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
 I am great.

666
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,800
 So we did, we did bits with him or whatever.

667
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,720
 And so, you know, at this point I'm like, fine.

668
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,280
 I'm done with the amount of attention he has.

669
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
 He is.

670
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
 Yeah.

671
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
 Yeah.

672
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
 We're, we're done.

673
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,720
 But Kurt goes up in a standup and, uh, in it, he, he, uh, sets up a joke about how terrible

674
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,000
 his dad is by putting them in the same category as Trump and like Pol Pot or something like

675
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 that.

676
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Okay.

677
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,160
 And then, uh, uh, that's, we actually identified maybe one of the issues why he wasn't having

678
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
 the best time.

679
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,240
 Oh, cause he's a big Pol Pot fan.

680
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
 He's huge.

681
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
 Pol Pot.

682
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
 Yeah.

683
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
 Yeah.

684
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
 That makes sense.

685
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
 He is wearing a Pol Pot 2028 shirt.

686
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
 Yeah.

687
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
 I should have noticed that.

688
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
 And Kurt had a dead canvas shirt on.

689
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
 So it was automatically like, ah, that.

690
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,960
 And then he did a bit making fun of Black Rifle Coffee.

691
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,760
 And he was like, he was like, good, cause we really need to know the politics of every

692
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
 product that we have.

693
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,960
 I'm glad coffee is finally letting people know that they're pro-gun.

694
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,000
 He read this hilarious email that he wrote to the Black Rifle Coffee Company and just

695
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,280
 at, you know, in this very, he actually, Kurt posed for the cover of one of Mike Sack's

696
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,800
 recent books, uh, called Passing on the Right.

697
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,040
 Have you seen that?

698
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
 No.

699
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,960
 So Kurt worked with Mike Sacks on this book, Passing on the Right, and I think Kurt did

700
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,440
 the audio book for it.

701
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:39,080
 Uh, and it's this very, uh, you know, like, uh, faux infiltration of the very right wing

702
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:47,480
 media sphere, but, but that's kind of what, the way Kurt wrote this, this, uh, he wrote

703
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,160
 a letter as someone who is a fan of the politics of Black Rifle Coffee and saying they aren't

704
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
 taking it far enough.

705
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
 Yeah.

706
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
 That's the premise of the thing.

707
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
 But he read the actual email.

708
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
 He sent Black Rifle Coffee.

709
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,720
 Black Rifle Coffee had a mocha flavor and he was like, Matt, a mocha flavor.

710
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,000
 There's a, there's a, yeah, there's a, there's a copy that has Kurt on the cover, uh, if

711
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,320
 you look it up, but there's a version that has Kurt on the cover, um, uh, and Mike Sacks.

712
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,720
 In the middle of this letter, our friend, uh, decided it was time to go and he left.

713
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
 Oh, was that when he left?

714
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
 Yeah.

715
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 Oh, hilarious.

716
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
 Hilarious.

717
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,000
 That's enough for me.

718
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Okay.

719
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Perfect.

720
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Perfect.

721
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Perfect.

722
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Perfect.

723
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Perfect.

724
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 He might've been a stockholder of the coffee company, I think, or whatever.

725
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Yeah.

726
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Yeah.

727
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Yeah.

728
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Yeah.

729
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Yeah.

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Yeah.

731
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Yeah.

732
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Yeah.

733
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 That was Ted Rifle.

734
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 He couldn't stand being the rifle butt of the joke.

735
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Uh, yeah.

736
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,160
 Uh, so, uh, Kurt was awesomely unapologetic about it.

737
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
 He was like, "Did that guy walk?"

738
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,160
 And we're like, "If he thinks so," he's like, "Okay."

739
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,160
 If I had known, I'd have been like, "Thank you.

740
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
 Thank you, Kurt."

741
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
 No, totally.

742
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,120
 Because literally, I'm, you know, I'm writing this because the podcast is just, it's fun

743
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,680
 to focus on this guy, but there's a very small part of everyone else was just eating up fucking

744
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
 everything we were doing.

745
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,240
 I mean, here's the, here's the other part, of course, we had a very nice contingence

746
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
 of scoops.

747
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
 Yeah.

748
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,560
 And scoops always elevate every fucking event.

749
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,080
 It was the thing of, I've been doing some improv now again, uh, in PA, and it was just

750
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,320
 so lovely to step on stage, throw out a line, and get hit with a round of laughter.

751
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
 Just like, boom.

752
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,400
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I'm here with friends and support.

753
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,840
 This is, this is going to be great."

754
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
 Yeah.

755
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
 You know?

756
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
 Yeah.

757
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
 It was really, really lovely.

758
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,880
 Which made it even worse later when he thought Matt had died.

759
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,680
 It did make it worse when I thought he had died.

760
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
 I was like, "Oh, fuck."

761
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,040
 And all these scoops, I was like, "Oh, it's going so well."

762
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 Oh, yeah.

763
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
 Exactly.

764
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
 Everything's going.

765
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
 Everything's starting to work.

766
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
 Wait.

767
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,520
 Oh, well, at least I got to see him one last time.

768
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,680
 I'm telling you, man, I went from zero to a bajillion in like eight seconds.

769
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
 Yes, you did.

770
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
 It did.

771
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,800
 But, but what would you, what would your assumption be?

772
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,100
 You're in a hotel.

773
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,600
 You haven't heard from your, you haven't heard from him.

774
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 You can't text him.

775
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
 You can't call him.

776
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,440
 And he doesn't respond to a knock on the door.

777
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
 And if I-

778
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,160
 Paul, this has happened to me.

779
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,520
 This exact thing has happened to me traveling with Matt Donnelly.

780
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,400
 I don't have to tell you what would have come into my mind.

781
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,240
 I can tell you what came into my mind.

782
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
 Oh, shit.

783
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,000
 My assumption was, Matt is sleeping through this.

784
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Okay.

785
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,400
 Well, that will be my default assumption from now on.

786
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 Raptured.

787
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,120
 It finally took today of all days.

788
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,160
 Oh, that guy was only off by a couple of weeks.

789
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,800
 If I had slept five more minutes and I would have been woken up by a wellness check, that

790
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,200
 would have been a very bizarre start to my day.

791
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,560
 I am so mad that the hotel did not come.

792
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
 Yeah.

793
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,720
 He got me before I got to the front desk.

794
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 That's all.

795
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
 Oh, I'm so mad about that.

796
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
 Because I've done everything in my power.

797
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,440
 I was like, text.

798
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
 Call.

799
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
 Call again.

800
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
 Knock on door loudly.

801
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
 Knock on door loudly twice.

802
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
 Matt's dead.

803
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
 That was it.

804
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
 That was it.

805
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
 No other possibilities.

806
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
 No other possibilities.

807
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
 Matt has died.

808
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:36,640
 My friend and business partner has passed away unexpectedly.

809
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,720
 I'll tell you who else was more concerned than you would have imagined about Matt's

810
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
 death.

811
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
 And that's the following sponsor.

812
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,320
 Today's show is, by the way, when we come back for the break, I had the voicemail Paul

813
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 left for me.

814
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
 So I'll play it.

815
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
 Oh, good.

816
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
 Good.

817
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,480
 I feel like I'm so stressed.

818
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,400
 Today's show is brought to you by Sand.

819
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 That's right.

820
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,160
 It's from Clever Scoop name from 2021.

821
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,120
 The product is sand.

822
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:11,640
 Hey, motherfucker, why don't you pound me?

823
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
 Pound sand.

824
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
 That's right.

825
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 Yeah.

826
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 Pound sand.

827
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
 Yeah.

828
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,760
 Sand in one hand and shit in the other.

829
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
 See what fills up first.

830
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,160
 Sand, you are pretty feisty.

831
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,200
 I thought we were going to get like a fine product here and I don't know if I should

832
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,320
 even give you any money.

833
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,360
 I'm going to silica slap your ass.

834
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
 You know what?

835
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,400
 I become with enough heat.

836
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
 What's that glass?

837
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
 Okay.

838
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,200
 Should I put that in one hand instead of shit?

839
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,240
 I'm just telling you to see through my message.

840
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,720
 Okay.

841
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
 Is it clear?

842
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
 Clear.

843
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,000
 Is it painting you?

844
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Yes.

845
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Sand.

846
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,600
 Enter Hey Scoops, check out grit.

847
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,160
 That ad spot was granular.

848
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,760
 It was granular.

849
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,320
 I got down to the nitty gritty.

850
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,480
 Oh God.

851
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
 Here we go.

852
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
 All right.

853
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,440
 So while he's finding that, I also texted Ann and while I'm texting Ann, I will tell

854
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,920
 you what else was going through my head texting Ann.

855
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:24,880
 I was like, because all Ann and I do in case you didn't know is the small times we get

856
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,200
 when we're sitting together and watching TV, I try to make it about what she would like

857
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,880
 to watch because I get to sit and watch TV a lot more time than she does.

858
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,120
 And what does she like to watch?

859
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,360
 True crime murder mystery shit.

860
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,200
 And so as I'm composing this text to my wife, I'm like, does this sound right?

861
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,960
 And could this come back to bite me in the ass as I killed Matt?

862
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,000
 So here's what I wrote.

863
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,080
 I wrote, okay, I'm a little worried.

864
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,840
 Matt and I were supposed to meet up at 10.

865
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,640
 I've texted and called, no response yet.

866
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
 Hopefully he's in the shower.

867
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,040
 And to me, I was like, okay, I think that covers my basis.

868
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,520
 But in my back of my head, I'm like, that could still be me just setting it up that

869
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,960
 I've killed him in the shower or wherever.

870
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,760
 Especially since you were actively trying to establish an alibi at this moment.

871
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
 Hello.

872
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,640
 And my wife, note the time I'm texting you.

873
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
 Exactly.

874
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
 Exactly.

875
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
 That's it.

876
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,600
 I was like, oh man.

877
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,520
 Hey Ann, I just wanted to text you and let you know that the last time I saw Matt Donnelly,

878
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
 he was perfectly happy and healthy.

879
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,640
 No reason.

880
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,760
 I really replayed the last moment of our last exchange where I told him not to get the

881
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,560
 Doritos from the vending machine cause they were stale and he laughed.

882
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
 And that was it.

883
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,200
 And I was like, is that going to be the last thing I ever said to Matt?

884
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,720
 He could have choked on a Dorito on a stale Dorito.

885
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
 I warned him against them.

886
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,680
 I begged him not to eat those stale Doritos.

887
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,320
 I did everything I could.

888
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,760
 I did everything I could outside of not lending him $5 to go to the vending machine.

889
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,960
 No, tell them what your vending machine selection actually was.

890
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
 Oh man.

891
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
 They had cans of you.

892
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,960
 He chugged a you-hoo at midnight and then was like, Oh, I'm not getting the best sleep

893
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
 tonight.

894
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
 What the fuck?

895
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,480
 I woke up at 7 a.m. with a huge fucking raging heartburn issue.

896
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,000
 I ate like a thousand tums.

897
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,840
 He tumbled himself back to sleep into a tongue coma and then I'm left here dealing with the

898
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:48,440
 dentist and trying to put my life back together like how many partners did I have to adopt

899
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
 his children.

900
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
 Here we go.

901
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
 He's playing it.

902
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
 Hey dude, it's 1030.

903
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
 Just trying to get a hold of you.

904
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
 Hopefully you're just taking a shower or whatever.

905
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
 I'm in my room.

906
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
 Give me a shower.

907
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
 Bye.

908
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:06,440
 That doesn't sound like a concerned person at all.

909
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,200
 He's not, I'm trying to sound as authentic as I can and not be pieces of your murder.

910
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,560
 He's establishing his alibi, Matt.

911
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,120
 That totally sounds much more of an alibi establishing voicemail than a voicemail by

912
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
 anyone concerned.

913
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
 That's what I did.

914
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,480
 There is no concern outside of Paul going to prison in that voicemail.

915
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,800
 The other side of that is, Oh man, I hope you're okay.

916
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,440
 And that reads of, I know you're dead because I killed you because I've watched all these

917
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
 shows and that's what they are.

918
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,120
 It's all these guys calling them over there, I don't know what happened to my wife.

919
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,960
 I just came home and there's blood everywhere.

920
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,840
 This is a fucking Karen Reed reverse logic shit happening right here.

921
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
 I am.

922
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,760
 I have reverse logic myself into the place where I had to be.

923
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,560
 That was me being nonchalant.

924
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,280
 That was you with the prosecutor going, does this sound like a man concerned for his friend

925
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
 who doesn't know his whereabouts?

926
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
 Sure.

927
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
 Hope everything's all right there, pal.

928
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,200
 Hope you're just in the shower and just taking a little extra time with yourself this morning.

929
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,000
 Yeah, I know we're supposed to get together at 10, but hey, it's 10.30.

930
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 You do what you want to do.

931
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,680
 And I hang up and I'm like, Dear God, they know, they know.

932
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,120
 I'm like, fucking, what's his name in the bathroom?

933
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,720
 Oh, the burping, they know.

934
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,960
 But that's the fucked up thing.

935
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
 I didn't kill him.

936
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,760
 As you can see, I didn't actually have anything to do with his not death and yet the Catholic

937
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,640
 guilt in me puts me already into the place of on death row.

938
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
 I am already.

939
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:46,560
 And if you had murdered, if you had been blamed for the murder of New Jersey's favorite son,

940
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
 who knows?

941
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
 That's right.

942
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,480
 Some of the chat scooping over girl wants to know if it's actually me, an imposter

943
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,240
 Paul has founded up here and that's going to put me on the show.

944
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 That's right.

945
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
 We're only seeing Matt digitally.

946
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
 Paul just because I have Sora.

947
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,880
 This could be just an elaborate AI thing.

948
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:14,480
 Paul is weirdly better at AI than any of us would have guessed.

949
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,280
 Jeff Loomis has taken the voicemail should have been, hey dipshit, did you oversleep?

950
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,760
 I've been waiting for an hour for your lazy ass.

951
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
 It's my alibi voicemail.

952
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:31,640
 To be fair, it only been a half an hour and I, I try to be, I try to be really, I don't

953
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
 know.

954
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 I try.

955
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,760
 I'm just caught in this shit.

956
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,200
 I'm trying not to be mean.

957
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,480
 I'm trying not to be.

958
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
 I, yeah.

959
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
 You know?

960
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
 Yeah.

961
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,600
 All, all, you know, all, all bits aside, I feel terrible that I scared the shit out of

962
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
 Paul.

963
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
 I feel terrible.

964
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 I feel really bad about it.

965
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
 Not me.

966
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
 Not me.

967
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 I mean, it made for good.

968
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
 I'm very happy about it.

969
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,360
 And I definitely, that's absolutely my second thought.

970
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,720
 One is I felt horrible that I scared Paul like that.

971
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,040
 And then the second was like, well, we know what's kicking off the pot.

972
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 Podcasted birdies.

973
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
 Winter scoop podcasted birdies.

974
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
 Ah, Jesus.

975
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
 Oh shit.

976
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
 So yeah.

977
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
 Don't want the angry mess to play an open court.

978
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
 That's exactly right.

979
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
 You know what I mean?

980
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 Where the fuck are you, man?

981
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 I just killed you.

982
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
 I mean, I just saw you like five seconds ago and I'm like, I don't even know what's going

983
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
 on.

984
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 I mean, I just saw you like five seconds ago and I'm like, I don't even know what's going

985
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
 on.

986
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
 I just killed you.

987
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 I mean, I just killed you.

988
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
 I mean, I just killed you.

989
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,840
 I mean, I just saw you like five seconds ago after the bullshit from last night.

990
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,880
 You're going to fucking bullshit me again today.

991
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
 Fuck you.

992
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,640
 After the nonsense you pulled yesterday, you're going to pull this now?

993
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,440
 You son of a bitch.

994
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
 Shit.

995
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
 Oh man.

996
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,720
 No, other than that, I got to show Paul all around Newark on the way to the show.

997
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,320
 It was a cavalcade of Matt's old haunts and places that he hung out.

998
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,880
 I did get to point out the stuff.

999
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,000
 We drove past the Starbucks I worked at where I did all my bits.

1000
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,800
 I learned where the origin of the clackity clack crab man came from.

1001
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,520
 And also, Pat, who happened to improvise with us, when we were driving in, we went past

1002
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
 the bowling lane.

1003
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,160
 And he goes, "Hey, that bowling lane," or not Pat, Doug, we were driving past the bowling

1004
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,560
 lane, Matt goes, "Oh, that bowling lane we used to go to a lot and one time my friend

1005
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,440
 Doug wore some shitty shoes to the bowling lane, rented out the shoes and just kept the

1006
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
 rented bowling shoes."

1007
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
 He didn't go back for his sneakers.

1008
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
 He just kept the bowling shoes and left.

1009
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
 He left his sneakers.

1010
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,640
 And then we met the guy who actually did it and he's like, "I think there's two of those."

1011
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,920
 So that was pretty funny.

1012
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,960
 I definitely still have the pair of bowling shoes that I stole from a bowling alley in

1013
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
 college.

1014
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
 There you go.

1015
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,840
 One of our bartenders was Grace Tierney.

1016
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
 Whoa.

1017
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
 Yes.

1018
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,960
 Well, the real reason everyone was there.

1019
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
 Lineage.

1020
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
 No.

1021
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,880
 He was like, "I used to watch you clean ashtrays when you were eight years old and now you're

1022
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
 old enough."

1023
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,600
 Which is the job that all eight-year-olds should be doing, starting to run the joint.

1024
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
 She is indeed.

1025
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,440
 She is the inheritor of the crown.

1026
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,960
 She is slowly and surely running Tierney's Tavern and was the bartender for our event

1027
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,440
 and that made me feel old as hell, but also pretty awesome.

1028
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
 Billy Tierney came out.

1029
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,680
 It was so great to see Billy again and his wife as well.

1030
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,040
 They had a great time and just so nice.

1031
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,520
 I mean, Tierney's ... And I had a fucking burger right from the jump.

1032
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
 We all got fucking ...

1033
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
 Can't smash burger, baby.

1034
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
 Can't smash burger.

1035
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
 We all got can't smashed.

1036
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
 God damn.

1037
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
 It was a good hamburger.

1038
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
 It was a good burger.

1039
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
 God damn.

1040
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
 It was good.

1041
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
 It was good.

1042
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,140
 It was the first thing I'd eaten all day and it was just really fucking good.

1043
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,140
 Really good.

1044
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
 Ugh.

1045
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
 Yeah.

1046
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
 Other people sat down.

1047
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,500
 They were like, "What are you looking at?

1048
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
 You're getting a bacon cheeseburger.

1049
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 I don't know what you're ... "

1050
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
 Yeah.

1051
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
 Yeah.

1052
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
 Bacon cheeseburger.

1053
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
 That was it.

1054
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
 We ordered like six of them.

1055
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
 Boom.

1056
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
 They were all perfect.

1057
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
 Ugh.

1058
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,500
 So good.

1059
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
 So fun.

1060
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
 Do they still use the same can?

1061
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
 Yeah, which is unfortunate.

1062
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
 Yeah.

1063
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
 That is disgusting.

1064
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
 It is an awful ...

1065
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,100
 It's the same nasty old can of green beans that smashes the burgers.

1066
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,820
 It is long expired.

1067
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
 Yeah.

1068
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,820
 It's funny.

1069
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,300
 It is funny that I make burgers for my boys at home now because they now are old enough

1070
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,820
 that they appreciate a better burger.

1071
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,820
 So I do it.

1072
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,700
 I make a proper hand patty for them and it is funny.

1073
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,540
 It involves me scouring our kitchen for the largest can I can find that I'm like, "Wait.

1074
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,860
 I got a can smash it.

1075
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,780
 How do I do this?"

1076
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,700
 You don't just have a smasher?

1077
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
 I don't.

1078
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,700
 I should have a smasher.

1079
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,700
 Yeah.

1080
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,700
 What products ... What do I search for on Amazon to get a smasher?

1081
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
 Smash burger smasher.

1082
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,700
 I don't know.

1083
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
 I have one.

1084
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,700
 I'll send you a link.

1085
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
 Smash burger smasher, I think.

1086
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
 Yeah.

1087
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,700
 I think so.

1088
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,700
 But it is a key.

1089
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
 It is key to how the burger cooks.

1090
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,180
 You want the core more tightly knit than the outside of the burger.

1091
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,180
 Mm-hmm.

1092
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
 But ...

1093
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
 Oh, yeah.

1094
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,700
 There was ... There's something about ... That place just warms my heart.

1095
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,420
 The whole place, yeah, it just feels good.

1096
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,300
 Climbing up the stairs felt like my grandma's place.

1097
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,300
 The smells.

1098
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
 Yes.

1099
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
 A little musty.

1100
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,300
 Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
 It's kind of great.

1102
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,300
 Yeah.

1103
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,300
 Yeah.

1104
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,300
 It's not dirty.

1105
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,300
 It's just lived in.

1106
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,300
 It's fucking great.

1108
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,300
 The place is just awesome.

1109
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
 It's just casual.

1110
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,300
 Oh, yes.

1111
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,460
 It was just like ... Yeah.

1112
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
 They came up.

1113
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,820
 We all just started putting the stools down.

1114
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,820
 We all put the chairs where we wanted.

1115
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,820
 Yeah.

1116
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,820
 That's great.

1117
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,860
 The chairs, everybody helping out, cleaning up when we're done.

1118
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,460
 It was super fun.

1119
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,460
 Mm-hmm.

1120
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:43,020
 How many of the guest improvisers came in that really got obsessed with the chair placement

1122
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:49,420
 for the audience and really spent a very long time sorting all those chairs out?

1123
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
 No.

1124
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,420
 None.

1125
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,420
 None.

1126
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
 Oh, weird.

1127
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,420
 Weird.

1128
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,420
 Yeah, yeah.

1129
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,420
 No, no.

1130
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,420
 It was great, man.

1131
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,420
 It was funny.

1132
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,140
 Because he and I just did the Improv Jam reunion last weekend together.

1133
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
 Oh, right.

1134
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
 Sure.

1135
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
 Yeah.

1136
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:17,500
 So we were 16, 17, 6, 7, and it was funny because Pat and I left that show and we became

1137
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,900
 long form people, right?

1138
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
 Yes.

1139
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,300
 So Pat was just like, after the show, was like, "God, that was so much more fun to do

1140
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,900
 the long form man and then play and then do moving bodies and a couple of space jumps

1141
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,900
 and everything else."

1142
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,900
 Oh, right.

1143
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
 He was more in heaven than ever.

1144
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,340
 He had some really great moves too.

1145
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,340
 He was really solid.

1146
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
 Oh, he was.

1147
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,580
 And Pat's still, there's a legendary group called the Baldwin's that still perform at

1148
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,580
 the pit.

1149
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,580
 He's still out there doing it.

1150
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,980
 And he still goes into the city for that show, and they've been together forever.

1151
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,020
 Well, you can tell he's got the chops.

1152
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,020
 Yeah.

1153
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,660
 He wasn't rusty at all.

1154
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,660
 Yeah.

1155
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,660
 Nobody felt rusty at all.

1156
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,660
 It was great.

1157
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,660
 No, it was really, really fun.

1158
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,660
 Really fun.

1159
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,180
 Jeff Loomis in the chat wants to know, "What is the secret to keeping it a cool hang and

1160
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,380
 repelling the angry, trouble-making drunks?"

1161
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,020
 I think it's the second floor.

1162
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:12,020
 Well, the second floor was certainly helped for our gathering because Kurt made the observation

1163
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:17,780
 when he came in the door at 745, people were just yelling at each other.

1164
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,780
 Downstairs.

1165
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,780
 Yeah.

1166
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,780
 You guys have like an angry conversation.

1167
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,820
 And he said, "Fuck you, and fuck everyone you know."

1168
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,820
 Or something like that.

1169
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,500
 You see, second floor is where it's at.

1170
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
 Second floor is where it is.

1171
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
 Kurt was just like, "Ternies goes hard.

1172
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,180
 It is 745.

1173
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,700
 You guys are already way into your cups.

1174
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
 This is shit."

1175
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
 Just mad.

1176
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:43,380
 I would say, honestly, the stairs together upstairs are steep and creaky.

1177
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,380
 Yeah.

1178
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,980
 Like there's a banister, but the banister's almost at your knee.

1179
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,980
 The banister's almost at your knee.

1180
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,980
 Yeah.

1181
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
 Like you can't quite use the banister.

1182
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,700
 I remember that banister.

1183
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,060
 That banister is the most likely thing to cause a fall in that building, is that banister

1184
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,060
 on those stairs.

1185
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,980
 Well, it's definitely a drunk repellent.

1186
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,980
 That's for sure.

1187
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,980
 Yeah.

1188
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,980
 Yeah.

1189
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,980
 So I think a drunk tries to go upstairs, like, "What's going on?"

1190
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,900
 And like halfway he goes like, "This is a mistake.

1191
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
 I might not return."

1192
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,900
 And they turned around.

1193
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,900
 I can't go any further.

1194
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:19,860
 But I told you when I was a part time there, it is literally the town's tavern.

1195
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:27,540
 So like you can't get 86th there because someone from your family will tell you to meet you

1196
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,660
 there in a few months.

1197
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,620
 And so you can't be like, "Sorry, dad, I've been 86th from Tierney's."

1198
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,620
 Like that can't happen.

1199
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,620
 No, no, no.

1200
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,620
 On the other side of it, you don't want to show your ass in front of the whole community.

1201
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1202
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,620
 That's it.

1203
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,020
 I was going to say it's self-policing a little bit.

1204
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,020
 And yeah.

1205
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:48,220
 And I feel like Tierney's also knows that if they start 86ing everybody who acts like

1206
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,540
 an asshole, that's just not going to work either.

1207
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,340
 And also, I guess another thing is it's a fancy town.

1208
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,860
 I think if it was a town tavern in a dump, I think there'd be maybe like more problems.

1209
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:08,060
 But it is really, really Tierney's is a blight on the otherwise really pinkies out fancy

1210
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,860
 pants town that Montclair is.

1211
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,580
 We made a turn down one street.

1212
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,580
 Hold on.

1213
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,580
 I've got Billy Tierney on the line.

1214
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,180
 He just wanted me to write that down for the billboard.

1215
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,260
 Tierney's is a blight on the otherwise fancy town.

1216
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:28,540
 No, but we made a turn and we took this road and all of a sudden this street was multi-million

1217
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,940
 dollar mansions with Halloween decorations.

1218
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,980
 You know those giant skeletons, Jacob?

1219
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,980
 Oh yeah, like the Home Depot huge ones.

1220
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:37,980
 Yeah.

1221
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:43,940
 This house had two of them plus one coming out of the ground, two giant skeletons.

1222
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,940
 Highfalutin.

1223
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,340
 The giant house is also on giant properties.

1224
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,340
 Yeah.

1225
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,420
 And the houses were so big, the giant skeletons didn't look that big.

1226
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,420
 I was like, not only...

1227
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:57,260
 The nice thing about those houses is they're surprisingly affordable.

1228
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,900
 Any of us could buy any of those houses at any moment.

1229
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
 No, I really...

1230
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,300
 I don't think we can afford the landscaping.

1231
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,300
 No.

1232
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
 That's true.

1233
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,300
 It was insane.

1234
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,020
 I was just looking at these giant properties and I was like, "Man, just what they charged

1235
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,660
 to mow the lawn here must be astronomical."

1236
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,660
 I was just...

1237
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,660
 I was flabbergasted.

1238
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:20,220
 Good God, we drove by billions of dollars worth of real estate.

1239
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,580
 Billions of dollars worth of real estate.

1240
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,220
 That was the strangest thing, right, because Tierney's is just on the edge of town.

1241
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,080
 Yeah, and then Tierney's ain't far from that, yeah.

1242
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,580
 And then Montclair State's up the ways.

1243
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,740
 And to me, even when I went to college there, it was so strange that you went from Montclair

1244
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:41,460
 State past this beautiful giant houses that are jaw-dropping to get to town.

1245
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,760
 And you're like, "It's so strange that the university's on the high side of the Ritzy

1246
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,180
 area, usually the university's on the edge of the downtown or dark side of town, right?"

1247
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,180
 Yeah.

1248
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,180
 Whatever.

1249
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,700
 But so, yeah, that's also part of the equation.

1250
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,700
 Is that one of those things?

1251
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,940
 I wonder if it's one of those things where somebody who had some property left it to

1252
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,980
 the university or something like that.

1253
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,980
 Yeah.

1254
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,340
 Scoop and Overgirl says, "McMansions."

1255
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,580
 No, these were not McMansions.

1256
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,340
 These are old houses.

1257
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,660
 These are regular mansions.

1258
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,180
 And they're all unique in their architecture.

1259
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,180
 Exactly.

1260
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,180
 They're not so...

1261
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,180
 That's great.

1262
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,180
 Yeah, that's really great.

1263
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,180
 No, no, no, no.

1264
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,300
 You go by a Tudor to a mid-century modern and just huge.

1265
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:37,620
 And probably, I would say, 80% of them 40-plus years old, maybe more.

1266
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,780
 This is an old...

1267
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,780
 It was old.

1268
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,780
 Probably, yeah.

1269
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,780
 Yeah.

1270
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,260
 Probably 40, 50 years old, most of them.

1271
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,260
 Yeah.

1272
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,300
 So it was not a McMansion-type situation.

1273
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:54,040
 Speaking of 12-foot skeletons, when I came home from my three weeks on the road, my children

1274
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,980
 and my wife had decorated our house for Halloween.

1275
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,980
 Ah!

1276
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,980
 Good.

1277
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,660
 And we have a zip line on our little driveway.

1278
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,040
 Of course.

1279
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,740
 We always, the second year in a row, we strap a skeleton, like a six-foot skeleton, to the

1280
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,860
 zip line, as if he's zip lining.

1281
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,860
 Perfect.

1282
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:19,980
 But I pulled in, and there was a 12-foot giant skeleton taking up basically our entire front

1283
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,980
 yard.

1284
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,180
 Did Sarah get the skeleton?

1285
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,180
 Yes.

1286
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,180
 And I laughed.

1287
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,180
 And I said...

1288
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,580
 They basically warned me, like, "When you get home, you'll notice a new Halloween decoration."

1289
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,980
 And I came in, and I was like, "What the hell is going on?"

1290
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,820
 And Sarah was like, "Ah, you know, they're never available.

1291
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:44,340
 People usually buy the skeletons, you know, right off the jump."

1292
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,740
 But I went online, and I saw that there were skeletons available, and I thought, "I'll

1293
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,740
 get one."

1294
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:55,580
 And I thought I clicked the 7-foot one, but I guess I clicked the 12-foot one.

1295
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,460
 And she's like, "And then, like, when we're putting it together, I'm putting it together

1296
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,420
 with the two kids, and like the instructions say specifically, you need two adults to put

1297
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,940
 this together."

1298
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,940
 So she went across the street...

1299
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,940
 That doesn't...

1300
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,940
 One adult and two kids.

1301
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,940
 That's fine.

1302
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,940
 Just put a trench coat on.

1303
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,940
 Yeah, yeah.

1304
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,940
 That's close enough.

1305
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:18,060
 Now you're two kids as one adult in a trench coat.

1306
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,700
 And I laughed, and she told me the whole story of trying to put it together and getting a

1307
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,220
 neighbor to help, and how she didn't mean to get a 12-foot skeleton, and how just they

1308
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,620
 tell you not to throw out the box, because that's how you need to put it away in the

1309
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,580
 box, is actually taking it...

1310
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,020
 It's literally sitting on top of all of my magic stuff like a hat in my garage.

1311
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,020
 It's just a giant box.

1312
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,340
 It's a hat on top of my stuff in the garage.

1313
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,620
 This is the best thing that's ever happened to you, Matt.

1314
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,620
 I laughed so hard.

1315
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,620
 This skeleton.

1316
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
 Yes.

1317
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,620
 Because I said...

1318
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,620
 This is the best thing that's ever happened to you.

1319
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,620
 Yes.

1320
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,620
 Go.

1321
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,700
 I said, "If you wrote down every detail of the story and how it progressed and how it

1322
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:56,820
 happened and the twists and turns, you would bet 100% that this is my story and Sarah's

1323
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,820
 coming home mad."

1324
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,820
 Right?

1325
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,820
 Yep.

1326
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,820
 Yep.

1327
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,680
 I was like, "Every word coming out of your mouth is my words.

1328
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,100
 This is absolutely something that I would do."

1329
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:11,300
 I am hearing you tell this story, and I'm still not entirely sure that you didn't buy

1330
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,300
 this skeleton.

1331
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,300
 No.

1332
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,300
 Right?

1333
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,300
 It just sounds like...

1334
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
 It reeks of me.

1335
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
 Yeah.

1336
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,300
 Yeah.

1337
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,300
 Every detail of it.

1338
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
 Even the skeleton...

1339
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,300
 Guess what?

1340
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,300
 It was late because it overslept.

1341
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
 No.

1342
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,300
 This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to Matt and Natalie.

1343
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,900
 So I was giddy.

1344
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,540
 I was like, "I love all of it."

1345
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,020
 I love that I can't get to my magic stuff because of the box.

1346
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,020
 I love every piece of it.

1347
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,020
 I don't care.

1348
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,020
 I love that something that Sarah bought is in the way in the garage now.

1349
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,020
 This is great.

1350
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
 Because I thought I was going to get shit...

1351
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
 Because I did go overboard.

1352
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,020
 I bought...

1353
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,060
 Do you get targeted on social media for those things that cover your garage door, like a

1354
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,060
 spooky...

1355
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,060
 Oh, yes.

1356
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,060
 Ooh.

1357
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,060
 Yeah, yeah.

1358
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,060
 I haven't gotten targeted for those.

1359
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,100
 So I bought two of those because I got one for the small garage door and one for the

1360
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,100
 big garage door.

1361
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,100
 Okay.

1362
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,820
 So it was an complimentary and whatever.

1363
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:03,060
 And then once Sarah had that 12 foot skeleton, I was like, "Hey, guess what, everybody?

1364
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,660
 Let's get the shit up on the garage door."

1365
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,660
 I was going to yell that.

1366
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:12,140
 There's not a single way I'm going to get in trouble for these garage door things now.

1367
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,140
 No way.

1368
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,140
 Let's go.

1369
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,140
 Let's go.

1370
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,140
 And so now...

1371
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,140
 How do they look?

1372
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,140
 Do they work out?

1373
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,140
 Oh.

1374
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,140
 So now this year's trick and treat is going to crush.

1375
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,140
 We have our 12 foot skeleton.

1376
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,140
 We have our zip lining skeleton.

1377
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,140
 We have...

1378
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,140
 Got your levitator.

1379
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,140
 We got...

1380
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,140
 I'm going to be levitating kids.

1381
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,140
 Yeah.

1382
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,100
 I got this magical duck where you bob the head and it picks your card out of a batch

1383
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,100
 of cards.

1384
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,100
 Holy smokes.

1385
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
 Right?

1386
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,100
 I'm going to be surprised at the people...

1387
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,020
 Surprised at the shit out of people with that clown, with that creepy clown that Ryan built

1388
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,020
 for me.

1389
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,020
 Oh, yeah.

1390
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,020
 That thing's crazy.

1391
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,020
 Oh, that's right.

1392
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,020
 Yeah, good.

1393
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,020
 Yeah.

1394
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,020
 No, we're ready.

1395
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,020
 We are ready.

1396
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,020
 Yeah.

1397
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,020
 I'm jealous.

1398
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
 Also, you know exactly how much room the things that you bought are going to take up in storage

1399
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,740
 for the rest of the year.

1400
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,580
 And you know how much room the thing that Sarah bought is going to take up in storage for

1401
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,580
 the rest of the year.

1402
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,580
 Yeah.

1403
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,460
 And Matt's life is going to be good this year.

1404
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,460
 That's really 90% of why we don't have a giant skeleton, because Ann's like, "Where are we

1405
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,460
 going to store it?"

1406
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,460
 Yeah.

1407
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,460
 And she's right.

1408
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,500
 But I do try to make the argument that we could just keep it outside like people do

1409
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,500
 and decorate it all year.

1410
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,460
 The Autobot Society will frown on that.

1411
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,220
 Well, Ann's been showing off the pictures of the new house, right?

1412
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,220
 Yeah.

1413
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:21,020
 And at the front in the planner box, I've got all my dog skeletons set up with one little

1414
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:26,660
 pumpkin, and that's been getting lots of compliments.

1415
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:32,340
 But also, to a man, people love the color of the garage door.

1416
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,340
 They love it.

1417
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,820
 They love the pop of color of the garage door.

1418
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,820
 It's a little brighter.

1419
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,940
 What is the new garage door color?

1420
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:44,300
 It's a wood type color, but it's got the slightest hint of red inside of it.

1421
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,300
 You know what I mean?

1422
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,300
 All right.

1423
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,300
 Mahogany.

1424
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,300
 Yeah.

1425
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,060
 It's a bright wood color.

1426
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,060
 It's a bright wood color.

1427
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:57,100
 It's a little lighter than what the designer had set for her when she was picking out colors.

1428
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,580
 It's the color that she asked for, because she picked the Sherman Williams color that

1429
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,180
 the designer sent for, but it just comes off a little brighter, and it really makes the

1430
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,180
 house look great.

1431
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,180
 It really does.

1432
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,180
 I think it's awesome.

1433
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,500
 She's coming around to it more and more.

1434
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,940
 At first, she was like, "Oh, no, it's too bright," but it's...

1435
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,300
 Oh, that is nice.

1436
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,300
 It's not.

1437
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,300
 It's really nice.

1438
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1439
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,580
 I just found Ann's social media here.

1440
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,580
 The house looks great.

1441
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,080
 Yeah, it looks fantastic.

1442
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,460
 It's such a cry from where it was.

1443
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,780
 As Ranch Slunk asks, "Wait, Autobot Society?"

1444
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
 And that's it.

1445
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,540
 If you get a skeleton that can just turn into a motorcycle, then you can get in the higher

1446
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,020
 rankings of the Autobot Society.

1447
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,020
 Oh, hey.

1448
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,100
 I don't know if you guys are aware.

1449
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
 Probably not.

1450
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,900
 Fantastic news on the Autobot front.

1451
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,900
 Oh.

1452
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,980
 Wait, do you want to tell them or do you want me to tell them?

1453
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
 I'll tell them.

1454
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,980
 Okay.

1455
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,980
 So you guys are...

1456
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,980
 Wait, no, this was in my note to talk about later.

1457
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,980
 Oh, fine.

1458
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,980
 We'll skip ahead.

1459
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,100
 We have one, Mr. Robert Kirkman.

1460
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,100
 Yes?

1461
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,100
 Yes.

1462
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:56,700
 So, creator of The Walking Dead and the comic and also creator of Invincible.

1463
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,700
 Okay.

1464
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,700
 Okay.

1465
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:06,620
 So, Invincible, you may well know as a very successful Prime series on the old Amazon.

1466
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:13,380
 Yeah, Kirkman has just locked down a deal that's in production now.

1467
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,500
 He's got three comic book series that are out right now.

1468
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:23,140
 New run of GI Joe, new run of Transformers, and this series called Void Rivals, which

1469
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,940
 sort of incorporates a lot of the stuff.

1470
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,700
 It's all Hasbro toy properties mushed into.

1471
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:37,020
 So they're putting out a cartoon series with those three properties, so it's going to have

1472
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,260
 Transformers and GI Joe.

1473
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,060
 So even though they couldn't really get it going in the movies yet, Kirkman is going

1474
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,980
 to do it in an animated style, and it's going to have a more adult slant.

1475
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,980
 So I'm really excited.

1476
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,980
 It's going to have like more of a-

1477
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,820
 Like they'll fuck the shit out of each other.

1478
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:53,820
 Yeah.

1479
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:58,140
 I did Costco myself again the other day.

1480
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,500
 What'd you do?

1481
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:04,540
 So I remember the story when I thought I was buying like a bag of chicken nuggets, but

1482
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,760
 then in the cart you see a big Costco, you're like, "I just bought a regular bag of chicken

1483
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,760
 nuggets."

1484
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,140
 You get home and you're like, "Oh, this is gigantic.

1485
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,340
 This is actually two and a half bags of chicken nuggets, and I cannot fit it in my freezer."

1486
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:20,700
 And so I had to buy Halloween candies, of course we were at a Costco for Halloween candy.

1487
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:26,300
 And we're doing not only trick and treat in my neighborhood, popular neighborhood, and

1488
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:33,100
 also we have a trunk and treat this year, trunk or treat at the school, kids' school.

1489
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,100
 Ah, great.

1490
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,180
 And so my mom was like, "We should sign us up for that."

1491
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,180
 I said, "Okay."

1492
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,740
 So we got to get enough Halloween candy for- It's a lot.

1493
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,740
 For us.

1494
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,940
 What was your peace campaign?

1495
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:51,740
 I was just going to buy bags, so Paul already asked a very intimidating question, right?

1496
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:58,620
 Well, I mean, we get around 300 trick or treaters, so I got around 300 pieces of candy.

1497
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:03,400
 I ended up with closer to 400 just to be safe, and I'm asking my sister-in-law to bring another

1498
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,380
 bag just in case, because some of them little motherfuckers are greedy.

1499
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,140
 Yeah, they do the bit the claw.

1500
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,140
 Yeah.

1501
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,140
 Well, let me tell you something.

1502
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:15,540
 The claw is welcome this year at the Donnelly household, I'll tell you that much right now.

1503
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,540
 Everyone can claw it.

1504
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,540
 Oh shit.

1505
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,820
 So I literally- And also if anyone would like to store a 12-foot skeleton, please inquire

1506
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,820
 with it.

1507
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,340
 So I go in, and Costco really simplified things this year.

1508
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:33,020
 There's normally, they have a bunch of varieties and you try to figure out, you can get the

1509
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:38,540
 big bars, you can get the little pieces, whatever, they just had two variety packs.

1510
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,460
 They had favorites and a thing called goodies, and the goodies were the more fruit-flavored

1511
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,580
 stuff, like Twizzlers and Skittles and that kind of stuff.

1512
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,580
 Oh, nice.

1513
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,580
 Okay.

1514
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,580
 And then the other were favorites, which is-

1515
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,580
 Chocolate?

1516
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,580
 Yeah.

1517
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,580
 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and that kind of stuff.

1518
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:56,860
 Almond Joy is in there, which is no one's favorites, and Twix, Snickers, the whole Milky

1519
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,580
 Way, the whole bit.

1520
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,340
 And so- The superior candy bars to Almond Joy.

1521
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:09,260
 I have my giant Costco cart, and so I grab six bags of the favorites and four bags of

1522
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,260
 the goodies.

1523
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,260
 Holy fuck.

1524
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,420
 So I'm figuring three and two for Halloween and three and two for the-

1525
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,420
 Okay.

1526
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,620
 For the Trunk or Treat.

1527
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,620
 Holy shit.

1528
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,460
 And then I go like, "That's not enough."

1529
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,460
 Oh no!

1530
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:28,260
 And so I grab two more bags of the favorites, two more bags of the goodies, and then I got

1531
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:35,180
 like allergen-friendly Mott's Apple Packs for people who hate themselves but still go

1532
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,180
 trick or treating.

1533
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,180
 Yeah, sure.

1534
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:41,780
 Yeah, I mean, that would be unsafe for a peanut allergy person to go trick or treating, right?

1535
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:48,060
 And I knew I made a mistake when I was going to check out and the guy goes, "Oh, I'm going

1536
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,320
 to your house for Halloween."

1537
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:55,520
 And I was like, "I don't think I should- I thought I was- I should look like I have more

1538
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,180
 than the average amount of candy that someone might purchase for Halloween."

1539
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,940
 Well, you know, if it's two events, then it looks double.

1540
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,940
 Yeah.

1541
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,940
 Technically, it's double.

1542
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,940
 Yeah.

1543
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,300
 Which would make anybody go, "Holy shit, you got double the Halloween candy."

1544
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:13,020
 And then Costco, I bring it up and they told me the price and I was like, "Geez, how much-

1545
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,020
 what?"

1546
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,740
 And then I still was like, "Ah, fuck it."

1547
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,500
 I bought- I was like, "$300 worth of Halloween candy."

1548
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
 Jesus fuck!

1549
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,500
 Yeah.

1550
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,780
 Halloween candy is incredibly expensive this year.

1551
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,780
 And I was like-

1552
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,060
 I got a deal on Target's website with a BOGO.

1553
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,060
 Yeah.

1554
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:33,540
 So, you know, besides my 15% off, it made it affordable, but still very expensive.

1555
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,980
 Because I usually get six or seven bags from the supermarket.

1556
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,980
 Yeah.

1557
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,980
 And it's crazy money at the supermarket.

1558
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,980
 Right.

1559
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,620
 And so I thought, "I'll save money," but then when I'm home with the prices, I'm like, "This

1560
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,620
 doesn't feel like it's saving money."

1561
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,860
 And then I got home and I started to unpack and I was like, "Nope, I get it now."

1562
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,860
 And they're probably bigger-

1563
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,220
 Where I stored the Halloween candy last year, I couldn't fit it all in where I stored it

1564
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,220
 last year.

1565
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,220
 Wow.

1566
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,220
 I'm stacking it up on the top shelf.

1567
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,940
 They're bigger bags, too, because they're Costco bags, right?

1568
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,100
 Each bag was five pounds.

1569
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,380
 I didn't read until I got home.

1570
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,740
 What was your price count at the end of the day?

1571
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,180
 So how many pounds of candy?

1572
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,180
 Yeah.

1573
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,980
 I bought 60 pounds of candy?

1574
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,980
 Yeah.

1575
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,980
 Okay.

1576
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,500
 That's a lot.

1577
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,500
 That's a small child.

1578
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,380
 Just to say, we do these episodes on Twitch and I'm looking at all of the reeling faces

1579
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:28,060
 and the ... Yeah, I now have a metric going forward to measure future purchases.

1580
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,060
 Good.

1581
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,060
 60.

1582
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,060
 Too much.

1583
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,980
 Well, it's 30 pounds each, 30 pounds on Halloween, 30 pounds on Trunk or Treat.

1584
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:42,620
 This Trunk or Treat, if I end up just having only 12 kids come to the trunk, I'm going

1585
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,620
 to be furious.

1586
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,620
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1587
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:52,340
 I got a text from my oldest before I went to school, he was like, "Hey, there's a cross-country

1588
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,340
 final meetup today.

1589
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,100
 Can I bring some candy to the knees?"

1590
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,100
 Please.

1591
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,100
 "Yes, son.

1592
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,100
 Help yourself."

1593
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,100
 Take it.

1594
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,100
 Take a whole bag.

1595
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,100
 "Final means, please."

1596
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,100
 Grab a bag.

1597
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,100
 In fact- Paul, how many pieces of candy did you say you had?

1598
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:12,620
 I estimated, like I said, we get about 300 people, so I estimated to get close to 400

1599
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:17,060
 on my own, and I'm hoping my sister-in-law brings another 100, so around 500 pieces.

1600
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:21,420
 So about 500 pieces, all right, and you got two people working on getting 500 pieces.

1601
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,420
 That's good.

1602
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,300
 I've just done a little bit of quick math here.

1603
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:31,660
 According to Google, one small chocolate bar weighs about 10 grams, and so Matt has gotten

1604
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:37,540
 approximately 2,721 and a half pieces of candy.

1605
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,540
 Okay.

1606
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,540
 So that's four times what I have.

1607
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,540
 Yeah, yeah.

1608
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,540
 All right.

1609
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,540
 So you may have gone a little overboard.

1610
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,540
 Here's the great thing about it.

1611
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:44,540
 I want to squeak.

1612
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:45,540
 I have a very popular neighborhood.

1613
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,540
 Same with me.

1614
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,540
 You do.

1615
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,540
 That is true.

1616
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:52,900
 You do have a very popular trick-or-treating neighborhood.

1617
01:03:52,900 --> 01:04:00,340
 But last year, what I believe probably was maybe 14 pounds of candy, now that I'm looking

1618
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,620
 back, I bet the bags I bought from the supermarket were two pounds and not five.

1619
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,620
 Yeah, yeah.

1620
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,620
 Maybe even three.

1621
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,620
 Maybe even three.

1622
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,620
 Maybe even three.

1623
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,540
 There was this thing where a guy drove up with a truck, and the kids were hanging off

1624
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:18,740
 the truck, and they're doing the later rounds of Halloween, and he ran up to our house.

1625
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,740
 We were cleaning up.

1626
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,740
 They're getting it there.

1627
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,740
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1628
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:22,740
 Oh, just take it.

1629
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,740
 Yeah.

1630
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,740
 Yeah, yeah.

1631
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
 And they were just filling their bags with it.

1632
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,740
 Yeah.

1633
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,740
 And that happened last year, too.

1634
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,740
 Yeah.

1635
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,740
 My oldest saw that.

1636
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,740
 He was upset.

1637
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,620
 And I literally, I said, "Don't worry about it."

1638
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,780
 And I walked into the garage, and I grabbed the last bag of candy, just opened it, put

1639
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,780
 it back in the bucket.

1640
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,780
 I was like, "We're fine."

1641
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,780
 Yeah.

1642
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,780
 Everything is okay.

1643
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,980
 So now, I hope that truck comes by like three or four times, I think.

1644
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,980
 No.

1645
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:46,980
 No.

1646
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:47,980
 No.

1647
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,300
 You're going to have it pre-bagged for them.

1648
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,580
 The dark reality is, Matt, you should give that all to a food bank at the end of the

1649
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,580
 day.

1650
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,580
 What if there's leftover?

1651
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,580
 Oh, that's a good idea.

1652
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,580
 That's fine.

1653
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,580
 Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,580
 I'll do that.

1655
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,580
 Do they want it?

1656
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,580
 I am so happy right now.

1657
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,580
 Here's the thing.

1658
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,580
 This is the first time that I've ever been happy that we don't have a churn, because

1659
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:09,420
 every Halloween, Matt brings all the leftover candy into the churn.

1660
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,420
 That's true.

1661
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,420
 It happens.

1662
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,420
 There's not a churn right now.

1663
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,420
 That's right.

1664
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:19,380
 And this is, honestly, I think that should be a national move is extra candy goes to

1665
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,300
 the food banks, because people don't ... That's one of those things.

1666
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,820
 People talk shit on like, "Oh, what are you doing, person who can't afford food, buying

1667
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,820
 candy?

1668
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,820
 Fuck you."

1669
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,660
 No.

1670
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,940
 Everybody likes fucking candy.

1671
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,940
 Give some candy.

1672
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,940
 Let the kids have some candy.

1673
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,500
 Let the adults have some candy.

1674
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,060
 Fuck it.

1675
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,580
 Just because it's a food bank doesn't mean it has to all be pasta and beans.

1676
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,580
 Candy.

1677
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,580
 Go for it.

1678
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,580
 Yeah, yeah.

1679
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:51,060
 How much would you love going to get some name-brand candy from a food bank if you're

1680
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,060
 hard up?

1681
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,060
 Yeah.

1682
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,060
 What would that be?

1683
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,820
 AI is also mentioning Ronald McDonald houses and things like that.

1684
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,820
 There you go.

1685
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,820
 All right.

1686
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,060
 I don't trust AI, but okay.

1687
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:06,500
 I asked AI, "What are good places to donate leftover Halloween candy to?"

1688
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:11,900
 Oh, and it said, "The collective consciousness of the computer brain."

1689
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,540
 And then the second suggestion was Ronald McDonald houses.

1690
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:24,100
 They said, "You drive the houses of copywriters, of illustrators, everybody losing their jobs

1691
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,100
 to me.

1692
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,860
 You should go bring them a bag of candy."

1693
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,860
 Exactly.

1694
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,860
 Real artists.

1695
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,860
 They can get cheered up.

1696
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:37,820
 Yeah, I'm going to need a list of like 10 places.

1697
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:45,620
 Sneaking into Home Depot's and throwing candy into the dumpsters.

1698
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,620
 Exactly.

1699
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:50,180
 That is so much candy.

1700
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:53,060
 We've still got a little bit of Halloween candy from last Halloween.

1701
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,060
 Yeah.

1702
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,060
 Yeah.

1703
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:58,700
 I think the record number of trick-or-treaters that we've had at our house in the years that

1704
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,020
 we've lived here has been three.

1705
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,080
 I think the most we've ever had in a single Halloween night has been three.

1706
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,080
 Yeah.

1707
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,580
 So we don't purchase Halloween candy.

1708
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:11,020
 We just give them whatever is around that we give to them.

1709
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,020
 That sounds good.

1710
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,020
 We just become the weird house.

1711
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,020
 Sometimes we get a couple of candy bars.

1712
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,020
 A slice of Little Caesars.

1713
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,020
 Yeah.

1714
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,020
 Sometimes.

1715
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,020
 A slice of Little Caesars.

1716
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:21,340
 Well, that's what- Here's a sandwich.

1717
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,620
 My sister-in-law, she'd been living in a very rural area for a long time.

1718
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,620
 They got no trick-or-treaters.

1719
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:31,460
 A scuba nova girl, I definitely give mini bottles of booze to any adults that come by

1720
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,460
 the house.

1721
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,860
 I absolutely do that.

1722
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,340
 That makes their night, I'm sure.

1723
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,340
 Yeah.

1724
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,340
 Well, that's a good idea.

1725
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,340
 She's coming after this.

1726
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:45,220
 What we got is we got some individually wrapped doggie sticks because some people do come

1727
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,220
 by with their puppies.

1728
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,220
 Oh, that's nice.

1729
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,220
 Yeah.

1730
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,220
 So we're going to give out- That's a good idea.

1731
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,880
 The first 12 dogs will get a delicious chicken stick from our house.

1732
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,500
 We tried to find individually wrapped stuff, but they were sold out everywhere, but we

1733
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,740
 got these little chicken sticks that were individually wrapped, and that was good.

1734
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,620
 I said, "Let's just get 12 of these."

1735
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,620
 They were like 20 cents a piece, something like that, and I was like, "You think that's

1736
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,620
 enough?"

1737
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,540
 I said, "That's six dogs an hour."

1738
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:17,580
 If we get more than six dogs an hour, something's weird with the timeline.

1739
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:24,780
 I also did buy two fresh Transant gay rights flags to tape up my sign this year.

1740
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,780
 Nice.

1741
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:26,780
 Oh, that'll be good.

1742
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,780
 That'll be good.

1743
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,780
 Yeah.

1744
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,780
 I'm trying to get those freshened back up just because-

1745
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,740
 Are you going to give away the old flags?

1746
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,100
 They get weathered pretty quickly.

1747
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:41,300
 We go through them, just the way Vegas weather is and how cheap those little tiny flags are.

1748
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,300
 Oh, yeah.

1749
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,300
 They get weathered pretty quickly, so I have to replace them pretty often, but I'm making

1750
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,420
 sure to make it nice and fresh and bright for Halloween.

1751
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,420
 Hell yeah.

1752
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:52,420
 When people are coming by, that'll be good.

1753
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,500
 I should get some chalk and do a Day of the Dead skull on my driveway.

1754
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,500
 That would be really cool.

1755
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:04,500
 I almost got roped in this year, and I held off because I get targeted for those custom

1756
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,100
 rollout, bright carpets where you can roll out a carpet that looks like it's a hole with

1757
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,380
 skeletons crawling out of it.

1758
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,380
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1759
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,380
 Oh, right.

1760
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,380
 Uh-huh.

1761
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,380
 Next year.

1762
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,340
 Like a vortex you could fall into?

1763
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,340
 Yes.

1764
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,340
 When you're walking, it looks like you might fall into a hole.

1765
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,340
 Cool.

1766
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,340
 Yeah.

1767
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,340
 That's going to be next year.

1768
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,340
 That's the whole thing.

1769
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,340
 Every year I try and add on.

1770
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:31,620
 This year, I've got my shysty mask last year that goes under my skull face, so you can't

1771
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,980
 see anything but skull face.

1772
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,980
 Yeah.

1773
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:34,980
 What is a shysty mask?

1774
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:37,100
 A shysty mask, it just grips your face.

1775
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,420
 A lot of times it's got a face print on it that's really freaky.

1776
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,060
 Look up some shysty masks.

1777
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,020
 Those creep you out, but you can't see anything.

1778
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:50,100
 It totally blacks out everything except for you just only see the outside mask.

1779
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,540
 And then I got some black gloves this year, so my hands will be under black gloves.

1780
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,140
 And then I got those extendy fingers.

1781
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,820
 Oh, a shysty mask is like a baklava or a bala, how do you say that fucking?

1782
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,820
 Balaklava.

1783
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,820
 That's it.

1784
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,820
 Not a baklava.

1785
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,820
 That's a food.

1786
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,220
 I actually freak kids out by wearing baklava on my face.

1787
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:13,380
 I just cover, I take Greek dessert and shove my face into it.

1788
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,220
 Yeah, Tim skimpets the same mask this year, but now I've got skeletal fingers as well.

1789
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,220
 Yeah.

1790
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,620
 Every year just add a little something.

1791
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,620
 Yeah, that's the plan.

1792
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:26,900
 Speaking of adding something, it's time for Jack vs. Nerd.

1793
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,900
 So it is.

1794
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,900
 We're going to add to your loss total.

1795
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:28,900
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time!

1796
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:51,980
 Time for Jack vs. Nerd!

1797
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,980
 Explosion.

1798
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:53,980
 Too much candy.

1799
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,980
 Bleh.

1800
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:55,980
 Never enough.

1801
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,980
 So much candy.

1802
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:02,700
 We've got an Obelisk Jock vs. Nerd coming to us today from M.L. Kennedy.

1803
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,320
 $200 all the way up to $5,000.

1804
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
 We've got double downs.

1805
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,320
 We've got steals.

1806
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,140
 We've got super steals where we steal each other's points.

1807
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:13,220
 And we've got 50/50 to make the answers a little bit easier for us.

1808
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,740
 The category is, "Oh Canada?"

1809
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,340
 Paul, you're up first.

1810
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,260
 Okay, let's see.

1811
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:24,940
 Which of the following SCTV actors was born in Canada?

1812
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:34,020
 Joe Flaherty, Andrea Martin, Catherine O'Hara, Harold Ramis.

1813
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:41,260
 Just a reminder, you have a 50/50 you can use, Paul.

1814
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,380
 I'm going to go see Catherine O'Hara.

1815
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,100
 Catherine O'Hara is correct!

1816
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,100
 Boom!

1817
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,100
 Stages control the board.

1818
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,860
 I thought Joe Flaherty was too.

1819
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,860
 I know.

1820
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:51,860
 I thought Joe Flaherty was also.

1821
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:56,580
 That was the only other one I thought was a little iffy, but I somehow remembered it

1822
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,580
 was Catherine O'Hara.

1823
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,580
 So there you go.

1824
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,580
 Paul, you're up!

1825
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,580
 What's the question?

1826
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:07,260
 Oh, wait, I'm forgetting what game we're playing.

1827
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,940
 Oh, that guy.

1828
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,740
 Here's Paul's question.

1829
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,100
 Help!

1830
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:17,140
 Actor Kevin McKidd from Trainspotting and Dog Soldiers can't escape from Grey's Anatomy.

1831
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:20,300
 How many episodes is he currently credited with on IMDB?

1832
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:23,060
 Oh, for fart love hell.

1833
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,420
 181, 254, 336, or 368.

1834
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,900
 Oh, boy.

1835
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,820
 Paul, you were just talking about this.

1836
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,820
 Yeah.

1837
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:35,820
 He loves counting episodes.

1838
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:36,820
 This is right up his alley.

1839
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,140
 I feel like it's between A and B.

1840
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,140
 Okay.

1841
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:42,140
 That's 181 or 254.

1842
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,820
 Is Grey's Anatomy still happening?

1843
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,300
 It probably is.

1844
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,300
 Shit.

1845
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,020
 Matt, is Grey's Anatomy still happening?

1846
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,780
 Oh, yes.

1847
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,780
 Is it?

1848
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,780
 Yeah.

1849
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,780
 Okay, B.

1850
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,820
 254 is incorrect.

1851
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,820
 It's 368.

1852
01:12:58,820 --> 01:12:59,820
 Oh, wow.

1853
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,820
 That's a lot of residuals.

1854
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:03,820
 368.

1855
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,820
 That really is.

1856
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:05,820
 That's money.

1857
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,820
 Matt, that goes to you.

1858
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:09,620
 The $600 question, Mr. Ed.

1859
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,620
 Anybody want to steal?

1860
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,180
 Anybody want to do anything?

1861
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,180
 No?

1862
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,680
 Here we go.

1863
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,380
 That Talking Horse Show had numerous episodes wherein celebrities met Mr. Ed.

1864
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:23,220
 Which of the following is not a real episode of the series?

1865
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,220
 Okay.

1866
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,300
 Clint Eastwood meets Mr. Ed.

1867
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,220
 Mae West meets Mr. Ed.

1868
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,580
 George Burns meets Mr. Ed.

1869
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,060
 Or Charles Bronson meets Mr. Ed.

1870
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,820
 My instinct first was like George Burns because I feel like he's better than that.

1871
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,260
 But George Burns, you just stick in to make anything funny.

1872
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,260
 Yeah.

1873
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,260
 Yeah.

1874
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,260
 I feel like he got into it.

1875
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:46,620
 And it's also a comedy and I feel like George Burns probably knew half the writing staff.

1876
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,620
 Yeah.

1877
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,220
 I think Mae West might have been dead.

1878
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,860
 When Mr. Ed was made?

1879
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,260
 She might have been trampled to death by Mr. Ed.

1880
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,260
 Yeah.

1881
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,260
 That's it.

1882
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,260
 Trampled to death.

1883
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,260
 I'm going to...

1884
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:04,780
 I don't think Charles Bronson was a big enough star.

1885
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,780
 Oh.

1886
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,580
 Oh, I'm here to kill this horse.

1887
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,780
 He was a Western star from the Cheetahs.

1888
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,780
 Oh, you're right.

1889
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,780
 You're right.

1890
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,780
 You're right.

1891
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,780
 You're right.

1892
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,780
 That very much fits in with the horse show.

1893
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,780
 That was my logic.

1894
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,780
 All right.

1895
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,780
 All right.

1896
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,780
 But I don't know.

1897
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
 It's your question to fuck up.

1898
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,780
 Don't blame me.

1899
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,780
 Don't blame me.

1900
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:27,780
 If I get this right, I will kill myself in the shower and pin it on Paul.

1901
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:28,780
 Mother fucker.

1902
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,220
 I knew it was coming.

1903
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,900
 Can't go one day without thinking Matt died.

1904
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:34,900
 All right.

1905
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,900
 I'll go Clint Eastwood.

1906
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:36,900
 Hey.

1907
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,900
 It's Charles Bronson.

1908
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,900
 Oh, you were so right.

1909
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,900
 Fuck you.

1910
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,900
 You did me dirty, man.

1911
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,900
 I did you dirty.

1912
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:42,900
 Perfect.

1913
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,900
 Yeah.

1914
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:51,900
 I wouldn't have got it right because I would have thought it was Charles Bronson.

1915
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,860
 It comes to me.

1916
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,860
 Wayne's world.

1917
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,220
 Anybody stealing or anything?

1918
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,220
 Yeah, I'm stealing.

1919
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,220
 Oh shit.

1920
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,460
 I fucking love Wayne's world.

1921
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,460
 All right.

1922
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,460
 Matt stealing.

1923
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,460
 What is the name of Wayne's gun rack buying ex-girlfriend in Wayne's world?

1924
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,420
 Stacey, Becky, Shelby, or Cassandra?

1925
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:18,340
 Stacey, Becky, Shelby, or Cassandra?

1926
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,180
 I think it's Stacey.

1927
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,180
 Hey.

1928
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,740
 It's Stacey.

1929
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:26,540
 Her mom's got it going on and she was in Wayne's world.

1930
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,540
 Nice one.

1931
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:32,700
 Matt, you got movie stars, thousand dollar question movie stars.

1932
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,340
 Paul, yell out if you want to steal.

1933
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,340
 I will steal.

1934
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,340
 God damn it.

1935
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,220
 Paul's stealing.

1936
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:45,540
 Which of the following actors was not in a 1989 slasher comedy, cutting, what does that

1937
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,540
 say?

1938
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,540
 Cutting class.

1939
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,540
 Cutting class.

1940
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,540
 So, which of the following actors was not in a cutting class?

1941
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:56,820
 Brad Pitt, Roddy McDowell, Martin Mull, Christopher Walken.

1942
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:01,100
 This is, who wrote this?

1943
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,100
 They did a good job.

1944
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,100
 This is a very...

1945
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,100
 This is ML Kennedy, I believe.

1946
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,100
 Yeah.

1947
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:12,780
 Paul, this is your question.

1948
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:17,940
 I'll go Walken.

1949
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,060
 Christopher Walken is correct.

1950
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,060
 Yes.

1951
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,700
 Give it to me.

1952
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,700
 Wow.

1953
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,700
 Give me points.

1954
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,780
 $1,200 question, Star Trek.

1955
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,740
 Oh baby, I'm in my power pass.

1956
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,780
 I of course will be stealing.

1957
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:39,220
 He's doing it, he's doing it.

1958
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:45,180
 Not counting the maid for streaming section 31, which Star Trek movie has the lowest rating

1959
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,100
 on Rotten Tomatoes?

1960
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:52,300
 Star Trek, The Motion Picture, Star Trek V, The Final Frontier, Star Trek Generations,

1961
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,180
 or Star Trek Nemesis.

1962
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,900
 Those are all front runners for a shit ass movie.

1963
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:02,700
 I know that Star Trek, The Motion Picture, that's the really weird one, right?

1964
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,660
 That's the one that doesn't seem like any of the rest of Star Trek?

1965
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:11,200
 No, it's too Star Trek, and it is coming into its own now.

1966
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:16,060
 So that's the only one that I wouldn't put on the list.

1967
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,980
 I would leave A out.

1968
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,860
 The other three are fair game.

1969
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:29,100
 I don't remember Star Trek V really at all, or Star Trek Generations.

1970
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,740
 I also don't really remember Star Trek Generations, I think that was the crossover one, right?

1971
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,860
 I think that's the one where both, where the old-

1972
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:38,140
 Yes, Generations is the handover, it's where Kirk dies.

1973
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,700
 I think it was Nemesis.

1974
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,340
 I don't think anybody liked Nemesis.

1975
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,540
 Certainly didn't help the experience.

1976
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,540
 Yeah.

1977
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:50,700
 I'm gonna go Nemesis, D. Now it's Star Trek V, The Final Frontier.

1978
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:57,020
 What does God need with the starship?

1979
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,420
 Paul controls back to you, Bloodhound Gang, it's the $1,400 question.

1980
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,420
 Yeah.

1981
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,420
 Let's go.

1982
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,100
 Matt, I know you love Bloodhound Gang, did you want to super steal this one?

1983
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,580
 I don't even know what that's referring to.

1984
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:13,100
 It could either be, it's probably the music group, but me, it refers to the 321 Contact

1985
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,060
 short within the show of-

1986
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
 Oh, shit!

1987
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:21,220
 "Whenever there's trouble, they're on the double, they're the Bloodhound Gang."

1988
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:25,980
 I can't believe that you just brought that up, and I can't believe that I actually remember

1989
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:26,980
 it.

1990
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:27,980
 What is that?

1991
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,980
 It's a 321-

1992
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:33,100
 It was a short on 321 Contact, and it was this very ethnically diverse group of young

1993
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,940
 kids who solved mysteries.

1994
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,100
 Uh, yeah, I'm not stealing this one.

1995
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:42,100
 But it's gonna be about the song.

1996
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:49,700
 According to the song, "My dad says that's for pussies, what would John Wayne never do?"

1997
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:55,100
 According to the song, "My dad says that's for pussies, what would John Wayne never do?"

1998
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:03,300
 Wear a condom, vote for Obama, use a surge protector, buy an extended warranty.

1999
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,300
 I'm torn between A and D.

2000
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,300
 Yeah.

2001
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,300
 I'm gonna go with D.

2002
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:10,140
 Oh, and see, I think C is great.

2003
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,140
 C is pretty good, too.

2004
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,140
 I'm gonna go with D.

2005
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,140
 I ain't using a surge protector.

2006
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,140
 That's for pussies.

2007
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,140
 I'm gonna go with D for extended warranty.

2008
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,740
 John Wayne wouldn't use a surge protector.

2009
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,740
 You're going D?

2010
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,740
 I'm going D. He's nuts.

2011
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,740
 Ah, there you go.

2012
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:20,740
 It's C, motherfucker.

2013
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:21,740
 You have the right vibe.

2014
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:22,740
 Surge protector.

2015
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:23,740
 Yep.

2016
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,740
 Shit.

2017
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,220
 You should have stolen that one, Matt.

2018
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,060
 Oh, this one goes to Matt.

2019
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,620
 What's that name again?

2020
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,620
 Double Downs?

2021
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,620
 Super Steals?

2022
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,620
 Anybody?

2023
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,620
 No.

2024
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,620
 Nope.

2025
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:43,900
 What is the name of Wetleg's Grammy-winning song from 2021?

2026
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,900
 I just told Matt.

2027
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,900
 I just told Matt this.

2028
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:50,860
 Paul just told me this in the car, like, an hour ago.

2029
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:56,780
 Shays' Lounge, S-H-A-Y, apostrophe S. Shays' Lounge, C-H-E-Z.

2030
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:05,460
 Shays' Lounge, C-H-A-I-S-E, or Shays' Lounge, C-H-I-A-S-E.

2031
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:09,540
 This is interesting because Paul said Shays' Lounge, but he did not spell it for me this

2032
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,540
 morning.

2033
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,540
 So this is still a hard question.

2034
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,060
 Paul, do you know the spelling?

2035
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,060
 Brand new one.

2036
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:22,740
 If, were I a Benton man, I'm going to 50-50.

2037
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,740
 It's D.

2038
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,740
 It's D.

2039
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:25,740
 The really funny thing is C and D.

2040
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,740
 It's D.

2041
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,220
 But C and D are exactly the same, aren't they?

2042
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,220
 No.

2043
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,220
 Oh, no.

2044
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:31,220
 They have lounge spelled differently.

2045
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,220
 All right.

2046
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,220
 Let's do a 50-50.

2047
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,220
 That got rid of B and C.

2048
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,500
 Oh, now you know it's D.

2049
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,100
 I told you it was D.

2050
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,100
 It's D.

2051
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,100
 Yes.

2052
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,180
 Paul just put the new album in the car.

2053
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,180
 They're great.

2054
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,180
 Oh, nice.

2055
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:47,180
 Yeah.

2056
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,460
 The new Wetleg is top-notch, top tier.

2057
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:50,940
 I'll check it out today.

2058
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,940
 Okay.

2059
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,940
 $2,500 question.

2060
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:53,940
 Smoothies.

2061
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:54,940
 Smoothies.

2062
01:20:54,940 --> 01:21:00,580
 You know, I got to be honest with you, I would have stolen any of these if I had known any

2063
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:04,260
 of them.

2064
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,620
 I am not holding onto my steal for strategic reasons.

2065
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:10,460
 I'm holding onto it because I don't think I know any of the answers.

2066
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,460
 Right.

2067
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,460
 Anybody want to steal?

2068
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,460
 Anybody want to double down?

2069
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,460
 What is this category?

2070
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,460
 Smoothies.

2071
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,460
 Smoothies.

2072
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,460
 Let's double down.

2073
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,460
 Let's go nuts.

2074
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,460
 Matt wants to double down.

2075
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,460
 Whoa.

2076
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,460
 He knows his smoothies.

2077
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:27,000
 In 1998, Eve Six had their big hit with the Heart in a Blender song.

2078
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,860
 What is the actual name of that song?

2079
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:34,860
 Is it Beautiful Oblivion, Rendezvous, Inside Out, or Faith in Nothing?

2080
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,940
 Oh, Jesus.

2081
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,860
 I used my 50/50 already.

2082
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,860
 You did.

2083
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:44,980
 I would help you if I had any idea.

2084
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:50,820
 I definitely thought that song was called Heart in a Blender.

2085
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,460
 Beautiful Oblivion seems like a good song title.

2086
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,460
 Yeah.

2087
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,460
 Rendezvous.

2088
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,580
 I feel like there's already songs named Rendezvous.

2089
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,580
 Okay.

2090
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,340
 But that's the one they ... I think that's it.

2091
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,100
 Oh, you think it is Rendezvous?

2092
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,100
 I'm pretty sure.

2093
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,100
 Inside Out.

2094
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:11,340
 It's either Rendezvous or Faith in Nothing, but I'm pretty sure it's Rendezvous.

2095
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,740
 Faith in Nothing.

2096
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,820
 Yeah.

2097
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:19,820
 I believe in you, Matt.

2098
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:20,820
 Because remember the breakdown?

2099
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,820
 They go, "Rendezvous."

2100
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,820
 Yeah.

2101
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,620
 Well, all of these are lyrics in the song.

2102
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:28,500
 Yeah, but there's a breakdown where they're saying Rendezvous over and over again.

2103
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,500
 All right.

2104
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,700
 Oh, do you remember the part in the song where they say Faith in Nothing?

2105
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,840
 And the very end of the song is Rendezvous, then I'm through with you.

2106
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,880
 That's the very last line.

2107
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
 Okay.

2108
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,580
 Last time, Paul Charles Bronson.

2109
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,580
 Charles Bronson.

2110
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,580
 I don't know.

2111
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,580
 Final answer, Charles Bronson.

2112
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,580
 Charles Bronson.

2113
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,580
 B.

2114
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,580
 B, B.

2115
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,580
 It's C, Inside Out.

2116
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,580
 Oh, well, fucking shit.

2117
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,580
 Fuck both of us.

2118
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:51,580
 Yeah, I was going to be wrong no matter what, though.

2119
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,580
 That's fine.

2120
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,580
 But I did double down, so I lose all my points.

2121
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,580
 Let's see.

2122
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:58,860
 You sure did.

2123
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,860
 Oh, shit.

2124
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,860
 Goddamn it.

2125
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,860
 That's precisely what happened.

2126
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:04,860
 Oh, my God.

2127
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,860
 It comes to me.

2128
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,860
 Hometowns.

2129
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,860
 I'm not doubling.

2130
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:08,860
 I'm super stealing.

2131
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:09,860
 Whoa.

2132
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:10,860
 Super stealing.

2133
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:11,860
 I have zero points.

2134
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,860
 Matt is super stealing.

2135
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,860
 I'm taking all of Jacob's points.

2136
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:18,000
 It's the only option I have.

2137
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,940
 Chris Chavis, better known to WWF fans as...

2138
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,940
 Tatanka.

2139
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,740
 Tatanka was born in which city?

2140
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:26,740
 Oh, wow.

2141
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:32,620
 Buffalo, New York, Pembroke, North Carolina, Winnipeg, Manitoba, or Muskogee, Oklahoma.

2142
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,820
 Well, this whole thing was Canada themed, right?

2143
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:38,060
 Well, he was Native American.

2144
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,060
 Mm-hmm.

2145
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:40,060
 Pretendee.

2146
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,060
 He wasn't real.

2147
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,820
 Oh, that was his wrestling bit.

2148
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,820
 Yeah.

2149
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,820
 Oh, I remember this guy.

2150
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,820
 Yeah.

2151
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,820
 Yeah.

2152
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:47,820
 He would like...

2153
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,820
 He'd get up there and go, "Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye."

2154
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,820
 Yeah.

2155
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,460
 This sounds super weird now, but he would get up and do rain dances and shit, right?

2156
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,460
 Yes.

2157
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,460
 He would.

2158
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:55,460
 Pretend to.

2159
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,460
 Yes.

2160
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:04,740
 It was the epitome of cultural appropriation because he wasn't actually a Native American.

2161
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,980
 He also wasn't actually a wrestler.

2162
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:09,700
 Not much of one, but he was around forever in a day.

2163
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,380
 He had a long career.

2164
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,380
 Yeah.

2165
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,940
 That's what most people remember about Tatanka, his long career.

2166
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:18,180
 Well, he was a mid-level jobber, which is, you need that.

2167
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,180
 Yeah.

2168
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:22,780
 So he went to Tatanka, and then he went eel for a while, everybody was like, "What?"

2169
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,780
 Yeah.

2170
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:27,100
 I don't know if you guys know, but Paul's working on the Netflix documentary at Tatanka,

2171
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,700
 so you guys can get a nice breakdown of all these details.

2172
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,700
 He's in the middle of writing it.

2173
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:37,820
 I was sure I was going to be talking about toy trucks, but then it's a surprise.

2174
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:42,940
 I thought I was just dedicating myself to that one scene from Kevin Costner's Native American

2175
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:43,940
 film.

2176
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:44,940
 "Dances with Wolves."

2177
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,940
 "Dances with Wolves."

2178
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,060
 Poor Graham Greene just passed away.

2179
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,060
 He did.

2180
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,060
 Yeah.

2181
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,060
 Aw, he's...

2182
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,060
 Yeah.

2183
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,060
 Now, there's someone who had a long career.

2184
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,060
 "Stands with a Fist."

2185
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,620
 That's what his name means?

2186
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,180
 That was what Tatanka did in the locker room.

2187
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,180
 Oh, okay.

2188
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,180
 Oh.

2189
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:06,380
 Well, I think you've stalled for me enough times, even though I tried to guess right

2190
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,380
 away.

2191
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,380
 I'm going to go with Winnipeg, Manitoba.

2192
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,380
 Winnipeg, Manitoba?

2193
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,380
 Winnipeg, Manitoba.

2194
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,380
 Is incorrect.

2195
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,940
 It's Pembroke, North Carolina.

2196
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:14,940
 Pembroke.

2197
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,900
 I played all of my options, and I have nothing to show for it.

2198
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,900
 There you go.

2199
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,900
 There you go.

2200
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:19,900
 It's correct.

2201
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:20,900
 It's me, Ravishing.

2202
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:21,900
 Rick Rude.

2203
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:22,900
 Paul?

2204
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,900
 I mean, it's got to be...

2205
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,900
 Ravishing.

2206
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:26,900
 Rick Rude.

2207
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,900
 I guess...

2208
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,900
 I'm asking you if you're stealing.

2209
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,100
 No, I'm going to wait until the next one.

2210
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,100
 All right.

2211
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,580
 Then I'm going to double down.

2212
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:36,900
 All right.

2213
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,940
 What sort of movie was Rick Rude's finishing maneuver...

2214
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:45,860
 Oh, what sort of move was Rick Rude's finishing maneuver, "The Rude Awakening"?

2215
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:55,180
 A Canadian backbreaker rack, a shoulder neck breaker, a DDT, a sleeper hold.

2216
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,180
 Okay.

2217
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:07,100
 So Rick Rude, he was in "The Rasslin'" at the same time as the Million Dollar Man, right?

2218
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,740
 Wasn't he around then?

2219
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,900
 He had a sleeper hold.

2220
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:14,100
 He would fight with Paul Orndorff all the time.

2221
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,420
 Rick Rude was a long-time member of the Heaton family.

2222
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,940
 There he is, and I was grabbing his shoulder.

2223
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,860
 So DBSI had the sleeper hold, so I don't think he had a sleeper hold.

2224
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,860
 Well...

2225
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:24,860
 Jake the Snake had a DDT.

2226
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:28,700
 It wouldn't make sense for "An Awakening" to be a sleeper hold.

2227
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,700
 That's true too.

2228
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,620
 I have distinct memories of him and Paul Orndorff doing a flex-off contest for the audience

2229
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,860
 and it being the most homoerotic thing I've ever experienced as a child.

2230
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:37,860
 Welcome to "Rasslin'."

2231
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:38,860
 And I was an altar boy.

2232
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,860
 Yeah.

2233
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,860
 Welcome to "Rasslin'."

2234
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,820
 There's a reason why it will never go away.

2235
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:45,820
 Well, there's multiple reasons why it will never go away.

2236
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:50,020
 Now because it's fucking endorsed by the United States government.

2237
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,380
 Whose question is this?

2238
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,380
 This is me.

2239
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,380
 Jacob's.

2240
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,380
 All right.

2241
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,820
 So sleeper hold and DDT, I feel like are out.

2242
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:58,820
 Yeah.

2243
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:04,340
 I feel like that's Jake the Snake and the Million Dollar Man.

2244
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:09,300
 I do believe it was a DDT variation.

2245
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,300
 But I could be wrong.

2246
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,300
 I don't know.

2247
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:16,940
 I'll say B, a shoulder neck breaker, because I've never heard of a Canadian back breaker

2248
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,940
 rack.

2249
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:18,940
 Okay.

2250
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:19,940
 Boom.

2251
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:20,940
 Shoulder neck breaker.

2252
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,940
 Oh my goodness.

2253
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,940
 Nicely done.

2254
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,860
 I ran right through Paul trying to fuck me up.

2255
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:28,420
 You see Paul trying to fuck me up?

2256
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,420
 Me?

2257
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,420
 I'm super stealing.

2258
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,420
 I'm already doubling down.

2259
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,420
 I'm too late.

2260
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,420
 WrestleMania $5,000 question.

2261
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,420
 Paul is super stealing.

2262
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,420
 Oh, wait.

2263
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,420
 No.

2264
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:43,060
 I think taking it by the rules, Jacob later writing can he supersedes, but Jacob doesn't

2265
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:44,060
 do it.

2266
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,060
 It's too late now.

2267
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,420
 Oh, I think double down does count, but I like the idea of just jumping in and yelling

2268
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,420
 those.

2269
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,420
 Okay, great.

2270
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,380
 Braun Strowman won the tag titles at WrestleMania 34.

2271
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,860
 Why was this noteworthy?

2272
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,700
 A, he didn't show up at the event.

2273
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,100
 B, his tag partner was his ex-wife.

2274
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,220
 C, he didn't have a tag partner.

2275
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,740
 D, his tag partner was a 10 year old boy.

2276
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:05,740
 D.

2277
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:08,820
 Oh, Paul just knows it.

2278
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:12,100
 His tag partner was a 10 year old boy.

2279
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:17,420
 Let the record show that Paul Mattingly knows his 10 year old boys.

2280
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,580
 That is correct.

2281
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:24,740
 There's a reason I bought four bags of candy.

2282
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,660
 And that is the game.

2283
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,260
 Matt and I both have zero points each.

2284
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,980
 Paul has 10,200 points.

2285
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,060
 Jacob, did you draw that scary face?

2286
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,060
 No.

2287
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,060
 I don't know who drew it.

2288
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,060
 That's a zoom thing.

2289
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,060
 I don't know how people do it.

2290
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,220
 I haven't figured it out yet.

2291
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,220
 I love it.

2292
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:44,380
 We just don't know what the fuck's happening.

2293
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,380
 No, no.

2294
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,380
 Things happen.

2295
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,380
 I don't know what they are.

2296
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,380
 It was Mike Nelson.

2297
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:49,860
 Thank you, Mike Nelson.

2298
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:50,860
 Thank you.

2299
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:52,860
 Paul, well done on your victory today.

2300
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:53,860
 Oh, thank you.

2301
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:54,860
 Thank you.

2302
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,620
 You probably would have got that last one.

2303
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:58,900
 I definitely would not have.

2304
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,900
 Okay, great.

2305
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,900
 Thank you, ML Kennedy.

2306
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,900
 No, that's not what...

2307
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,380
 Thank you, ML Kennedy, for writing a fine obelisk.

2308
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,500
 It was a great one.

2309
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,500
 Yes.

2310
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,500
 I have some people to thank here.

2311
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,500
 Yeah, you do.

2312
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,500
 Yeah.

2313
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,540

 I just want to thank the following people.

01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:23,180
 All would have knocked on my door and then gone to the lobby to get a wellness check.

01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:46,820
 over to fartsinabag.biz.

01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:56,220
 That's right.

2357
01:32:56,220 --> 01:33:01,540
 If you think this show is worth more than $0, head over to PreachingFun.com, fartsinabag.biz.

2361
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,660
 We're going to do our first one this week.

2362
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,340
 I'm figuring out how to make Paul the host of it.

2363
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:21,340
 We're going to do it.

2364
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,340
 It's going to be amazing.

2365
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,180
 And yeah, Paul, when are we doing that?

2366
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,380
 It's on Monday at what time?

2367
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:29,500
 Monday at 1030, my time, Eastern time, I believe that is.

2368
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,500
 Eastern time.

2369
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,320
 Monday at 1030 to 1130.

2370
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,540
 And we're going to hang and just talk and have a good old time and we can do this kind

2371
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,340
 of doodly stuff like that.

2372
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:38,340
 And that's going to be great.

2373
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,340
 Just chop it up.

2374
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,340
 It's going to be really cool.

2375
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:44,260

2377
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:53,220
 It turns out that there is a sale going on right now at our shop.

 So if you have been wanting to put together a jock versus nerd for us, now is a great

2389
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:28,380
 time to do it.

 Make us a Price is Right jock versus nerd.

2394
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,540
 Make us an obelisk jock versus nerd like the one we just played.

01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:40,740
 Yeah, you can do all those things right over there at HayScoops.com.

 Also send us some scoop mail.

 Oh, the people are crying out for the store jingle, Jacob.

2398
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:46,740
 Oh, let them cry.

2399
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:49,740
 Let them cry.

2400
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:57,980
 Store jingle, a big store song, we got a store.

2401
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,380
 By the way, what Jacob said and that song are both Hootie and the Blowfish references.

2402
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,780
 So there you go.

2403
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:07,460
 So it is storejingle.com also will take you, boom, right to the sale page.

2404
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,460
 Oh yeah.

2405
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,460
 Oh yeah.

2406
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,460
 Oh yeah.

2407
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,460
 Oh yeah.

2408
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:12,460
 100%.

2409
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,460
 Yeah.

2410
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,460
 Yeah, sure.

2411
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:15,460
 Absolutely.

2412
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,460
 All right.

2413
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,460
 Thanks folks, everybody.

2414
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,460
 Stay safe out there.

2415
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:19,460
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

2416
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,460
 Bang on the window.

2417
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,460
 What the fuck?

2418
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:22,460
 That's somebody doing a wellness check on the mat.

2419
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,460
 Are you a liar?

2420
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:53,100
 We should just exchange hotel keys just in case.

2421
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,260
 That's the grossest idea I've ever heard.

2422
01:35:57,260 --> 01:36:02,380
 I can think of nothing worse than having Matt come in unannounced, "You okay, buddy?

2423
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,380
 Everything all right?

2424
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,380
 Everything okay, Matt?"

2425
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:12,620
 Oh, if you're not on Zoom, you're not on Twitch, you didn't see the disgust, the actual real

2426
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:16,300
 disgust that came over Paul Mattingly's face when Matt said that.

2427
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,940
 It's not, it's, yeah.

2428
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:18,940
 Oh no.

2429
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,860
 Are we oversleeping in here?

2430
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:21,980
 Oh shit.

2431
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:26,420
 I am definitely checking Paul into all hotels from now on, and I'm getting Matt and I spare

2432
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,420
 keys.

2433
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,420
 That could end the podcast.

2434
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,460
 That could end the podcast.

2435
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,460
 Not my death.

2436
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:32,460
 But this.

2437
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,460
 Yeah.

2438
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,460
 No, but a breach of trust.

2439
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:34,460
 See you everybody!
