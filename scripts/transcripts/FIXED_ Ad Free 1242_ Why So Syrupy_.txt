 I'm in the west side of Pittsburgh, which is French for Aaron Rodgers can suck my balls
 This comes out we'll know I'm telling you
 The oh, yeah, yeah, so they'll be out the truth will be out are you expecting a Rogers Renaissance Matt Donnelly
 Here's the thing one. He's old and the only person to be able to play old is Tom Brady and no one else has been
 Able to play old, right?
 but
 You know Saquon Barkley came back from an Achilles injury last year for the Giants struggled
 Then got traded the Eagles and became an MVP candidate offensive player the year in Super Bowl champion
 Most people are better their second year back from an Achilles injury
 So if Rogers is going to be healthy last year's not a sign of way he was going to play. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, do you think he's got proof?
 No, I just think out of sheer karma like that
 We live in the most annoying timeline and the most annoying timeline thing to happen with
 Aaron Rodgers Renaissance would absolutely be oh my god, Jacob. I forgot to talk to my mic for the whole first
 Okay. Now. I have my mic up to my thing
 Fantastic I will I will patch something together between the recording the zoom -
 There goes sweeten it up Donnelly there goes all the trends we were gonna hit on social media
 No, the most annoying thing that I agree with you completely Aaron Rodgers having it being the comeback player of the year this year
 Just just goes along in line perfectly. Yeah. Yeah, I wish him no ill will but I hope he snaps like a twig on the first play
 I mean
 His other Achilles does have the opportunity to do something really funny right now. It's true. Come on Achilles
 Do it
 Though I I wouldn't got I went to get into the truck last night to go to work
 SJ had left for the for the week. He's out of town until Sunday night and
 So I wouldn't got in the truck last night to go to work
 Got in hit the little it has a push button start hit the push button start and nothing happened
 Nothing happened at all. Yeah, like uh, the uh, like the lights didn't come on. No clicking nothing
 Just just dead ded dead. No, this is your gas
 Vehicle. This is the gas truck. Yeah, is it all gas?
 It is all gas. No, it's metal. I
 Mean some break some metal some oil
 Gas no breaks. No
 So I got in and it was dead
 So I had to uber to work and then uber home from work last night and then had to get up early today
 Because that's J's out of town. She has the other she has the car. Yeah, so I can't I can't jump the truck
 I don't have another car to jump the truck off of
 And so I I call roadside service. I call Dodge roadside service
 They very sweetly came out this morning. However, very early
 After getting out of a show at midnight boy, does that early morning come early? That is tough. Yes. Yeah
 and so
 He gets here. He puts the jump back on there. I say I don't know what happened. The trucks pretty new
 It shouldn't be having any battery issues, but uh, who knows let's see so he puts the jump back on
 Instantly everything comes on everything everything turns right on truck powers right up. Yeah, the battery was dead
 But I can't tell if it's charging or not
 Looks like it is though. And but he had another call to run to
 So and you said can you before you go put those on my nipples and give one more one more go
 Yeah, one more one more just hit the button clear
 Don't look at me. Okay, look at me
 Clean up my pants. I'm a triple-a member. I said clean up my pants. I need roadside assistance
 Come on I'm quadruple a I have
 Fourth a stands for the you know what the final a is in the backseat brother. Yes, sir
 Go ahead and find that. Oh, you had to come out and say it. I was trying to be all
 No, not me anal a states for anal. What are the other a stand for? I thought it was all supposed to be anal
 Yeah, yeah, it's anal anal anal anal anal if you have four a's
 That was five a's what company are you working with? Oh, dude, I've exposed the fifth a they're gonna kick me out
 only the secret fifth a
 Jacob you have to edit this out and they'll kick me out. I just quick not don't talk into your microphone again
 It's actually they wrote the theme song to the second level of Super Mario Brothers for goes anal anal anal
 Anal anal anal. Oh my gosh
 That's only the triple-a. Yeah secret lyrics. Well, Jacob
 I I don't want to step on your story here. Those pipes goes right to the trip the 5a meeting
 I don't want to step on your story here, but I have a sneaking feeling that
 Since the technician had to go away quickly and wasn't sure that the battery was charging
 I have a sneaking feeling all did not go to plan now. I know after that
 Everything is fine. Everything is currently peachy keen really battery charged up
 I took it down to Autozone and
 And they they put the the tester on it and checked it checked it over real good
 And they said it was all all good get in the thing though Autozone anal
 When Autozone used to be called Auto Shack and Radio Shack sued them. Yeah
 No, who made them change the name to Autozone who's laughing now? Who's laughing now radio?
 They were called Auto Shack, huh? Yeah when you were a kid, it was Auto Shack when we were kids. It was Auto Shack. I
 Guess I have any other shacks in Kentucky getting a shack Auto Shack Auto Shack. Don't tell your parents
 The weird thing though was when he put the the the jump pack on the truck
 Everything turned on I like I watched nobody in the zoom laughed, but Paul on that one
 Which is fine by me, but I thought I got Paul is good
 Why just taking a drink too, yeah, it was dangerous
 No, the weird thing was everything though was turned off
 So like the radio was turned all the way down and turned off
 The all of the climate control systems all the air conditioners and everything was all turned off and the doors were unlocked
 But everything was like folded up and like the mirrors were folded up and everything like like it does when it when it locks
 So what we figured out was the new Dodge and I bet other new cars have this too
 Has like a power save mode. So if it is getting down to almost dead
 It'll start turning off auxiliary systems to try to save the battery
 So it turns off there. It turns down the radio turns off the radio turns off the climate systems
 Unlocks the doors just just so you don't get locked in or locked out or whatever
 It's like a Starfleet Starship that diverse like a Starfleet Starship. Oh shoot Paul beat me to it
 It's like it's all power. I knew you were gonna say it though. It diverts all remaining power to life support
 That's it. Yeah, just bare life support
 and so what we figured out was right before she left town SJ had unloaded a whole bunch of stuff from the truck, uh-oh and
 She had when she went to turn off the truck
 We think she might have double-clicked the button or something and just turned all the auxiliary stuff back on after turning the motor off
 And just left it running. Wait, is it a keyless car? Yes. Got it makes sense
 And so I think she turned the auxiliary stuff on left everything running. It looks like it ran for about nine hours
 Yeah, wow, but the battery held out for a really long time. It's pretty good
 Can that be good for your battery to run dry like that? If you just woke up early Jacob, you'd be fine
 You know if you just woke up a little earlier
 Well motherfucker I did today
 Usually I'm up for like 45 minutes before we start recording I've been up for three and a half hours today
 Buddy, I feel you in San Antonio every day and I just walk like a different direction
 See if I can discover they're basically just is basically I'm going to discover a place for coffee in a place for breakfast tacos
 I just have to go whichever direction. I pleased to find a new place
 right, and I saw the sign for coffee and I went inside there's actually this lush lobby of a hotel on this beautiful coffee station that
 was there and
 Then on the menu is clearly like put together by like a true coffee
 enthusiast all kinds of different drinks and syrups and that I don't normally see dirty sodas
 Basically a lot for dirty sodas and the really nice espresso
 Cappuccino machine, you know those real real deal machines. Yeah a lot of Starbucks push-button one and
 Ask the lady if I could have you know an Americano and a point of one of the syrups and she goes I
 Yeah, yeah, you want like a big cup. I was like, yep. That size is good. And then I was like pastries here
 What are these what are these things in the middle?
 see, I I
 Think they're danishes
 Okay, was this like her first hour on shift? I go I
 What I didn't want to say but I go I also think they're danishes. I just don't know what
 You and I both recognize the circular shape but I was curious to the contain with the contain I
 Concurred doctor. Those are danishes. She's a cheese. I think cream cheese danish. I think that's stepped on cheese danish. That's super
 That's a that's a classic
 Let's give one of those a whirl then, you know, and
 So see that up. She's making my drink. She's pouring espresso over ice into my little thing
 and then I see her like almost look over her shoulder at me and then she just pulls out like a bottle of water and
 Pours a bottle water into my thing for the water for the espresso. I'm fine with using bottled water for my water for my
 But curious that this is very fine station doesn't have working plumbing
 And she goes it's it's it's bottled water she's like it's it's good water I said no, no, it's good go help yourself go for it
 I'm happy. Everything's fine. And then I
 Said brown sugar cinnamon brown sugar was the name of one syrup. I was like, yes, let's do a couple pumps of that
 two pumps, please and
 She's looking around she's like turning around every bottle and she's like I found a sugar-free one. It's like don't
 Don't worry about it. Just I bet you I bet you have vanilla. Yeah, give me two pumps of vanilla
 I bet you know right where that one is, right? She goes. Are you sure because I have the sugar-free brown sugar cinnamon here
 No, no, no
 Did you find out if this was like somebody's kid or something was it was it take your kid to work day, what's that?
 Actually was using the kidnapped hand gesture and I missed it
 She kept asking you if you wanted an angel shot, it's quite possible
 There was a robber underneath the counter with a gun pointed to her the whole time
 You just weren't being nice
 You want sugar free? I?
 Think I have some more
 Pumping syrup with the brown sugar under the counter. I could just look under the counter
 If you take these out without paying for them they sometimes trigger a silent alarm
 I
 Have to come out now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry everybody. I have a gun
 The only thing I said I told this young lady was please don't tell this guy that I'm under here
 And that's the one thing you did I say I didn't
 Strongly implied I couldn't I just couldn't take it. Mr. Robber. Mr. Robber. I believe the second chances
 I have to go record a podcast. Anyway, I'm gonna leave and then you guys just start from one, you know
 Start from scratch when I go ahead. I don't even want to rob this place anymore
 I'm this is really just taking all this theme out of my sails
 The reformed robber
 Selective partners like the Helena Rubenstein foundation
 It's such a good feeling to know you're alive because I left you living though
 I was robbing you inside and I said, you know, not today. I will not shoot you then run away
 It's a good feeling a very good feeling a feeling
 You know that I'll be back to chase my fucking money bitch
 And if you don't have it this trigger is gonna itch and it's gonna go off and blow your head away
 I promise you ladies and gentlemen, welcome to mr. Robber's neighborhood. We're happy to see him
 He's just changed out of his sneaky clothes
 Wherever he goes near or far. I still don't know what danishes are
 What did you know so she goes to get the yeah the the French vanilla syrup right? Oh, yeah, here's the thing
 Baristas your syrup things you got to wipe or what if you have like the removable spouts you wash the spouts, right?
 Right if it's the pumps you still have to at least take it like a warm cloth at the end of the shift
 Or the beginning to shift to make sure you wipe those puppies down, right? Yeah wipe them puppies
 Mm-hmm. No, no, sir. Oh god. You saw the glomp just jizzes right in her own face. Just
 Like a joke at a naked gun, she just assaults her own face with
 Trying to make you a coffee man, she just wants you to have some coffee in a day
 Can I have some flavoring?
 Just and like literally was like I hate it's like literally with like syrup across her face goes like I hate these things
 Mondays am I right?
 And I was like been there girlfriend
 How do you think I started interning for Penn and Teller I
 Made them coffee. Can I tell you how I got these claw clackers? Let me tell you I
 Used to pick up pastries with my bare hands when I was first working here
 That was just a little too
 Grotesque of a thing to do so I I went ahead and got myself some tongs and I used those
 To pick up the bear claws and the pastries and the Danish and I was a fiend for the day
 Even though I didn't know what was in the Danish that was part of the fun picking up the Danish that I couldn't tell what was inside
 But I went ahead and ate it anyway
 And then I rigged all your fucking things to explode you
 I
 Was wondering where the story was going but now it was worth the monologue
 It was worth the fail they say he's a super criminal and I know I was the whole time
 I was like this doesn't sound terribly criminal at all to me, but then the ending though it took a turn
 It's all about the way like hide the syrup sheepishly showed me this container of cinnamon
 She's like this is like cinnamon and I go it is cinnamon
 It's like cinnamon. Yeah, she said it's like cinnamon and I was like like cinnamon
 I was like, that'll be great. You go ahead and you go ahead and clean your face. I'll throw some cinnamon in here myself. I
 Got it
 I don't believe that I can a good conscience ask you to do anything else for me
 I'm gonna see myself out. Please. Have a better day
 I don't want to leave this establishment with you having 10 drink additives
 Sorry splattered all over you because of my take that on my god
 No, this is just outrageous that she leapt onto the wall and stuck to it. Just
 You know who else thinks the walls when they jump at them

 Why don't we plug in the old game system, huh? And let's go to a place. We all know it love
 Vice City. Yes, let's all go to Vice City for a vacation where the toots are plentiful
 And they can be beaten for the money
 After you do it so much it sounds like a trap
 This is definitely a trap
 I'm not saying that that
 Grand Theft Auto the video game is any kind of secret government sigh up
 But I'm certainly not implying that the new Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to actually literally entrap people into
 Virtual game world where they will be unable to escape
 Where they will be actually shackled to the game for many many hours of their day playing it to earn real-world money
 only to just spend that on
 Food and water delivered to their home because they can't leave because they have to keep playing the game because they're gonna be the game
 You say it's not gonna be that though no way no way
 We're gonna be utilizing actual in live players
 replacing
 NPCs that would be uncatchable
 No way as long as you're not gonna do that. I'm fine with it signed off. Don't check out you tricked us
 You super nerd you tricked us good
 Ha ha ha ha take a vacation bitch
 So I was doing fair enough
 Ended up, you know, I put myself on all these different
 Websites trying to increase my corporate work for magic. Oh, did we ever get resolution on your?

 They put up a picture like this is who I'm going to bring in front of us at 10 o'clock at night in this private
 Suite and they say do you have do you have a cancellation fee? Yeah
 Nice, so you made a little money
 was it like I'm joining all of these sites to figure out my best practices and why I went through with this battery party was
 to make sure I could create a performance agreement Chad GBT and
 like basically ask my shame best practices and
 And just yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna hire an entertainment lawyer for my $300 gig
 I get you on that one, but still
 The AI zombies are coming for us all. Oh, they are. That's true. I'm terrified. That is true. Yeah, I don't disagree but
 So same on a different website. I ended up
 Just
 Agreeing to do a birthday party in Redlands, California about three hours away from us
 Same thing I was going back and forth the person signed up agreeing to do it. All right, and so I I
 drive out last Saturday to a party in
 the Redlands, California and a beautiful backyard for someone's birthday and
 I'm doing a
 Rope trick right and I say that my I have a magic wand and it's a giant bowie knife. It's an eight ten inch bowie knife
 Make jokes about a game through TSA blah blah blah blah blah, and I always had it someone
 right, you know and say
 Do you believe in the power of this magic wand right and then I have them?
 Turn two pieces of rope back into one pieces of rope mirror. Huh, right? Yeah, and I get up this
 Person who's honestly I believe presenting mail. So I watch my pronouns
 Okay, and they're also seem to be with someone who also seems
 gender fluid in the back, okay, and
 So I hand this person the knife and say do you believe in the power of a magic wand and she quietly?
 Dead-eyes me and says I believe in the power of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh
 Ridiculousness and I'll raise you
 Say, you know, you know, it's funny about knowing how magic tricks work
 It's I know yeah exactly I know how con artists work
 I want to be like you are surrounding yourself with self-hatred. Do you understand this? There's a place
 Where you are free to be whoever you want and that answers anywhere, but a church community
 Let's just go let's just go have a nice life
 Part get the car part of the whole religious thing like
 The self-hating thing is a is a real deal. Yeah, it's it's it's legit

 She was not old enough to be the mom of the she didn't say I'm Amanda's mom or anything like that. Oh
 Yeah, what did she have a beard that gave away like she had the same facial hair as the dad
 That's it
 Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's a key indicator. I mean, I guess Paul is just really holding me to the coals here
 I don't know. I
 Don't know is wait a minute. Wait a minute
 The last time I saw a birthday magician all he did was asking appropriate questions about family lineage. That's right
 This is like and his name was piff the magic dragon
 That is if you put on a dragon suit you can get away with more
 I want to end up following through with it
 You know, I did I said have you ever hired entertainers before and she said I have we hired a comedian
 It was not a good experience. Oh
 Go like oh gosh
 You know and that's it and making me and snare myself into saying like well I can make up for that guy
 You know kind of was this this is before you started your show you as you were meeting them as the booking. Yeah the booking
 Okay, so this is well, that's good, but you didn't just show up at their doorstep go
 Hey, you ever hire anybody to do stuff like this before?

 Chaotic runs writes in jet to be fair if a boy from Jersey thrust a boy knife at me

 You like absolutely Jason you suck, buddy
 No, no upside I don't think to knowing who it was and it's out in California, so I imagine if some guy from LA is actually

 That needs any more
 Explanation
 You know, I I hear you saying that
 But I I'm very curious about this accent, sir
 Listen, here's the thing about
 about the
 This is the thing about in my place, okay
 All of the artwork is a god. It's on a waist level. Okay, and
 it's all got holes in it where there's mouths or butts and
 That's what you can insert your stuff in now. I have not a lot let out of the ladies
 Either I have another forgot about the the ladies what I have another forgot about the the ladies. No, I mean, I'm curious
 Huh? I heard you. I'm curious. Well, how you plan to help the ladies? Oh
 the lamps
 And her hey scoops a check
 Those are choking hazards, oh you don't put them in your mouth I
 Mean you can you can all right? You can do anything you want that sweet relief. I don't care
 My whole house because it's my house and it's filled with the calm of a thousand strangers. I
 Don't I can't get I can't access the back of the paintings
 They're built into the walls
 This
 Legal
 That my home reasons they'll take over my home reeks of bleach and sour apples. It's just a bad scene
 it's I
 The walls weep you understand me. I
 Have to take a moist towel to most of the walls every morning to take away some of the seepage
 And it doesn't stop and keep sipping there's a girl who works at a coffee shop who's looking to get extra work
 Do you think you can help her out? Oh
 I love a barista
 Bring her over
 You should use socks says chaotic in chat
 Oh too late I've it's in the drywall I
 Really should just replace the drywall
 Look, my only good thing is
 That it's at waist level. So at some point I could cut it all away and put like, you know
 What they call that design what they call the waist level?
 beams
 When they go on, you know at this point in the big you're asking for architectural specifics. Yes
 Okay
 Asking for a chair rail
 That's exactly chair rail and runner board. Is that what it's called?
 Sure, okay, great
 Well, funny is I want to bring up something that Tim and I talked about but now I can't tell me this is episode
 Next episode next episode. Well, I want to bring up something real quick
 It's too late
 Bad pirate scoop
 Sent me an amazing an amazing gift from Australia. He is friends
 With a creator
 Called salt
 Andrew salt marsh, I guess is the
 creators actual name and he does this art by salt and
 He made these really cool stickers and sent them to me. They're all
 Crazy Star Trek themes. So this is a bat left in a piece of pie. This is a good day to pie
 Or a good day for pie
 This is a
 doctor
 Which I believe just says hey in
 Klingon like hey, what is the doctor for our audio listeners? Which a doctor is a
 Klingon dagger
 Okay, it's a Klingon dagger with the word. Hey on it. Yep
 This is a zombie hand giving the Vulcan salute and says live long on it
 Which is that is you were just flipping off the camera
 Yeah, and then this is a red shirt
 What remains of a red shirt with a damaged calm badge and blood all over it clearly the victim and then I got a couple others
 That are beautiful stickers. They are and I've already put them on a couple of them on
 some notebooks I have that I'm gonna be using for the
 the upcoming improv classes that I'm about to start teaching this month, which I'm really excited about and
 I just wanted to say thank you bad pirate
 for that gift and I am holding on to the letter and
 The envelope because it might be the last piece of international parcel that I received for some time
 Well, there you go, there you go, congratulations, where do you where you want us to support this person? Yes, I would say
 Yeah, check out art by salt
 Salt Andrew salt marsh is that individual? They're an Australian and
 yeah, you can go check them out and
 Yeah, that's it
 Does really great work so I was talking to Tim and
 We were getting it, you know, he's he's he's a total like audio nerd, right? Right. And so
 We were talking about like the recording of sound and basically like I alright cuz he has like the Beatles microphone and stuff like that
 Yes, right. Yeah. Yeah, he's got some real real interesting shit. Yeah, and he
 And basically we just get into it. I was like I basically was like I was like I've had many people who understand audio
 Explained to me how we actually record physical sound into an object which I still don't get no matter how many times people explained to me
 What happens and he says it's even crazier than that is that there's like a French scientist one of the first known people to kind
 of figure it out and
 He was recording sound into like, you know, like like like cylinders
 it wasn't it wasn't quite that was like it was a really like loose like metal material like similar I guess would be like
 Tin foil now, but it was kind of like a very very weak probably pewter pewter, right something like that
 Maybe I don't have to look it up, but a soft metal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and that's the song was also soft metal
 No, but um, yeah
 But the person's first known recording audio is by this French scientist
 We gotta get a soft metal Jacob Alvarez. He just whispers
 Jacob soft metal
 Quieter quiet softer
 That's better and but it's still just full volume music
 The music is still just blasted take my hand
 So
 This is not a heavy enough of a story to carry the bit but
 But so so he said the crazy way
 How to record stuff I haven't gotten to the punchline yet. We've done too many bits in between
 He was definitely the punchline is he was doing it before the phonograph
 So before we had an ability to listen to what we were recording this guy figured out that we could record
 Yes, I have heard about I have I've been told
 Several times about how we we figured out how to record
 Sound before we learned how to play it back and Tim couldn't believe that I found this to be hysterical
 I was like wait, it's like everyone's singing and playing and then some some nerds going like see the wrinkles
 It's here
 Can we hear it no, no you can't
 We don't have that kind of technology you fools keep playing though. It's making the coolest wrinkles. How long?
 how long between learning to record and learning to playback I
 Don't even know I don't you even like they discovered that because they discovered this guy's recordings later
 They didn't know at the time
 He had done it
 So it was like it was like seriously centuries later where they found the recordings and then found a way to play them and sure enough
 you heard the voice and music of like basically a popular song at the time in France, which is
 Baffles me that baffles me so much digital sound makes so much more sense to me
 then
 being recorded into a
 Piece of I don't know I can I can wrap my head around analog sound a little bit better because it is you know
 It's just it's a needle
 vibrating it's the actual vibration of of
 Stuff and then
 Well, I mean it's the vibration of the needle against the groove of the record then amplified through
 The air which is what's the only when you get right down to it if we didn't have air
 We wouldn't have any of this shit. Yeah, that is true
 Take that you people take care for granted because it's all got to go through the air and the compression of air, right?
 Yes, I mean, I think that's what that's yeah, he's getting all kinds of crazy shit. That's a that above my brain
 Capabilities like he's vibrating air is above your brain
 For it to be like centuries later for me to take a needle to it and go
 Oh, there it is and then hear it like what sure I don't know there was about a 20-year gap between
 Scott Scott Scott de Martinville
 patented the oh
 Boy, I don't even know how to say what that word is. It looks kind of like phonograph, but it is definitely not phone
 It's pronounced autograph, maybe
 graph
 And it could transcribe sound waves as a visual line onto a piece of paper
 but had no mechanism for playback Scott intended the recordings or
 Phono autograms for visual study rather than listening to it
 So he was trying to invent something that could record the the sound so that he could visually study
 Oh, and then Edison invented the phonograph about 20 years later
 Say was it called phono phono autograms?
 Yes
 Phone autograms is it phone autograms or phono autograms phone autograms?
 Phone autograph was the machine and phone autograms were the things that the machine made phone autogram is a wonderful
 Mr. Burns kind of line. He would know he would he would drop that
 Yes, Smith is I recorded this onto the phone autogram. Yeah, exactly
 I recall I I had a recording of this on phonogram when I was a boy
 When I was but an adolescent is
 That means 20 years that's like enough gap for the people to come back they're still living right think back
 Hey, right. We're really dicks to you back at that early recording party you had and
 Sorry, we haven't spoken in two decades since we ridiculed you but turns out you did and I have a recording of you ridiculing me
 We just figured out how to listen to it the world's first DJ the world's first DJ the world's first record producer
 Cuz that's what because we were talking about like basically that you had to play like such with such ferocity for the early
 Oh, it had to be so loud. It had to be out and then we figured it out later how to do it soft
 Like that's where you know, you're from from Bing Crosby to Sinatra to like that era of crooner
 Like we can't empathize with how much of a baby maker that was we cannot
 We can't go back in time to forget that we used to have to have such loud
 Things to hear it and all this everything had to sound like this because we were kind of shouting half shouting half singing me
 Am I baby? Yeah, and the very first time someone's like, you know, like the solitude
 You're like, oh my god
 That's fuck right now. Oh hard
 Knocked my son into next Wednesday for sassing off so hot being so yeah
 He made a wrong move at the corner of smart mouth and bullshit attitude
 so I had to correct that behavior a
 Wonder Bing's gonna be in Hollywood Squares at scoop fest. We'll have to find out who can say I don't know
 I'm really excited now now for those of you don't know we're I'm going in but lined on this
 So it's gonna be really really fun
 I can't wait to just not know what
 Impressions I'm supposed to do by the way scoop fest.com go check it out. Yeah. Yeah
 End of September end of the month this month
 Come on out to Las Vegas. It's gonna be awesome. It is
 Did you invite Tim to scoop fest? I didn't
 See now I actually mail specifically. I don't know Paul
 I know what you're gonna say, but I did in fairness to Matt already send Tim an email specifically tell him to stay the fuck away from
 scoop fest
 All right, I guess we don't want him is only really for one hot dog microwave er in this town. That's right
 After Matt told that story I just sent the email fun fact all you have to do to send Tim jenison an email is just
 Write Tim in the send bar and and it gets to it
 Who did I have laws dead? Laszlo might actually make it out to a scoop fest?
 Dead Laszlo come on. We love last-minute scoop fest tickets. Yep. Oh
 Yeah, come on out in the meantime we go play a little jock vs. Dirty
 Time
 Explosion
 Hey gang long time listener first time caller
 I made a scooper before you using questions that I pulled directly from a grade 4
 Brain quest that I picked up at a thrift store for those of you who aren't old
 Brain quest is a long skinny bundle of paper bound together with 1500 questions and answers
 Grouped into categories that was used to learn things in the pre-internet era. Hope you enjoy that's Johnny
 So Johnny made us a brain quest scooperty. Did you guys have brain quest? You guys know what that is?
 That's familiar. Well, it sounds like a
 Primarily Canadian thing since it was called grade 4
 No, no
 Canadian scoop crystal says I remember it first thing up in the chat. I'm telling you I remember
 Oh, I'm sure they made an American version. Nope. Jacob Paul gets full credit. You get none. Sorry buddy. All right
 Tough but fair. Hey the categories are before we get into the categories
 Let's say happy birthday to didgeridoo scoop one of my best friends. It's his birthday. Yeah
 Man, they buddy. Happy birthday didgeridoo
 Ah early days of this show having didgeridoo scoop make didgeridoo covers
 Famous songs. God damn the funny one of the best thing is that was ever done gold
 It's that is a truly gold bit. That is really funny shit. Yeah
 Talk about you
 So good so good
 It is right up there
 Science math geography and grab bad if you insist
 Matt you're up first. I will take math for 400, please
 Which is it the better buy three shirts for 978 or 335 per shirt. Oh
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see here. I
 Have to divide 78 by 3 here three goes into seven. That's two times
 Yeah, nine said three shirts for 978, please
 All right, three shirts for 978 less than that. It would be 10. Oh five the other way around. There you go
 Oh, that was an example of the
 dramatic
 Pricing that's gonna be going on as you shop now at Walmart
 I'm just gonna randomly check up everything that you buy. I'll go with grab bag, please
 For 400 and the song what color is the Rose of Texas? That would be yellow
 Yellow reading the question. I almost reflexively said what color is the yellow Rose of Texas hilarious?
 It's me I'll try science San Antonio stands for is yellow rose and of course the
 Arapahoe legend that the flower got its color from horses peeing on it. That's right
 That is what puts the yellow in the yellow Rose of Texas the yellow Rose of Texas is colored like that cuz it's pee
 That's right. That's how the song goes which two planets have no moons
 I
 Don't think mercury earth is one of them earth earth doesn't have any more moon is a myth
 Yeah, if you're flat, you can't have basically a spaceship. Don't sign twisted. Yeah, that's right
 Yeah, which two plants I think mercury is one and
 Let me see Venus or Venus has a moon my guess Jacob and I'm not sure I
 I do recall pretty recently one of the planets got
 Re-evaluated and basically called the moon. So maybe that could work
 Or not even called a moon called like a large body. Yeah, Pluto's like a large celestial body or writing. Yeah, so
 what do you think I think it is mercury and
 He gets shit
 this is an old book, I
 think it's mercury and
 Neptune I don't know. Wait. No, it's an old. Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. It's Pluto
 It's gonna be mercury and Pluto. I'm thinking
 Well, you know, I was wrong. So Pluto has moons. I don't know or
 Yeah, or already not a planet by them though, maybe
 Matt you're up. I will take
 math for 800, please
 The sum of 16 plus 5 plus 8 is the same as the product of 4 times 7 true or false
 Let's see here 16 plus 5
 that's 21 plus 8 is 29 and
 4 times 7 is 28. So it's false
 false is
 Correct 29 is not the same as 28. I'm literally showing my math. Are you smarter than a fourth grader? I
 Will try grab bag if you insist
 Here we go
 Long fellow wrote the song of Hiawatha. Is it a short story or a long poem? It is a long poem
 It is a long poem
 That's me I'll try math for 1200 Fanny. Well Hiawatha
 And how well is mighty warriors of 24?
 Let's see 24 divided by 8
 Thanks
 We're divided by oh wait, how do you do that?
 Multiply 3 times 8
 Right, oh that's right. Yeah, so that would be yeah, so
 3/8 of
 24 wait, I
 Am just so confused right now. I don't know why you did
 Make any sense at all
 No divide 24 by 8. Yes, that's what I was doing
 But then subtract 2
 Or it would be 12. So it'd be 9
 Yes
 Well done boy, it is hard to do math and pull telling me things already confused
 I will take math for tooth
 2000, holy crap using pencil and paper divide $50 and 40 cents by 14
 Matt do you have a pencil and paper handy?
 You have a calculator because that would work too am I allowed to use the calculator probably not
 Okay
 Let's do this. Okay, so I'll try by multiplying 14. So times 2 is 28
 which means times 4 is
 56 so it's somewhere between 3 and 4
 So if I say 3 point something something does that count for this this yeah to get us on with the game. Yeah
 3.6. Okay. There you go. Yeah
 Paul
 grab bag, please
 For 1200 name the main villain in the series of unfortunate events books uncle Olaf
 No count Olaf
 Count Olaf is correct. Save my butt. Oh
 Is he their uncle I don't know I think he claims to be their uncle and they that's the whole thing but yeah
 Oh, okay
 I'll try grab bag 2000
 What is a pistachio
 Ooh, oh like is it a nut or a legume or a berry is it a berry? I bet it's a bear our I bet it's a berry
 Because it grows on trees, right? So I think that I think that means it's a berry so I'm gonna say berry
 That's a nut
 Boo
 Matt ah, boo. All right, come on
 Guys, come on
 science science for 800
 Now for 3200 oh yikes I was doing so well
 You were which creates the fastest wind on earth a hurricane a cyclone or a tornado
 Oh, this is tough. Okay. Their tornadoes are tiny
 But they're tinier, but I don't know if that means their winds are less
 Force frame more. Well, I think technically a hurricane and a tornado are the same thing
 It's just one forms over water. Nope. No, I quote cyclone and hurricane are the same thing
 Tornado and a water spout are the same thing right because a water spout is a tornado over the water hurricane and cyclone are the are the different
 coasts
 For us, I believe so, right? It's and it's the rotation the way they're spinning, right?
 Hurricanes in the Atlantic and cyclones are in the Pacific. I think so. That's vaguely what I know
 So if her kids are suckers the same thing it has to be one thing so I'm gonna go with tornado
 All right
 It is a tornado juice look at you with the big brain
 I may or may not be currently helping a fourth grader with homework all the time. So maybe gives me an advantage
 But I'll try science for 1200 name the only planet that orbits the Sun on its side. Oh
 What but
 What does that mean I
 It means that other planets are not on its side and one of them is oh
 Wait what
 There's some planets because you have like you have the magnetic poles
 So I think that's what it's referring to is it referring to the axe the tilting of the planet
 Or is it referring to what side of the Sun it rotates around?
 No, because it rotates around the Sun it doesn't just rotate on one side I have to pass I have no idea
 Passes to me. I'm pretty sure it's Uranus
 It is Wow
 It's just like it's it's tilted way over on its axis interesting
 Okay, I think it's I think I think it's part of why Uranus has such an odd orbit
 Also, the planet goes around the Sun in a weird pattern. Okay
 Because of that because of its rotation, right and tilt on its axis interesting. Okay science for 2000
 All tropical fish live in salt water true or false. Oh, this is this is a tricky. Oh
 false
 It is false something's live in freshwater. There you go. There you go
 Matt you got geography that we have all avoided for four eight twelve and two thousand
 Give the word for the farthest edge of a settled territory
 Over yonder
 That's the ball border Oh
 Frontier ass
 Nope frontier
 Paul
 Can I try the 2000 just to try and win? Yeah, I don't even know if I can win you can't
 Shows the location of a city that is not a capital
 Go ahead Paul what map symbol Paul actually go ahead and just name a map symbol dots
 Letters
 I mean it's been an arrow that says city been a minute since I used a
 Map
 And it's not a capital. Oh
 You remember the old bit that was in like every third movie where you'd have a couple of people lost in a car somewhere
 And one of them would just pull out the biggest map in the world
 I would just keep unraveling the whole front seat wasn't that a good in Dumb and Dumber where they had to keep flapping open the
 Or not dumb. Yeah Dumb and Dumber. I think it was I don't know
 I'll have to pass because I really am at a loss. That's to me. I just I certainly don't know I'm at
 the location of a city that is not a capital it's just a dot
 microphone
 It's just a black dot. I believe I said dots
 You want to try black dot? Yeah
 All right a black dot and fuck me
 That was the first thing I said shit ass
 That's me I'll try geography for 800
 Put an order from east to west Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
 Alabama is the farthest east then Mississippi then Louisiana then Texas
 Alabama Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas well done
 Matt I'll take geography for 1,200 Jacob
 Which is the world's largest body of fresh water Lake Superior or Lake, Victoria
 Well, I have to guess here cuz I've won the game. Yes
 Yeah, you win no matter what I guess although if I pass who does it who's the pass to?
 Passes to Paul. Oh good. Then Paul can try to beat you for second place if I pass can I that's true
 Mm-hmm. I think yes, you can I'm 800 points ahead of you Paul. All right for game a $1,200 question for gamesmanship. I pass
 Paul I'll go Lake Victoria
 It's Lake Superior in Africa is second-largest Paul is wrong and that is the game
 Matt wins with 8400. I am in second with 2800 over Paul's best efforts
 He only got 800 points not my best efforts and that is from Johnny. Thank You Johnny
 If you want to Johnny Cooper tea, I've said as a price of striped Jack
 It's an obelisk jock versus nerds and it's all the things over at hey scoops comm go right there
 You can send some scoop mail over there as well right there on the home page. There are links for all those things
 There's also a link right there to buy some tickets for scoop fest. It's gonna be awesome
 And it's gonna should be there change there are less than three weeks away. It's happening
 fest
 Let's do it
 Let the panic attacks ensue Oh in four weeks, I'm gonna be so relaxed. Yes
 In a month, I'm just gonna be so relaxed. Exactly. Exactly. I want to thank all the people support us over on our patreon page
 Did you send lists or we don't have lists yet? We don't have lists yet. Ah
 Well, normally we'd be going to our list here to thank the people individually who support us at a particular level
 So if that's right haven't checked it out go over to preaching fun and select a level that fits your budget today
 Or if you like me are a little shocked that we didn't talk at all about the new Nebraska
 Re-release album that Springsteen is doing head on over to fartsinabag.biz
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preaching fun calm it takes you over to our patreon page
 We're for as little as three dollars a month
 You can help keep this show on the air if you like what you hear if you think it's worth more than zero dollars
 Head on over to preaching fun comm head on over to fartsinabag.biz
 Go to either one of them or go to both of them and make two accounts
 That'd be fine with me too. You can do all those things go over there. Keep this show running. It gives us
 Money to just keep the show going. I don't know how else to put that
 Let's do the show
 Yeah, pay for websites
 About to pay the Orleans a lot of money we are
