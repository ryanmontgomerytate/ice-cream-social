 Oh
 Hello there, I didn't see you there, but I'm so happy you're here
 I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers
 I'm recording this episode in the past, so I don't have a new list yet
 But thank you to each and every ice cream truck driver out there who knows by the time this goes out
 I might have added the ice cream truck driver names in
 Knows anything anymore. I think we should maybe do that for these day. Yeah, we're gonna try and do that
 We're never gonna try and do that if you want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I hope you do preaching fun dot coms
 We can go preaching fun.com head over there sign up to be an ice cream truck driver, and who knows the life you save
 Maybe your own
 Here's a program hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah? I'd love to great
 Let's go appear guys, and I'm sweaty. I'm fresh for my kids Christmas
 70s out there is it oh, it's it's obviously too warm
 It's time for that Maddly's ice cream social sitting over there a sweaty pool of his own mess
 That's Matt Donnelly singing Pittsburgh. It's automatically in Vegas. It's me Jacob the audio guy. We're preaching fun
 Yeah, this is week
 Three for me where we've had snow and I can't go out
 It's fucking freezing cold, and I can't go out and clean up the backyard from the dog poop and with four dogs
 Pooping all the time. It's a lot of dog poop
 And so when I go out to do anything in the yard like change up bird seed or anything that Anne needs me to do
 So I try to stay the hell out of the backyard when there's nothing but dog poop, and it's freezing
 I have to come back in and spend another ten minutes cleaning my shoes off from all the skank that gets on my shoes
 I'm trying super careful. I try to dodge it like landmines. I can't miss it
 If you have there's an amount of dog poop in your backyard that it is impossible for you to walk around it
 It's close because they like that area that leads right up to always one spot. It's kind of makes more kind of a zone
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. No the entirety of my backyard is not filled with dog shit
 I'm like, holy Jesus man. How often are you cleaning? I'm cleaning every week, but this is two weeks in a row
 I haven't been able to so right. It's a lot. It's a backup, but it's also frozen
 So what are you gonna do? I got to invest in some new fucking boots
 But yeah here I am start a business of frozen dog poop pickup for other people's houses
 Gross. Yeah. No, thanks. Did I tell you guys actually had a couple kids come by?
 Back when we got our first like three inch hit and they just rang the doorbell. Hey, can we clean your driveway off?
 Yeah, I'll give you a three inch hit right now. They said can we clean your driveway off for a little bit of money?
 I said hey house 20 bucks. They're like, let's get it. Let's do it and they did it and it saved my fucking hole
 It's like this is amazing. This is the
 America I'm telling you this is what it's all about. But here I am
 Freezing my took us off and then I read Vegas is having record high temperatures. Oh record highs
 Yes, so while you're in the middle of a triple volt
 polar vortex yes is
 Which is a very rare event, but it's caused all of the Arctic atmosphere to moot descend upon your your town
 Descend upon rural, Pennsylvania. We are slowly building an El Nino over here
 Which is creating warming temperatures and bringing them over here to create one of the most warm and dry
 Decembers in Vegas history. Yeah, it's the combo you want. Yeah
 So this this Saturday love it dry El Nino or El Nino. I forget which one creates it warm El Nino
 Versus the polar vortex the battle for the century
 Let's go
 Warm and dry was actually the original name of Matt Mattingly and it is the primary designation for the kind of sex robot
 You want that is, you know, the first and foremost is it warm and dry?
 just torso and
 Torso warm and dry torso by Matt. I
 Just I just got back from my kids Christmas concert, and I say concert because basically say my air quotes
 yes, because this is a music program and
 a couple things one is that this year out of nowhere someone started a
 Cheerleading program at the school to teach kids how to cheer. I
 Thought you're gonna during the showcase. There was some kind of weird
 We're sitting there. Go music. Go music go music. I don't know
 So that's it. So they never have had a cheerleading program before no, no, no, but it's important to teach
 Coeds first through fifth grade. I believe it was all girls in it. I did not see a boy in it
 They were gonna they were gonna make it coed, but they decided that Matt's son would be too good
 Another thing as soon as they say they didn't want to well Keillor's the kid cheer captain now, right? I mean that's that's cool
 He was going up on you Paul Keillor's growing up on you, buddy
 He's not in that school anymore. Keillor's gonna come back and be the coach. He's in a different school
 Yeah, oh no, baby's baby's getting old I got it wrong as that yeah La Nina not El Nino
 Yeah, is that a
 Directional wind declination. What's the difference? I'll give you a directional wind
 Is a Madonna title, right? Yeah, it's like El Nino. Yeah
 and so before
 Before the concert was to begin we had to do 15 minutes of just watching them do cheers for cheering sake
 Do cheering was it at least Christmas theme cheers? Nope
 You just watched children just go like yo be aggressive be
 Aggressive. Yes
 Like just watch that for 15 minutes. I would categorize this as like a sneak attack, right? Like the parents are gathered
 Yeah, no one knows about this truly program of audience
 This is a violation of the Geneva Convention and then I'm like, but I got you guys all hyped up right? I mean
 Sweaty right I said I spent walk 25 minutes home. I was so pumped. I
 Think this thing is working
 Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. Cuz basically once once that bumped the concert time. I was like, well now
 I'm not gonna make ice cream social on time
 I was like basically I waited the one part that I knew my kid had
 Watched it and was like snuck out the back and then great was like I'm gonna walk home so that my wife can see
 The whole thing. Uh-huh
 It took me a really long time to figure out that your text said that you were that you had to ditch your wife
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it didn't say you had to ditch your wife. It said he had to I know I
 Know that was it. That's yeah
 That's why I'm so happy for your wife. And that's why I put exclamation points because he said you had to dick Sarah
 Oh my goodness
 Sorry, I'm running late getting back the concert ran long I had dick Sarah we understand me right there
 Context clues, but it's still very funny
 Yeah, I even put a capital D on there look at that
 You put a capital D on that all the marriage is anything like mine when that happens it's capital D that kind of day I
 Mean we're getting close to the holidays so we're due, but we'll see
 Is your birthday that's fucking great. Yes, so
 Who am I kidding everyone goes over the holidays we can't but
 But
 So then they go to this this music program right where they they sing some songs, but then they also do this thing
 This is like some innovation. They had a few years ago and what happens is they do like a creative writing
 storytelling time you
 So then they select like three or four, I guess I don't know ten just it felt like it felt like a million
 But I stayed for four
 These stories that the kids have written together
 There are Christmas themed stories and all the instruments on stage instead of creating songs for the Christmas concert
 creates sound effects for the
 Oh, that's the worst
 Terrible, I'm watching some avant-garde children's foley exercise. Do they intentionally add lots of sound effects to the stories?
 See I did this as a little kid I think I've told you guys this before my dad wrote a program on our Atari 400
 That was sound effects
 Okay, and you can play all kinds of different sound effects through the program
 Yeah, and so I recorded myself a story about mr. T and Lee majors going to space
 Yes, and I used all those sound effects as a young aspiring radio guy and Foley artist myself
 Well, don't get me wrong. I loved doing Foley stuff too, and I liked doing it with friends as well
 I don't think it should be done for
 200 parrots
 But I'm sure the comedy and timing of it was just spot-on
 And I don't know if maybe seven demos is worth the idea of showing off this Foley expertise
 Down to one or two of the best ones and then present those seven different stories
 Yeah, well, they did more how long a story I did I did they're like five minutes six minutes
 What yes, that's not no you do a story by cheer a story that a cheer a story than a cheer break it up
 Figure it out. Nope
 Three Christmas songs and seven stories. That's what you get here Christmas songs. What were the Christmas songs negotiation went worse than Ukraine in Russia
 Well, it's okay Israel's gonna pay for it. That's right, huh?
 Yeah, what were the Christmas? Oh, well first like Oh Christmas tree
 Okay, Christmas tree wasn't owned honing ball. I have issues with Oh Hanukkah Oh Hanukkah
 Let's light the menorah that song wait at what they do a version of Christmas tree. That's Oh Hanukkah
 There's another song called like Oh Hanukkah Hanukkah. We'd like the menorah
 Hanukkah you guys don't even know the song I'm talking about. No, no, okay
 I think this is a children's school song that has that has come up to
 Include everybody it's abominable. I
 mean like the snowman it is like it seems like it was in inspired by someone like
 fever fever chopping wood
 It was like the melody they came up with for it was like chop chop chop chop chop chop chop. No
 And and I guess it's like the first songs that was like a first included but like everyone Christian schools
 Like I guess we have to sing Hanukkah songs
 And they've included this about it. Leanne can stop and chat. Yes. This is about Israel
 Listen you can't say that the Jewish people run show business and then also put out that terrible song. You can't have it both ways
 Either you're in charge of everyone's beautiful music career. You can come up with a better melody then
 Than that there there are there are other beautiful Hanukkah. They just don't want Mariah Carey running away with all the publishing rights
 But yeah, so
 It's it's it's it's a terrible song and they sing it or I guess yell it or shout it
 It doesn't there's no way to unshout it. It's just shouting
 It's and do they play instruments to where the kids just sing it they play instruments, too
 Okay, that makes it worse. It does make it worse and yeah
 And and like it might as well like be done to like like the Ramones like they might as well have like a punk drummer
 just driving they don't do like klezmer and and
 Juice harp and all that kind of thing. They have every instrument out there Paul. I don't know if they're all done in a way
 That makes it satisfying to the year
 Authentically Jewish in nature of these there's marimbas and chimes and wood instruments and all kinds of stuff out there. It's a couple laptops
 Try to get all Beastie Boys on it
 Laptops going on
 They're running tape. He got straight-up DJs DJs on the wheels of steel the ones and twos. Yep
 but I
 Was like what kind of avant-garde artsy shit am I watching?
 There is nothing that makes me want to have kids less than than children's musical events. Oh, I
 Know it's the worst dance concerts concert concerts all of it. It's just terrible
 Oh, this is and this is just this is just for the parents people who don't have kids won't get this but
 Going to see different productions kids productions is torture enough
 But if you kind of don't plan it correctly and you don't realize it, but you go in the last one. Oh
 It's a huge mistake
 What do you mean at the end of the last one? They're gonna get up and start thanking all the people that helped out and put in
 So you stay for an extra half hour 45 minutes of terrible? Thank you speeches that mean absolutely nothing to you. Yeah
 it is just
 It is it is not
 But a huge thank you to dr. Stevens dr. Stevens, which are you here? Are you here? Dr. Stevens?
 Ladies and gentlemen, dr. Stevens came to the children
 Three times a week for the last five weeks to help them prepare this side, right? Yeah, let's hear it for dr. Stevens

 He did his hey, baby aggressive dr. Stevens be
 Team go go go. Hey, where's my let's bring out my instrument people. Let's do our dr. Stevens medley that we came up with

 Yesterday I went into work. I I got up and I wasn't I wasn't feeling good in the evening
 and then I wasn't feeling good in the morning and I pushed myself to go on and head to work and
 I drove to the end of our
 Neighborhood and I paused for like 20 seconds and I almost just turned the car around because I was feeling so crappy and I was
 Like no just go to work. Just do it
 And I did it and then I was there for about 45 minutes and I started really feeling terrible
 Like I was gonna pass out getting like cold sweats. I don't know. What was the food poisoning or something? I don't know
 But I went I told him I gotta I gotta get out of here so I
 Left yesterday and today
 I stayed home today just to make sure I could get some rest and feel better and I do feel better
 So no, it wasn't an Aldi hot dog this time Mike. So anyway yet
 Yeah, I was like all the hot dogs chase any germs away. I was just beat and I needed a break

 But Jeff Loomis in the chat is saying that you do look tired. I and and yeah, Jeff is right
 Paul honestly looks like shit. He's sitting there and he just looks terrible
 You should have seen me yesterday. I really did look I looked the site
 I'm feeling a little bit better now, which is good. So it's got a two more days and then I can take a little break
 I didn't want to say Haggard, but now that you brought it up
 Call me Merle cuz I'm Haggard
 That's a joke that everybody gets and dead Lazlo says I'm just sick of work I could sympathize and it's true
 I am fucking sick of work
 Work is awful
 Especially worst time right here. You're in the height. You're in the height of it's it's crazy right now. Yeah, it's really crazy. But
 Yeah, I just needed a fucking break. Oh, I need to go to the sweat house. That's right Leon. Well last night I
 Was invited to City Cast Las Vegas is just a social
 Community gathering nice. Oh, how nice and so they invited us out to a place called the crush pad
 It's a gathering of podcasters. Just podcast listeners. Just just members. Oh members sponsoring members
 And and so we were out of the crush pad and
 The wine bar the wine bar and it was a delightful little wine bar met the owners
 they had a tastings of
 Four wines that were exquisite
 Okay, and then I was laughing because I
 also ordered a little a little prosciutto appetizer and then I went ahead and got myself a
 Glass of their they have a chilled red house
 wine
 Nice and I was like, yeah, let's do that
 And then the person in front of me ordered two glasses of wine and I got two raffle tickets
 And then the person told me gave me their what gave me my wine and then walked away and I said
 The fuck yeah, I said, excuse me. Do I get a raffle ticket and she did even like oh
 You ordered the house
 Wine so no. Oh
 and I
 Laughed what do you have to order to get a raffle to I have to really?
 Was like I saved a few bucks by going with the house and then it's like when I give you a fucking tote bag
 Don't you feel stupid after four bucks next time you cheapskate, huh? Yeah, it's Christmas season. Don't be a Scrooge get some good wine
 Yeah
 Then I laughed and then the person who ordered the wine said I didn't know
 The rule so I didn't mean to walk you into that trap
 So I said, okay and then out of guilt she's like never mind you can have but you can have a raffle
 And she gave me the raffle ticket
 And I'm talking to my friend there is
 You know, we're so we're the social addicts. So the guy who walked me into that trap we joked and we
 Set down with them. We had a little wine him and his wife two doctors in town and
 And I said if I win this raffle, I I obviously will will refuse to take it
 I will I will I'll yield it back to the story. I didn't qualify properly for it. I
 Can't I can't possibly everyone know like any cheapskate can win one of those
 What is that a coffee mug give me that give me that outrageous this is for people who won a good
 Good cabernet. I'm sorry, sir. This is for customers not freeloaders
 But I did I met the I also had another awkward interaction there I was there and I looked at this woman
 Well, that's awkward and I looked at her name tag and I was like I said you'd look familiar and she goes shit
 She got me like a weird look. She's like
 What like what and I was like, I don't know. I was like basically like do you want to help me out here?
 Kind of like do I familiar to you?
 There's the regular dance of do I look familiar do it and she goes you're probably gonna say I look like a singer
 I go. Oh, well, okay
 I work in town, you know showbiz maybe maybe maybe she's cross paths and she goes yeah
 No, I'm not that singer
 And then like went away like half annoyed
 And I
 What a weirdy and I said like she went away is half of a Domino's advertisement from the 80s
 The person next to me. I was like I didn't even bring up the singer part. She did
 I only said yes to the singing part because I thought we were trying to figure out how we knew each other
 I thought you were helping me out
 He's like no, you just think every black woman's a singer go fuck yourself. You racist is basically what happened there
 That's what it was. Yeah, so we did not hit it off. That was I
 One strike on the socializing for the for the for the city cast Vegas outing there. Oh
 That's and that is too bad because that is the person that we brought in today to interview for this. Hello. Hello miss
 So you you met Matt Donnelly last night. Did you? Oh, no
 Yes
 And and you did not care for your interaction with Matt Donnelly
 Hey, are we actually recording on this? Oh, we're recording right now, buddy
 Okay, let's do this. I'm here. Am I sounding okay on this?
 Beaming that's Rob. We're doing it. We're in the middle of a bit, but Rob Rob is here. Hey
 Rob, I was just talking about being a city cast Las Vegas social gathering last night. We're already rolling
 I know I could sense the excitement in your voice
 Recalls the big event. That's what that was. I
 Will say I'm gonna burn you guys right now
 You guys handed out conversation starters last night to people as they walked in
 We sure did and I am laughing because I have inside information on your company that you guys are allowed to be a little
 Political, but you're not supposed to be like a politically leaning podcast organization, right?
 We get feedback every now and then from upper management as well as the audience
 What I like to say is city cast is for everyone if you love Las Vegas or love to trash Las Vegas either way
 We have a home for you. Great officially. Welcome Rob from city cast Las Vegas. Thank you
 And hey Las Vegas newsletter editor and I appear occasionally on the podcast
 Yeah, just to clarify absolutely great job on both your newsletter is outstanding. I think you did an amazing newsletter
 I think some of my favorite things that you guys make the Nevada Independent and the Las Vegas Review Journal look like
 You might as well just light dog poop on fire and ring their doorbells. You're embarrassing them. You are embarrassing them
 Well, we link to them sometimes. Yeah, we got we got a tip ahead to them
 you know, we just kind of like to collect what everyone's talking about add a little bit of our own stew to the mix and
 or mix to the stew your way, but it's we slide into your inbox at 6 a.m
 every morning and give you a quick look at what's going on in Vegas. So here is the
 Everyone loves Las Vegas icebreaker. You guys hated me when I came with a party last night. Okay, great
 What's should we should we have the conversation based on this card now?
 This card says what's your ethical responsibility as a citizen when you believe your country is acting immorally. That's your casual
 Icebreaker for me to just talk to any citizen of Las Vegas
 That is a little few people
 That's a literal icebreaker
 Has to switch out today. Ah
 Some did yes, I don't want to talk about nature Rob. This doesn't have to be a God chosen journalism moment, but this has David Figgler written
 All over it. This is Figgler all over it. I
 Think it was more like we have what we call a membership team
 Helps us organize these events because it was for city cast neighbors. That's our membership group. That's right
 And you know, we were kind of worried, you know, cuz some of these people, you know, they want to get out and about they want
 To meet new people so we don't want it to be, you know awkward
 So sometimes, you know, we had a couple games out like you know and stuff
 But nobody even had to open them because everyone was naturally organically making conversation and mingling
 so it's true the icebreaker card was part of that and I think a few people used it but not everybody did but it's a
 Good way just to welcome people and get them thinking about something straight off the bat. It was it was a
 It was a landmine and the people that I met but yeah, we moved on anyway
 So you did get some Intel and asked the question to it. I did I did I did fitting off with the with two doctors
 Let's let Daniel and Christine. I think
 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're doctors and
 I'll vouch for them. Yeah. Yeah, and they did it
 There I just say yes, I mean if we're not for your newsletter Rob
 I wouldn't know things like the Taco Bell ultra run which is coming up in a couple of weeks here
 Actually, it's coming up Saturday Saturday. Oh, it's the Saturday. All right
 Where people run from Summerlin to Henderson and stop by seven Taco Bells and have to eat a Taco Bell menu item at each
 One of the things we do at City Cast Vegas is we do events we compile events and it's kind of like a guide to
 The week and I was coming across this thing called the Taco Bell ultra marathon
 I'm like that looks boring some another marathon sponsored by some
 Corporate entity and then I looked at it and this isn't sponsored by anybody at all. This isn't
 Roots thing that a person came up with who was in an organization here locally called
 I believe the Las Vegas slow runners. So, you know, there are people who want to be out and about but it's kind of like all skills and
 Let all skill levels welcome and the whole idea is you start at a Taco Bell in
 Summerlin you end up at a Taco Bell in Henderson and you stop at five others along the way
 This is more than 30 miles. This is why I didn't feel this was a real event
 I'm like, yeah like this is a joke for people who don't know
 Henderson and Summerlin are on opposite sides of the city of Las Vegas
 They are they are two just neighborhoods basically on the east and west sides of the city
 It's not even easy to run between the two takes a while. Yes. Oh
 Driving between the two is a nightmare running between the two full of Taco Bell seems like a hellscape
 Right. So there's there's some guide guidelines and even experienced runners. I did talk to someone involved
 So I knew this was legit and they're like, you know, I'm a runner myself
 This will probably take me like eight hours some people may be five some people may be longer
 But also I think some of the participants might just do like two or three Taco Bells
 I think the real serious ones are the ones who are like doing the whole thing
 I'm a Taco Bell 5k guy. I'm not a Taco Bell
 I can I think run from one to the other and then call it a day
 But you have to eat something different at each Taco Bell
 Wow can't repeat and then you have to eat the whole menu item
 Yes, and you can't run with it. You have to finish it and then go
 You can't just eat like a bite of a taco and then head out. You got to eat the whole taco
 Exactly. And I'm also there's a 15-minute penalty added to your time if you throw up
 This is a real rule. That's fine. There is a 15-minute in this race
 There is a 15-minute penalty for that in life. There is a much bigger penalty for it if you don't throw up though
 If it wants to come out let it come out
 And again just to let you guys know city cast is legit
 I reached out to the slow runners and the person's person's personal
 Instagram page trying to get them on today's podcast and could not reach them
 But you got you got the interview you got that you got the facts there
 Yeah, so I ended up talking to someone who's actually making the official t-shirts
 So if you go on their website, they have an official t-shirt for this unofficial Taco Bell event. Holy smokes
 One of the Taco Bells is right on the corner from my house
 You should just go and hang I know I was like
 One of those tables like cups of water maybe there was water
 That'd be a bucket ready for anyone who's ready to you wouldn't bring water 15 minutes. I have 15 minute penalty buckets waiting for them
 Little cups of Baja Blast. That's what you got to have
 Last bonus you can there's two bonuses
 One is you can add Diablo sauce to everything and do a Diablo sauce shooter at the end
 Oh, I think it's just drinking a packet fine
 Fine, and the second one is you have to commit to drinking at least two liters of Baja Blast. Oh
 over the seven locations
 So what's that equate to like four larges or something like that? It's about two liters. It's about half a dozen
 Vomits six. Oh, this was invented by someone who loves Taco Bell and hates running. There's no no, you know, this actually
 Happened in a couple other cities. Apparently this is an annual tradition in Denver
 I think they're the first ones to come up with it and just a few weeks ago. There was one in the DC area
 Yeah, just by coincidence the CEO of CityCast David Plotz
 He saw my story sent me a note and said his son ran in the DC version
 And complete it October. I
 believe it was late November
 Okay. Okay, great. Maybe Denver was October. Maybe I don't know the website I found it says
 50 kilometers nine Taco Bell meals across DC. Well, yeah, it's insane even worse than the
 Yeah
 Seven miles while stopping at nine Taco Bells
 That makes me want to do that and
 The idea is you wear costumes and kind of have fun with it. Sure. And it's all a trust system, right? Yeah
 And you went over and taco at the end if you're first. Oh, oh
 Come on
 Burying the league being a golden taco winner is pretty great
 Yeah, great
 That goes right on the intro to everything I do after that, you know
 No matter what I'm doing
 That should be on front page in the RJ golden taco winner is
 All right, and I don't know what it is I asked my contact who is part of this
 Who's making the shirts and I said, what is the golden taco? And she said I don't know
 So it's a little bit of a surprise for whoever gets it. All right
 Rob I gave you I gave you 12 hours
 I gave you 12 hours notice on the spot to do a year and hours of sleep
 Yeah, exactly
 And he does last night. I challenged you to come on here and I wanted the top three
 underreported Vegas stories for 2025
 Yes, now when I asked you that just pop in your head right away or did you was it hard to come up with?
 No, cuz you also gave me the option for the five overall news stories of the year
 Yes, and I said well three sounds easier than five
 And I think my first option will make you grow and you'll be like you didn't put much into this
 But I want us to think about I want I want us to think about the the year
 So far looking back. It's been a it's one of those years. It kind of feels like two years
 It doesn't really feel like all this was one year lots been going on
 But what do we remember as the first do you guys remember what the first big news story of the year is from?
 January of 2025
 Yes
 No, no, I don't remember what the first news story of December I guess this election shit
 Are we talking just Vegas maybe somewhat indirectly just Vegas, right?
 Just Vegas. Yes. Yeah, I'm thinking from now. I'm on the outside in PA now getting still
 I still have lots of feeds coming up. My first thought goes to the boring company increasing their
 presence
 They Elon Musk tunnel company. Yeah
 Okay, any any other?
 Guesses I guess there was a bunch of protests stage in January, right?
 And we we have a bad we have a bad record with how we handle protests. Are we there?
 There's always a protest about something every day this story. I'm gonna give you a hint. Okay, so was explosive
 Explosive explosive news story. Oh was this the the the Tesla truck that blew up at Trump's tower
 That's right happened. People forget this it happened on January 1st. Oh my god five New Year's Day
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this was the Tesla cyber truck that the guy blew up like in the valet parking area of the of the Trump Tower
 We're in Vegas and he was in it, right?
 Yeah
 he
 Blew up along with the Tesla. Yeah, he drove to be clear. He wasn't he didn't blow it up by accident
 He meant to blow it up. Yes. Yeah, this was an act of terrorism. This was an attack. Yeah. Yeah
 Yeah, it wasn't like, you know the accelerator like right, you know
 I don't think they have those in Tesla's anyway, but yeah, so this guy drove from Colorado Springs rented the Tesla and
 You know, he came pulled up. I'm learning right now that it was a rental
 This is what you get from CityCast that's right details, yeah, I mean you're not gonna blow up your own
 You know replacing the batteries
 So if you do survive, you know, you want to yeah that explains why somebody else's car
 My my rates at budget and hurts went up last year that explains it. I think this had something to do with it
 Yes, he used Turo. You know what Turo? Oh, yes
 You are oh, it's sort of like I don't know. It's kind of like almost we thought about getting into this when it was brand new
 It's the uber of rentals. I think yeah
 Yeah, you can like sort of like your car, right? Yeah, it's a car sharing that actually does make it more fucked up because everyone running
 A Turo usually owns like one or two cars for Turo
 You know, it's basically like how we all can run our own rental car company
 So that means if people used to do this with the condos
 Yeah, so this means that person really did blow up someone else's like really that was a really expensive hundred thousand dollar
 Tesla Cybertruck, it's kind of it's kind of like an extra fu, you know
 I'm gonna ruin this guy's car
 But yeah pulled up to the Portico share the valet and you know what?
 I think is kind of under reported about this story is yeah got a lot of attention at the time
 But you know when the person responsible dies, you know, you don't really get to follow up on motives
 You don't really get to follow up on you know, what was behind this right and you know, there was sort of I mean the guy
 had a history in the Special Forces with the US Army and
 You know, there were sort of like questions over his political leanings
 And if that had something to do with it or if he's just having
 You know a bad time in life and is coping with this and maybe had some mental health issues
 Sure, but the fact that you know, this is happening at the Trump Tower
 which
 you know coming right after a very contentious election and
 The Trump presidency was there some drama around that I miss that yeah, you may have heard
 This president again, so I have not been following the news closely. Yeah, so
 You know, but it's also makes you think about how easily it is for kind of what could be considered an act of terrorism to take place
 At a Las Vegas landmark, right? I mean pull up into a valet. So you kind of wonder about okay
 What's happening since then to account for this kind of stuff to catch people before they take this kind of action and how do you increase security?
 Remember there was that crash that happened in front of Planet Hollywood a few years back
 Yeah, and and now because of that because they ran into tourists walking on the sidewalk now you have the you know
 The pillars the ballasts, I believe yeah
 They're concrete ballasts that are along along the sidewalk blocking off the the sidewalks from the road now
 Because then the crash referred to is over. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're everywhere now and they and they came up quick
 They grew out of the sidewalks
 Right, we gave birth and planted the seed and a screw. That's the company. I should have started the ballast company
 I would have made a fortune. Yeah, I think especially in this town
 So I mean Vegas is always looking at ways to improve security
 Chat is yelling at us bollards. Yeah bollards not ballast ballast at the bottom of a boat bollards are the things on the side of the road
 Yeah, it's not like my business is words or anything
 We'll edit this in post right these microphones are decorative. Yeah
 So I thought that's a somewhat under-reported story mainly because it's been forgotten. Yeah, you're right
 I totally haven't thought about that forever and it happened in my own backyard and
 I didn't connect it to all of the bollards that are around
 Here or ballasts or ballasts or ballads for the people's standing in front of building singing to make sure you don't crash
 Your car they just sing slow songs
 She's not that singer I don't know
 No, I have so I have a second story that the second story kind of follows a similar theme
 we're gonna kind of go and flow between one story and another but
 Have you noticed anything about Metro police this year? I
 Mean, they're super nice and polite and don't give out a bunch of fuck you tickets. Oh
 Wait, no, I'm wrong
 They've handled I think they've handled the arrest of some of our friends very well
 You know people have you had to bail out people? No, we're good friends with Jimmy Sonina who had that terrible
 There you have protest. Yeah, you got arrested for some nonsense. Yeah, right
 So, you know the one thing I've noticed about Metro this year, which has gotten some attention
 I think it needs to get a little more attention. Okay, the way this fleet is expanding
 Just the technology they're using
 I think you may have seen the hoopla over their big
 Cybertruck speaking of which cyber truck patrol fleet. Yeah, some guy gave him a bunch of cyber trucks
 Yeah, and how much do you think those fleet of cyber trucks cost? Oh
 Oh gosh, I I bet with the retrofitting and stuff that they're doing to the cyber trucks
 They've got to be $200,000 a piece where they got to have bulletproof
 stuff in them and all that kind of 200,000
 Elon Musk tried to
 Speaking of things that we forgot about remember when Elon Musk debuted the cyber trucks and threw a big steel
 Ball-bearing at the back windows to show off the bulletproof glass and it wasn't bulletproof glass
 So he just broke them on stage at the unveiling. I do remember that they just went. Oh well
 Yeah, they're like oops and they did it again on a different window. That one also wasn't bulletproof
 Ten of those. Yeah, that's the ones for us. So some guy bought a bunch of Tesla cyber trucks for Las Vegas Metro Police
 Ten or fifteen of them. This was nearly three million dollar donation from a tech investor
 Ben Horowitz who is
 with a venture capital firm
 Anderson Horowitz, so good guy and yeah, but this isn't the first time he's donated to Metro
 do you
 Do you remember the other forgotten story this year of remember the guy who set Tesla cars on fire?
 Yes at the dealership
 Yes, yes, which was like a protest
 Right and he was caught but Metro said, you know, we wouldn't have caught him without some of this new technology
 We have specifically license plate readers that are now throughout the city
 And there's a back there's about a hundred and eighty of them
 Oh, it's at least at the time that we did the story and those cost about six million
 And who do you think paid for those this guy Horowitz?
 Yeah, Wow, so this is not get a lot of speeding tickets
 Mr. Horowitz person well now correct me if I'm wrong Rob, but are not the very legality of those devices still in contention
 You I mean you can definitely make from a privacy privacy violation
 I mean, do you want to be tracked? You know your whereabouts going because that's how they were I'll answer. No
 Okay, that's the question interesting interesting. Yeah, but the way they sort of get around this is I believe they make the donation to
 Sort of like a third-party like fraternal order of police type of thing and then it kind of goes through that way
 You know if this guy was really in some kind of legal trouble
 What would happen right you're donating millions and millions to make?
 You know Metro police
 in theory more successful more like a an army unit, but
 You know what happens if you commit some major felony commit? I'm not saying this guy's a bad guy at all
 Maybe he's a great guy. No, but you know there it works in some protection. It is weird. You know makes you it makes you pause
 Yeah, is there any other?
 Motive like in other words like just just just spitballing. I mean I like I like why would a guy spend over 10 million dollars to
 Quote-unquote make the city safer, but basically to give Tesla trucks and surveillance equipment to one city
 Like what what's it? I don't understand any time. There's a side for him anytime. There's a data collection element
 That can be monetized, so he's not doing this out of the goodness of his heart
 There is money to be made with that license plate data. That's what I'm asking right. I don't know exactly
 I don't know exactly what or is it even probably you could probably know you can probably figure out a way to measure like cars
 Mileage and all that kind of thing there their MPH or MPG, you know ratings and things like that
 What is the ascent of your armpits have to do with anything Paul?
 I don't know I always have something to do with it balance for a man, but made for a lady
 No, it's all it's all crazy. I saw a tick-tock recently where someone was talking about this very thing
 And it's not about the billionaires accumulating all this wealth at the end of the day
 Yes, that's kind of a sickness and a weird symptom of it all but the accumulation of the wealth is
 Secondary to their end goal, which is becoming above the rules of normal society
 Right and how better to become above the rules of normal society than by purchasing the people who enforce the rules of normal society
 I mean this literally is like like Batman comic-villain level. It is right frightening where you're like
 Oh, I just did a Google search on this guy. Apparently he's opening a new nightclub in Las Vegas. It's called Horowitz Island
 And apparently the police are just not paying any attention to it at all. Okay good
 The big the big the big innovation of the nightclub is that you don't get carted at the door. That's right
 Technology that allows you to not be carted at the door. Basically a teen club
 The teens seem awfully old to be hanging out there
 Allegedly
 I'm sure is a great guy, but it's not just cyber trucks. It's not just the license plate readers
 There's also a fleet of drones now. Oh, no that mr. Horowitz says the drones kill me
 Well, the the one day maybe yeah. Yeah, it's true. That that's such a weird thing. Oh
 And if you look at it, you know, if you just kind of who's our governor right now Joe Lombardo
 Yeah, and what did he used to be? So, I mean chief of police getting your influence
 Where you can you know, it could be very valuable depending where people end up in public office. Yeah. Yeah, I
 But that you're right. This is next level bizarreness
 I had no idea it was just one person footing the bill in a donation role to create this kind of
 militaristic
 approach to policing is
 The are the cops at least flexing on safety. Are they flexing on any kind of statistics to back up any of this?
 Cause I'd be more afraid they're flexing on people he'd or if it's the
 Right. Well the sheriff right now is
 You know running for reelection he's saying murders are down I believe but these are all stats you can count them how you like
 but you know what happens if there's a greater for example ice presence in Las Vegas and
 We are experiencing right now
 Right and but it could get really bad in theory like some other cities and what happens when the governor gets involved or the sheriff gets
 Involved and now you start mixing politics with influence
 and how
 Much to resist this kind of stuff or get involved in it. It just raises a lot of questions and hypotheticals. It's not great
 It's not it's not a good look. It's it's the what's what's the the thing?
 You want you we want to avoid the the appearance of impropriety and this this certainly does not avoid that appearance
 That's what I'm trying whether there is that's what there is any impropriety or not. This looks shady as fuck
 That's what I'm poking at Jacob is like, of course hearing this you make you go like yikes, right?
 but like our what is the counter and that's I mean, that's what's actually I've been fascinated by a
 lot of these terrible things that are happening in the country is that that doesn't even even seem to be a
 Quote-unquote company line that people are hiding under anymore. People just say like, yep. It's terrible. We love it. We love terrible shit
 Like I don't I don't if you're not doing anything wrong you shouldn't be worried about it
 So, yeah this guy is someone in chat saying that he invests in in in in
 Flock safety the I guess that's the company that tracks license. Yes, that's the license plate gotcha
 so the racer slash reader slash so he is he's getting data to
 sell
 This that's it. Yeah, he's like we get we get to be his demo city. Although in Vegas
 We're so many cars without a license plate. You're gonna lose a chunk of data
 We just stepped up the thing about to call people out on that
 Rob is the one who reported that let me know that was working there. The tattletale line is working. Mm-hmm
 Have you ever you weren't working working? I don't know. It's generating more tax revenue for the state
 Gary Rob, that's what I want city cast to crack
 I want you to do either an article or a podcast with just tattletailers what they get out of it why they're doing it
 Have you have you encountered anyone who's called in anyone on the line like like a guide on how to narc
 Yeah, like no. No, I want to hear from the narcs. I want to hear from the well
 My favorite narc is that you can report on people who have smog issues with their car
 There's an actual program Matt what's your license plate up
 Corolla smog out of this well
 Can't tell me those guys working in the smog shacks aren't just as soon as somebody fails and heads off on their day
 They're not jumping on the horn and oh, yeah, I got a tip
 I don't think they get like a cash reward. Oh, well, then maybe they're not doing
 Your neighbor it was like aluminum cans like you get ten cents. It's like it's a really nominal fee
 golden taco
 So, I guess we're just at the beginning of what this means Rob, right?
 We don't know what this actually is going to entail. We haven't seen police drones in action yet. Have we?
 I think they're more of like a glorified delivery service right now where they are at different stations
 And then they can kind of go and maybe scope out an area before the actual officers arrive
 Oh, well, it's kind of a monitoring thing. All right
 The I I just picture I believe three four of them coming up to me while I'm on my walk at night
 Just shooting lasers at me is what I'm picturing. Yeah. Well, it's coming next
 To be unveiled at CES and truly if you're making
 Drones for metro services the way you're gonna sell more of those drones is to have the predator style three laser
 Dots that you can project on people while they're on their late-night walks
 Yes, the sign of you will you will sell a fuck ton of those drones to all of these police departments
 If you just put those three lasers on it. Yeah
 Was that all three was that was that -
 That was - I know they kind of run together and probably feel like one big story
 But let's go with what we all want to talk about Elon Musk Tesla Tunnels boring company
 We've talked about it a lot at CityCast in some way
 It's kind of our lane, but we've teamed up with ProPublica twice now
 Wow, and I'll tell you ProPublica ProPublica does not mess around that
 They are very serious and diligent about what they do a big shout out to David Figgler our host
 Yes, and lawyer not our lawyer but a lawyer who really is curious about this stuff really digs deep into it and finds the
 Things that not a lot of other people find out about so you are right. This is definitely under reported
 I don't think people are talking about this at all on a national level and
 This company is running a muck like a bad
 Like action TV show where someone has no regard for the law and just keeps ignoring. Oh, it's fine
 It's really like yeah commit violations now deal with it later
 They've had warnings. They've had
 But in the latest, I mean we reported I believe it was like over a thousand since they started and then
 Or excuse me over a hundred thousand dollars in fines from Nevada OSHA for some safety violations
 And that was last year
 This year we were reporting that
 Kind of think of what it well it did illegal dumping was one of them they were yes, they were yeah, so kind of by where
 Historic commercial center is I was put historic in front of that's a very kind way to
 Branding I spent so many years in that spot in historic commercial center. Yes. Yes in the historic onyx theater
 The historic
 Hawks syringe syringe is historic
 Green door
 For me
 History is made at Hawks gym
 But you can have that to be your new slogan by the way you'd have that for free history is made at Hawks gym
 I mean it is historic and how many clothing optional all-male 24-hour gyms are there in this country?
 But I'm sorry, let's stay focused here Rob
 Let's stay let's stay underground with these tests
 so now we reported there was
 almost 800 environmental regulations over the last two years alone and these were sort of for like
 Digging without approval and releasing untreated water into like city streets which go back into our water system, right?
 And there was a case where would you mean like untreated waste water from their machines and things like that?
 Like right water water that they've been using not just water that they found underground somewhere and they're dumping it like
 It's not like they just found a pocket of water like they're bringing all this water in
 Diluting chemicals and yeah, they're doing all this stuff within the just dump it in the street, right?
 And you do go underground you come across water and that kind of thing
 but you know, there's also waste from just use right and
 You know, they just seem to be drilling full speed ahead and worrying about
 the repercussions later
 There's some questions about transparency
 We had a congresswoman Dina Titus on our podcast at City Cast and she said she wants to see
 Governor Lombardo just open up the transparency of the meetings that are taking place with state officials and the boring company
 Because they're sort of allegations that they're kind of getting some preferential treatment as far as you know
 Covering this stuff up and not being so transparent about it and kind of giving them some more chances than another company might get
 But you know, there's been agreements
 There's been allegations of the agreements being broken and just fines left and right
 But this is a company that has a lot of money at their disposal
 Elon Musk is on pace if not already to become the world's first trillionaire. He has money to burn and
 couldn't have a nicer guy
 This all is for something that
 I know your insider Intel said we shouldn't be as
 Impinionated but I think the boring company the boring tunnel and the boring company and what they're doing under Vegas is an incredibly stupid
 Public transportation. Yes. Yes. The end goal is not
 It doesn't justify the means at all
 Like who cares taking traffic above ground and putting it underground the same exact tunnels
 Could have been a subway or some kind of large-scale people mover
 why
 In the name of technology, we're just putting taxis underground putting Disneyland style conveyor belts underground
 Where people could just walk down there and then stand on the conveyor belt would have made more sense than this
 I would have taken that over this. Yes, you know just by the way, I'll still take that over this
 If somebody has the conveyor belt technology that they want to put in those tunnels today. I'm fine with
 I just sold that company to make bollards
 If somebody could really
 Short what's there with the monorail system?
 If only they could expand on the monorail system
 But that monomaniac it's gonna get completely demolished at a certain point Monterey right because there's no
 You don't have the replacement parts for the monorail. So now it's outdated
 So once it does bite the dust, we were we're stuck with it and can't fix it. Yeah, so maybe we'll have like Tesla's driving themselves
 Tesla does have like a subway car train type of thing that operates in Europe somewhere. I believe I saw this story
 I'm like wait, they actually can do this too. Why aren't they doing that here in Vegas?
 And now their latest idea is well, what if we take the Tesla's?
 Underground put them above ground and now they can go to the airport for five bucks and we're like, okay
 That sounds great. That sounds like a taxi with a super discount price. Mm-hmm. That's not new tech
 Yeah, Tesla operates a battery-powered shuttle train the giga train in Germany for its gigafactory in Berlin
 Yeah, providing where's our train? Yeah, that's just like this just makes a lot of sense. Yeah
 I said exactly that was exactly what uber did bitch. Where's my giga train is where I'm pumping it out. We are
 Uber came in with a problem with saying no. Yeah, and sometimes we should say no and say hey
 How about what you're doing in Germany? Let's do that. Yeah for sure
 Was there any?
 Understanding of what that big green goopy pile of gunk was there was that weird mystery lake that they yes speaking of
 Discharged water. Yeah
 Yeah there I mean
 It's funny because I think so much of the attention was how security handled that story
 So at their new station that they're building at the old firefly song if you remember that place on paradise
 I so their latest arm top is heading out. It's heading out towards
 UNLV so, you know, it's kind of gonna give some accessibility to like the sphere area and all that but there's
 construction happening and there's a little kind of pool of greenish water out there and
 When a local station, I believe that was the CBS
 KLAS affiliate here try to take some video of it what you're allowed to do from the sidewalk. They
 Security shooed them away tried to cover it up. So, you know, if there's nothing wrong with that you would think well
 Why are you trying to do that? I'm not gonna totally jump to conclusions and just go with the headline
 Yes, it's a little weird and suspect but you know, it's up to them to explain what this is
 And from what I've seen so far, they really haven't
 Green pool of sludge in the middle of the city is I heard on that video that they made them delete was
 Four turtles eating pizza and fighting each other get out of here
 Right out of the they were using taekwondo. I think taekwondo turtles
 All this in the name of having 12 cars drive you from one hotel to another underground
 I know I would like Metro to take their drones and fly above this pool of green water. Yes, exactly
 Let's go Lombardo fire them up. I'm a little visit. Yeah, the giga train in Germany carries 500 people per trip
 Just saying it's a lot more than four. Jesus. Yeah, that sounds convenient. Doesn't it? Yeah, it really does
 Mm-hmm. If only somebody had come up with the idea to put a train car underground like a a sub
 Train way. Tell me they couldn't refit the monorail. They could refit the monorail make it work
 Yeah, that's my vote. No glory in it. No ego in it Paul. There's no ego in it
 Look at the giga train on the monorail tracks and expand it. Yeah, just bring it done
 Yeah, bring it to where it needs to go Rob
 Thank you so much for giving us an awesome top 300 reported stories of 2025
