0:00:04 --> 0:00:10
I didn't see you there, but I'm so happy you're here. I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers

2
0:00:10 --> 0:00:12
Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers

3
0:00:12 --> 0:00:15
I'm recording this episode in the past so I don't have a new list yet

4
0:00:15 --> 0:00:20
But thank you to each and every ice cream truck driver out there who knows by the time this goes out

5
0:00:20 --> 0:00:23
I might have added the ice cream truck driver names in

6
0:00:23 --> 0:00:28
No one knows anything anymore. I think we should maybe do that for these two. Yeah, we're gonna try and do that

7
0:00:28 --> 0:00:29
We're never gonna try and do that

8
0:00:29 --> 0:00:34
You want to be an ice cream truck driver, and I hope you do preaching fun comms

9
0:00:34 --> 0:00:40
We can go preaching fun comm head over there sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows the life you save

10
0:00:41 --> 0:00:43
May be your own

11
0:00:44 --> 0:00:53
Here's a program. Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social? Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

12
0:00:53 --> 0:00:56
I'm here guys, and I'm sweaty

13
0:01:04 --> 0:01:08
Seven days out there is it? Oh, it's it's honestly too warm

14
0:01:10 --> 0:01:15
It's time for that Madly's ice cream social sitting over there a sweaty pool of his own mess

15
0:01:15 --> 0:01:22
That's not not only singing Pittsburgh. It's automatically in Vegas. It's me. Jake of the audio guy. We're preaching fun. Yeah, this is week

16
0:01:24 --> 0:01:29
Three for me where we've had snow and I can't go out

17
0:01:29 --> 0:01:35
It's fucking freezing cold and I can't go out and clean up the backyard from the dog poop and with four dogs

18
0:01:36 --> 0:01:38
Pooping all the time. It's a lot of dog poop

19
0:01:38 --> 0:01:45
And so when I go out to do anything in the yard like change up birdseed or anything that Anne needs me to do

20
0:01:45 --> 0:01:49
So I try to stay the hell out of the backyard when there's nothing but dog poop and it's freezing

21
0:01:49 --> 0:01:55
I have to come back in and spend another 10 minutes cleaning my shoes off from all the skank that gets on my shoes

22
0:01:55 --> 0:01:59
I'm trying super careful. I try to dodge it like landmines. I can't miss it

23
0:01:59 --> 0:02:05
You have there's an amount of dog poop in your backyard that it is impossible for you to walk around it

24
0:02:05 --> 0:02:13
It's close because they like that area that leads right up. Oh, it's one spot. It's kind of makes more kind of a zone

25
0:02:13 --> 0:02:18
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No, the entirety of my backyard is not filled with dog shit

26
0:02:18 --> 0:02:23
I was like, holy Jesus. How often are you cleaning? I'm cleaning every week, but this is two weeks in a row

27
0:02:23 --> 0:02:28
I haven't been able to so right. It's a lot. It's a backup, but it's also frozen

28
0:02:28 --> 0:02:31
So what are you gonna do? I got to invest in some new fucking boots

29
0:02:31 --> 0:02:36
But yeah, here I am start a business of frozen dog poop pickup for other people's houses

30
0:02:36 --> 0:02:40
Gross. Yeah. No, thanks. Did I tell you guys actually had a couple kids come by

31
0:02:40 --> 0:02:45
Back when we got our first like three inch hit and they just rang the doorbell. Hey, can we clean your driveway?

32
0:02:46 --> 0:02:48
I'll be a three inch hit right now

33
0:02:48 --> 0:02:51
He said can we clean your driveway off for a little bit of money? I said hey house 20 bucks

34
0:02:51 --> 0:02:55
They're like, let's get it. Let's do it and they did it and it saved my fucking hole

35
0:02:55 --> 0:02:58
It's like this is amazing. This is

36
0:03:01 --> 0:03:03
America I'm telling you this is what it's all about

37
0:03:03 --> 0:03:09
But here I am freezing my took us off and then I read Vegas is having record high temperatures

38
0:03:10 --> 0:03:14
Oh record highs. Yes. So while you're in the middle of a triple volt

39
0:03:15 --> 0:03:17
polar vortex, yes is

40
0:03:18 --> 0:03:24
Which is a very rare event, but it's caused all of the Arctic atmosphere to move to send upon your your town

41
0:03:25 --> 0:03:30
To send upon rural, Pennsylvania. We are slowly building an El Nino over here

42
0:03:30 --> 0:03:37
Which is creating warming temperatures and bringing them over here to create one of the most warm and dry

43
0:03:37 --> 0:03:42
Decembers in Vegas history. Yeah, it's the combo you want. Yeah

44
0:03:42 --> 0:03:48
So this this Saturday love it dry El Nino or El Nino. I forget which one creates it warm

45
0:03:48 --> 0:03:53
El Nino versus the polar vortex the battle for the century

46
0:03:53 --> 0:03:55
Ding ding ding ding ding. Let's go

47
0:03:56 --> 0:04:04
warm and dry was actually the original name of Matt Mattingly and it is the primary designation for the kind of sex robot you want

48
0:04:04 --> 0:04:07
That is, you know, the first and foremost. Is it warm and dry?

49
0:04:08 --> 0:04:15
Just torso and just torso warm and dry torso by Matt. I

50
0:04:15 --> 0:04:20
Just I just got back from my kids Christmas concert and I say concert because

51
0:04:20 --> 0:04:26
Basically say my air quotes. Yes, because there's a music program and

52
0:04:26 --> 0:04:32
a couple things one is that this year out of nowhere someone started a

53
0:04:32 --> 0:04:36
Cheerleading program at the school to teach kids how to cheer. I

54
0:04:36 --> 0:04:39
Thought you're gonna during the showcase. There was some kind of

55
0:04:40 --> 0:04:45
We're sitting there go music go music go

56
0:04:46 --> 0:04:52
I don't know. So that's it. So they never have had a cheerleading program for no

57
0:04:52 --> 0:04:58
No, no, no, but it's important to teach coeds first through fifth grade. I believe it was all girls in it

58
0:04:58 --> 0:05:02
I did not see a boy in it. They were gonna they were gonna make it coed

59
0:05:02 --> 0:05:06
But they decided that Matt's son would be too good

60
0:05:06 --> 0:05:12
Another thing as soon as they say they didn't wanna. Yeah. Well Keelers the kid cheer captain now, right? I mean

61
0:05:13 --> 0:05:14
Cool

62
0:05:14 --> 0:05:16
Kiela's going up on you Paul Kiela's grown up on you, buddy

63
0:05:16 --> 0:05:21
He's not in that school anymore. Kiela is gonna come back and be the coach. He's in a different school

64
0:05:24 --> 0:05:31
Yeah, oh no, baby's baby's getting old I got it wrong is that yeah La Nina not El Nino

65
0:05:31 --> 0:05:35
Nina yeah. Yeah, is that a

66
0:05:35 --> 0:05:36
Directional wind

67
0:05:38 --> 0:05:41
Declination, what's the difference? I'll give you a directional wind

68
0:05:44 --> 0:05:49
What is a Madonna title right? Yeah, it's like El Nino. Yeah

69
0:05:50 --> 0:05:52
and so before

70
0:05:55 --> 0:06:01
Before the concert was to begin we had to do 15 minutes of just watching them do cheers for cheering sake

71
0:06:02 --> 0:06:08
Do cheering was it at least Christmas theme cheers. Nope

72
0:06:13 --> 0:06:19
Children just go like you know be aggressive be aggressive. Yes

73
0:06:19 --> 0:06:25
Like just watch that for 15 minutes. I would categorize this as like a sneak attack, right? Like the parents are gathered

74
0:06:25 --> 0:06:28
Yeah, no one knows about this shooting program of audience

75
0:06:29 --> 0:06:35
This is a violation of the Geneva Convention and then I'm like, but I got you guys all hyped up, right? I mean

76
0:06:35 --> 0:06:37
Look at him he's high

77
0:06:38 --> 0:06:40
Look how high he is sweaty

78
0:06:42 --> 0:06:45
Sped walk 25 minutes home. I was so pumped. I

79
0:06:45 --> 0:06:47
Think this thing is working

80
0:06:47 --> 0:06:53
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Cuz basically once once that bumped the concert time. I was like well now

81
0:06:53 --> 0:06:55
I'm not gonna make ice cream social on time

82
0:06:56 --> 0:07:01
I was like basically I waited the one part that I knew my kid had watched it and was like snuck out the

83
0:07:01 --> 0:07:05
Back and then great was like I'm gonna walk home so that my wife can see the whole thing

84
0:07:07 --> 0:07:12
It took me a really long time to figure out that your text said that you were that you had to ditch your wife

85
0:07:12 --> 0:07:16
Yeah, yeah, it didn't say you had to ditch your wife. It said he had the I know I

86
0:07:17 --> 0:07:18
Know that's yeah

87
0:07:18 --> 0:07:23
That's why I'm so happy for your wife and that's why I put exclamation points because he said you had to dick Sarah

88
0:07:24 --> 0:07:25
Oh my goodness

89
0:07:28 --> 0:07:32
Sorry, I'm running late getting back the concert ran long I had dick Sarah

90
0:07:32 --> 0:07:36
We understand right there because we understood your context clues, but it's still very funny

91
0:07:38 --> 0:07:41
Yeah, I even put a capital D on there. Look at that

92
0:07:45 --> 0:07:52
Man you put a capital D on that all the marriage is anything like mine when that happens. It's capital D kind of day

93
0:07:55 --> 0:07:59
I mean we're getting close to the holidays so we're due but we'll see

94
0:08:06 --> 0:08:09
That's fucking great, yes, so

95
0:08:11 --> 0:08:14
Who am I kidding everyone goes over the holidays we can't but

96
0:08:17 --> 0:08:17
But

97
0:08:18 --> 0:08:23
So then they go to this this music program right where they they sing some songs

98
0:08:23 --> 0:08:28
But then they also do this thing. This is like some innovation. They had a few years ago and

99
0:08:28 --> 0:08:31
What happens is they do a great of writing

100
0:08:31 --> 0:08:32
storytelling time you

101
0:08:32 --> 0:08:33
Know

102
0:08:35 --> 0:08:40
Sounds terrible already. So then they select like three or four

103
0:08:40 --> 0:08:46
I guess I don't know ten it just it felt like it felt like a million, but I stayed for four

104
0:08:48 --> 0:08:50
These stories that the kids have written together

105
0:08:51 --> 0:08:58
There are Christmas themed stories and all the instruments on stage instead of creating songs for the Christmas concert

106
0:08:58 --> 0:09:01
creates sound effects for the

107
0:09:01 --> 0:09:03
Oh, that's the worst

108
0:09:04 --> 0:09:06
I'm watching some avant-garde

109
0:09:06 --> 0:09:13
Children's Foley exercise do they intentionally add lots of sound effects to the stories?

110
0:09:15 --> 0:09:17
See I did this as a little kid

111
0:09:17 --> 0:09:23
I think I've told you guys this before my dad wrote a program on our Atari 400 that was sound effects

112
0:09:23 --> 0:09:26
Okay, and you can play all kinds of different sound effects through the program

113
0:09:26 --> 0:09:34
And so I recorded myself a story about mr. T and Lee majors going to space yes, and I used all those sound effects

114
0:09:35 --> 0:09:39
As a young aspiring radio guy and Foley artist myself

115
0:09:39 --> 0:09:43
Well don't get me wrong. I loved doing Foley stuff, too

116
0:09:43 --> 0:09:47
And I liked doing it with friends as well. I don't think it should be done for

117
0:09:49 --> 0:09:50
200 parents

118
0:09:50 --> 0:09:55
But i'm sure the comedy and timing of it was just spot on

119
0:09:58 --> 0:10:05
And I don't know if maybe seven demos is worth the idea of showing off this Foley expertise

120
0:10:05 --> 0:10:07
Oh boy

121
0:10:07 --> 0:10:13
Maybe pair it down to one or two of the best ones and then present those they did seven different stories

122
0:10:13 --> 0:10:19
Yeah, well they did more how long a story I did I did they're like five minutes six minutes

123
0:10:21 --> 0:10:23
What yes, that's too much

124
0:10:23 --> 0:10:29
No, you do a story than a cheer a story than a cheer a story than a cheer break it up figure it out

125
0:10:30 --> 0:10:38
Three christmas songs and seven stories. That's what you get here christmas songs. What were the christmas songs negotiation went worse than ukraine and russia

126
0:10:38 --> 0:10:41
This is a very terrible negotiation happening

127
0:10:42 --> 0:10:45
Well, it's okay israel's gonna pay for it. That's right

128
0:10:46 --> 0:10:50
Um, yeah, what were the christmas? Oh, uh, well first like oh christmas tree

129
0:10:51 --> 0:10:58
Uh, okay was it oh christmas tree was an old honing ball. I have issues with uh, oh hanukkah

130
0:10:58 --> 0:11:00
Oh hanukkah, let's light the menor that song

131
0:11:00 --> 0:11:04
Wait, what they do a version of a christmas tree. That's oh hanukkah

132
0:11:04 --> 0:11:08
There's another song called like oh hanukkah. Oh hanukkah. We light the menor

133
0:11:08 --> 0:11:11
Oh hanukkah, you guys don't even know the song i'm talking about. No, no

134
0:11:11 --> 0:11:16
Okay, I think this is a children's school song that has that has come up to

135
0:11:16 --> 0:11:19
Include everybody it's abominable

136
0:11:19 --> 0:11:24
I mean like the snowman it is like it seems like it was inspired by someone like

137
0:11:25 --> 0:11:29
Uh a fever fever chopping wood. It was like the melody they came up with for it. It was like

138
0:11:31 --> 0:11:31
No

139
0:11:32 --> 0:11:35
And and I guess it's like the first songs that was like first included

140
0:11:35 --> 0:11:38
But like when christian schools were like, I guess we have to sing hanukkah songs

141
0:11:39 --> 0:11:43
And they've included this about it. Uh, leon can stop and chat. Yes. This is about israel

142
0:11:44 --> 0:11:44
Um

143
0:11:46 --> 0:11:53
Listen you can't say that the jewish people run show business and then also put out that terrible song you can't have it both ways

144
0:11:54 --> 0:11:59
Either you're in charge of everyone's beautiful music career. You can come up with a better melody

145
0:11:59 --> 0:12:00
than uh

146
0:12:01 --> 0:12:03
Uh than that there there are there are other beautiful hanukkah

147
0:12:03 --> 0:12:09
They just don't want mariah carey running away with all the publishing rights. That's all

148
0:12:10 --> 0:12:12
Uh, but uh, yeah, so

149
0:12:13 --> 0:12:17
Um, it's it's it's it's a terrible song and they sing it or I guess yell it or shout it

150
0:12:17 --> 0:12:20
It doesn't there's no way to unshout it. It's just shouting

151
0:12:20 --> 0:12:26
That's just do they play instruments too or the kids just sing it. They play instruments, too

152
0:12:26 --> 0:12:29
Okay, that makes it worse. It does make it worse and um, yeah

153
0:12:29 --> 0:12:34
And and like it might as well like be done to like like the ramones like they might as well have like a punk

154
0:12:34 --> 0:12:38
drummer just driving the whole they don't do like klezmer and and

155
0:12:39 --> 0:12:42
Jews harp and all that kind of thing they have every instrument out there paul

156
0:12:42 --> 0:12:46
Uh, I don't know if they're all done in a way that makes it satisfying to the year

157
0:12:46 --> 0:12:48
Somewhat more authentically

158
0:12:48 --> 0:12:54
Authentically jewish in nature of these there's marimbas and chimes and wood instruments and all kinds of stuff out there

159
0:12:54 --> 0:12:58
It's a couple laptops chimes trying to get all beastie boys on it

160
0:12:59 --> 0:13:01
Laptops open a couple laptops going on

161
0:13:02 --> 0:13:03
They're running tape

162
0:13:03 --> 0:13:08
He got straight up djs djs on the wheels of steel the ones and twos. Yep

163
0:13:09 --> 0:13:10
but

164
0:13:10 --> 0:13:13
I was like what kind of avant-garde artsy shit am I watching?

165
0:13:14 --> 0:13:20
There is nothing that makes me want to have kids less than uh than children's musical events. Oh

166
0:13:21 --> 0:13:26
I oh it's the worst dance concerts concert concerts all of it. It's just terrible

167
0:13:26 --> 0:13:29
Oh, this is and this is just just and this is just for the parents

168
0:13:29 --> 0:13:34
People who don't have kids won't get this but uh going to see different productions kids productions is torture enough

169
0:13:34 --> 0:13:39
But uh, if you kind of don't plan it correctly and you don't realize it but you go in the last one

170
0:13:40 --> 0:13:42
Oh, it's a huge mistake

171
0:13:42 --> 0:13:45
What do you mean at the end of the last one?

172
0:13:45 --> 0:13:48
They're going to get up and start thanking all the people that helped out and put into the

173
0:13:49 --> 0:13:55
So you stay for an extra half hour 45 minutes of terrible. Thank you speeches. That mean absolutely nothing to you. Yeah

0:17:22 --> 0:17:23

212
0:17:23 --> 0:17:25
I drove to the end of our

213
0:17:27 --> 0:17:29
Neighborhood and I paused for like 20 seconds

214
0:17:29 --> 0:17:33
And I almost just turned the car around because I was feeling so crappy and I was like no

0:17:33 --> 0:17:35
Just go to work

216
0:17:35 --> 0:17:37
Just do it

217
0:17:37 --> 0:17:42
And I did it and then I was there for about 45 minutes and I started really feeling terrible

218
0:17:42 --> 0:17:47
Like I was gonna pass out getting like cold sweats. I don't know. What was the food poisoning or something? I don't know

219

237
0:18:56 --> 0:19:00

Especially the worst time right here. You're you're in the height. You're in the height of it's it's crazy right now

239
0:19:05 --> 0:19:07

240
0:19:09 --> 0:19:11
Yeah, I just needed a fucking break

241
0:19:11 --> 0:19:14
Oh, I need to go to the sweat house. That's right leon

242
0:19:14 --> 0:19:21
Well last night I uh was invited um to uh, city cast las vegas's just a social

243
0:19:21 --> 0:19:24
Community gathering nice. Oh how nice?

244
0:19:24 --> 0:19:28
And so they invited us out to a place called the crush pad

245
0:19:28 --> 0:19:35
It's on this is a gathering of podcasters just podcast listeners. Just just members. Oh members sponsoring members

246
0:19:37 --> 0:19:40
Um, and uh, and so we were out of the crush pad

247
0:19:41 --> 0:19:43
And the wine bar the wine bar

248
0:19:43 --> 0:19:47
And it was a delightful little wine bar met the owners

249
0:19:47 --> 0:19:52
Uh, they had uh tastings of of of four wines that were exquisites

250
0:19:53 --> 0:19:54
okay

251
0:19:54 --> 0:19:57
and then um, I was laughing because I uh

252
0:19:58 --> 0:20:01
Also ordered a little a little prosciutto appetizer

253
0:20:02 --> 0:20:06
And then I went ahead and got myself a a glass of their they have a chilled red house

254
0:20:07 --> 0:20:07
wine

255
0:20:08 --> 0:20:11
Oh nice and I was like, yeah, let's do that

256
0:20:11 --> 0:20:15
And then the person in front of me ordered two glasses of wine and I got two raffle tickets

257
0:20:15 --> 0:20:21
And then the person helping me gave me their what gave me my wine and then walked away

258
0:20:21 --> 0:20:22
And I said

259
0:20:23 --> 0:20:27
The fuck yeah, I said, excuse me. Do I get a raffle ticket?

260
0:20:28 --> 0:20:30
And she literally went like oh

261
0:20:30 --> 0:20:32
You ordered the house

262
0:20:32 --> 0:20:34
Wine, so no

263
0:20:34 --> 0:20:35
oh

264
0:20:35 --> 0:20:36
and I

265
0:20:36 --> 0:20:40
Laughed what do you have to order to get a raffle ticket? I have to really hard

266
0:20:40 --> 0:20:42
I was like

267
0:20:42 --> 0:20:47
I saved a few bucks by going with the house and then it's like we're not giving you a fucking tote bag

268
0:20:50 --> 0:20:56
Don't you feel stupid spend an extra four bucks next time you cheapskate, huh? Yeah, it's Christmas season

269
0:20:56 --> 0:20:57
Don't be a scrooge get some good wine

270
0:21:00 --> 0:21:03
And then I laughed and then the person who ordered the wine said I didn't know

271
0:21:04 --> 0:21:07
Uh the rule so I didn't mean to walk you into that trap

272
0:21:09 --> 0:21:13
So I said, okay and then out of guilt she's like never mind you can have you can have a raffle

273
0:21:16 --> 0:21:16
Ah

274
0:21:17 --> 0:21:19
And then she gave me the raffle ticket

275
0:21:20 --> 0:21:23
Charity raffle ticket and then talking to my friend there is it was I met you know

276
0:21:23 --> 0:21:26
We're we're at a social addict. So the guy who walked me into that trap

277
0:21:26 --> 0:21:29
We joked and we we ended up sat down with them

278
0:21:29 --> 0:21:32
We had a little wine him and his wife two doctors in town

279
0:21:32 --> 0:21:38
And uh, and I said if I win this raffle, I I obviously will will refuse to to take it

280
0:21:38 --> 0:21:44
I will I will I'll yield it back to the store. I didn't qualify properly for it. I just give

281
0:21:44 --> 0:21:51
I can't possibly everyone know like any cheapskate can win one of those

282
0:21:52 --> 0:22:01
What is that a coffee mug give me that give me that outrageous this is for people who won a good uh, uh

283
0:22:02 --> 0:22:06
Good cabernet. I'm sorry, sir. This is for customers not freeloaders

284
0:22:10 --> 0:22:12
But I did I met uh

285
0:22:12 --> 0:22:17
I also had another awkward interaction there. I was there and uh, I looked at this, uh woman

286
0:22:18 --> 0:22:22
Oh, that's awkward and I looked at her name tag and I was like

287
0:22:22 --> 0:22:26
I said you'd look familiar and she goes. Oh shit

288
0:22:26 --> 0:22:28
She got me like a weird look. She's like

289
0:22:28 --> 0:22:30
What like what and I was like

290
0:22:30 --> 0:22:35
I don't know. I was like basically like do you want to help me out here kind of like do I familiar to you?

291
0:22:35 --> 0:22:38
There's the regular dance of do I look familiar to it?

292
0:22:39 --> 0:22:44
And she goes you're probably gonna say I look like a singer. I go. Oh well

293
0:22:44 --> 0:22:45
Okay, I you know

294
0:22:45 --> 0:22:49
I work in town, you know

295
0:22:49 --> 0:22:55
Showbiz maybe maybe uh, maybe I think she's cross paths and she goes. Yeah. No, i'm not that singer

296
0:22:55 --> 0:22:57
I'm not even a singer

297
0:22:59 --> 0:22:59
I

298
0:22:59 --> 0:23:01
And then like went away like half annoyed

299
0:23:04 --> 0:23:05
And I

300
0:23:05 --> 0:23:11
What a weirdy and I said like she went away as half of a domino's advertisement from the 80s

301
0:23:12 --> 0:23:15
The person next to me I was like I didn't even bring up the singer part

302
0:23:15 --> 0:23:20
She did I only said yes to the singing part because I thought we were trying to figure out how we knew each other

303
0:23:20 --> 0:23:22
I thought you were helping me out

304
0:23:22 --> 0:23:27
He's like no, you just think every black woman's a singer. Go fuck yourself. You racist is basically what?

305
0:23:27 --> 0:23:30
Happened there. Ah, that's what it was. Yeah

306
0:23:31 --> 0:23:32
So we did not hit it off

307
0:23:32 --> 0:23:38
That was I I one strike on the socializing for the for the uh for the city cast vegas

308
0:23:38 --> 0:23:39
outing there

309
0:23:39 --> 0:23:45
Oh, that's and that is too bad because that is the person that we brought in today to uh interview for this

310
0:23:45 --> 0:23:49
Hello. Hello miss. Uh, you so you you met matt donnelly last night. Did you oh no?

311
0:23:51 --> 0:23:51
Yes

312
0:23:53 --> 0:23:57
And and you did not care for your interaction with matt donnelly

313
0:23:57 --> 0:24:00
Hey, are we actually recording on this? Oh, we're recording right now, buddy

314
0:24:01 --> 0:24:04
Okay, let's do this. I'm here. Am I sounding okay on this?

315
0:24:06 --> 0:24:09
That's rob we're doing it we're in the middle of a bit but rob rob is here

316
0:24:10 --> 0:24:10
um

317
0:24:11 --> 0:24:15
Rob, I was just talking about being at city cast les vegas social gathering last night and we're already rolling

318
0:24:15 --> 0:24:18
I know I could sense the excitement in your voice as you

319
0:24:18 --> 0:24:20
Recall the big event. That's what that was

320
0:24:21 --> 0:24:26
I will say i'm gonna burn you guys right now you guys handed out conversation starters last night

321
0:24:26 --> 0:24:27
To people as they walked in

322
0:24:27 --> 0:24:33
We sure did and I am laughing because I have inside information on your company

323
0:24:33 --> 0:24:40
That you guys are allowed to be a little political but you're not supposed to be like a politically leaning podcast organization, right?

324
0:24:40 --> 0:24:46
Uh, we we get feedback every now and then from upper management as well as the audience

325
0:24:46 --> 0:24:53
What I like to say is city cast is for everyone if you love las vegas or love to trash las vegas either way

326
0:24:53 --> 0:24:58
We have a home for you great officially welcome rob from city cast las vegas. Thank you

327
0:24:59 --> 0:25:04
And uh, hey las vegas newsletter editor and I appear occasionally on the podcast

328
0:25:04 --> 0:25:08
Yeah, just to clarify absolutely you do a great job on both your newsletter is outstanding

329
0:25:08 --> 0:25:10
I think you do an amazing newsletter

330
0:25:10 --> 0:25:16
I think some of my favorite things uh that you guys make the nevada independent and the las vegas review journal

331
0:25:16 --> 0:25:21
Look like you might as well just light dog poop on fire and ring their doorbells. You're embarrassing them

332
0:25:21 --> 0:25:26
You are embarrassing them. Well, we we link to them sometimes so we got we got a tip ahead to them

333
0:25:26 --> 0:25:31
You know, we just kind of like to collect what everyone's talking about add a little bit of our own stew to the mix

334
0:25:31 --> 0:25:37
And or mix to the stew either way, but um, it's we slide into your inbox at 6 a.m

335
0:25:37 --> 0:25:42
Every morning and give you a quick look at what's going on in vegas. So here is the uh,

336
0:25:42 --> 0:25:47
Everyone loves las vegas icebreaker. You guys hated me when I came with a party last night. Okay, great

337
0:25:48 --> 0:25:52
What's should we should we have the conversation based on this card now?

338
0:25:53 --> 0:26:00
This card says what's your ethical responsibility as a citizen when you believe your country is acting immorally. That's your casual

339
0:26:03 --> 0:26:08
Icebreaker for me to just talk to any citizen of las vegas

340
0:26:08 --> 0:26:11
That is a literal few people

341
0:26:11 --> 0:26:13
That's a literal icebreaker

342
0:26:14 --> 0:26:16
They have to switch out today

343
0:26:16 --> 0:26:19
Some did yes, I don't want to talk about those nature

344
0:26:19 --> 0:26:25
Rob this doesn't have to be a god-chosen journalism moment, but this has david figler written all over it. This is figler all over it

345
0:26:26 --> 0:26:30
I think it was more like um, we have what we call a membership team

346
0:26:30 --> 0:26:36
That helps us organize these events because it was for city cast neighbors. That's our our membership group. That's right

347
0:26:36 --> 0:26:39
And uh, you know, we were kind of worried because some of these people, you know

348
0:26:39 --> 0:26:43
They want to get out and about they want to meet new people. So we don't want it to be

349
0:26:43 --> 0:26:45
You know awkward so sometimes, you know

350
0:26:45 --> 0:26:47
We had a couple games out like uno and stuff

351
0:26:47 --> 0:26:53
But nobody even had to open them because everyone was naturally organically making conversation and mingling

352
0:26:53 --> 0:26:58
So it's true the icebreaker card was part of that and I think a few people used it

353
0:26:58 --> 0:27:03
But not everybody did but it's a good way just to welcome people and get them thinking about something straight off the bed

354
0:27:03 --> 0:27:04
it was uh

355
0:27:04 --> 0:27:09
It was a landmine and the people that I met but uh, we moved on anyway

356
0:27:09 --> 0:27:12
So you did get some intel and asked the question to it

357
0:27:12 --> 0:27:17
I did I did fitting off with uh with two doctors, uh last night, uh, daniel and christine, I think

358
0:27:17 --> 0:27:22
Uh, okay last night. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're doctors and uh

359
0:27:22 --> 0:27:26
I'll vouch for them. Yeah. Yeah, and they did it. There's always someone's about there. I just say yes, I mean

360
0:27:26 --> 0:27:32
Uh, if we're not for your newsletter rob, I wouldn't know things like the taco bell ultra run

361
0:27:32 --> 0:27:34
Which is coming up in a couple of weeks here

362
0:27:34 --> 0:27:38
Actually, it's coming up saturday saturday. Oh, it's the saturday. All right

363
0:27:38 --> 0:27:39
It's not too soon

364
0:27:40 --> 0:27:46
It's uh where people run from summerland to henderson and stop by seven taco bells

365
0:27:46 --> 0:27:51
And have to eat a taco bell menu item at each stop. Oh, no

366
0:27:52 --> 0:27:55
You know, I and then run some more

367
0:27:55 --> 0:28:00
One of the things we do at city cast vegas is we do events we compile events and it's kind of like a guide

368
0:28:00 --> 0:28:05
To the week and I was coming across this thing called the taco bell ultra marathon

369
0:28:05 --> 0:28:09
I'm like that looks boring some another marathon sponsored by some

370
0:28:09 --> 0:28:14
Corporate entity and then I looked at it and this isn't sponsored by anybody at all. This isn't official

371
0:28:14 --> 0:28:18
It's a grassroots thing that um

372
0:28:18 --> 0:28:24
A person came up with who was in an organization here locally called. I believe the las vegas slow runners

373
0:28:25 --> 0:28:29
so, you know, there are people who want to be out and about but it's kind of like all skills and

374
0:28:30 --> 0:28:32
Uh all skill levels welcome

375
0:28:32 --> 0:28:35
And the whole idea is you start at a taco bell

376
0:28:35 --> 0:28:41
In summerland you end up at a taco bell in henderson and you stop at five others along the way

377
0:28:41 --> 0:28:45
This is more than 30 miles. This is why I didn't feel this was a real event

378
0:28:45 --> 0:28:51
I'm like, yeah like this is a joke for people who don't know henderson and summerland are on opposite sides of the city

379
0:28:51 --> 0:28:56
Of las vegas they they are they are two just neighborhoods basically on the east and west sides of the city

380
0:28:56 --> 0:29:00
It's not even easy to run between the two takes a while. Yes

381
0:29:00 --> 0:29:07
Oh driving between the two is a nightmare running between the two full of taco bell seems like a hellscape

382
0:29:07 --> 0:29:13
Right. So there's there's some guide guidelines and even experienced runners. I did talk to someone involved

383
0:29:13 --> 0:29:17
So I knew this was legit and they're like, you know, i'm a runner myself

384
0:29:17 --> 0:29:22
This will probably take me like eight hours. Some people may be five some people may be longer

385
0:29:22 --> 0:29:26
But also I think some of the participants might just do like two or three taco bells

386
0:29:26 --> 0:29:30
I think the real serious ones are the ones who are like doing the whole thing

387
0:29:30 --> 0:29:34
I'm a taco bell 5k guy. I'm not a taco bell seven taco bell running guy

388
0:29:34 --> 0:29:37
I can I think run from one to the other and then call it a day

389
0:29:37 --> 0:29:44
But you have to eat something different at each taco bell. You can't repeat and then you have to eat the whole menu item

390
0:29:44 --> 0:29:47
Yes, and you can't run with it. You have to finish it and then go

391
0:29:47 --> 0:29:51
You can't just eat like a bite of a taco and then head out. You got to eat the whole taco

392
0:29:52 --> 0:29:57
Exactly, and um, also there's a 15 minute penalty added to your time if you throw up

393
0:29:58 --> 0:29:59
Wow

394
0:30:00 --> 0:30:01
This is a real rule

395
0:30:01 --> 0:30:04
That's fine. There is a 15 minute in this race

396
0:30:04 --> 0:30:09
There is a 15 minute penalty for that in life. There is a much bigger penalty for it if you don't throw up though

397
0:30:10 --> 0:30:10
No

398
0:30:11 --> 0:30:13
If it wants to come out let it come out

399
0:30:13 --> 0:30:15
Please do

400
0:30:15 --> 0:30:16
Hi

401
0:30:16 --> 0:30:19
And again just to let you guys know city cast is legit

402
0:30:19 --> 0:30:24
I reached out to the slow runners and the person's person's personal

403
0:30:24 --> 0:30:28
Instagram page trying to get them on today's podcast and could not reach them

404
0:30:28 --> 0:30:31
But you got you got the interview you got that you got the facts

405
0:30:31 --> 0:30:36
Uh there. Yeah, so I ended up talking to someone who's actually making the official t-shirts

406
0:30:36 --> 0:30:42
So if you go on their website, they have an official t-shirt for this unofficial taco bell event. Holy smokes

407
0:30:42 --> 0:30:46
Um, one of the taco bells is right on the corner from my house

408
0:30:46 --> 0:30:50
You should just go and hang. I know I was like maybe just go cheer them on one of those tables with like cups

409
0:30:50 --> 0:30:57
Of water maybe there was water. That'd be a bucket ready for anyone who's ready to uh, you wouldn't bring wire 15 minutes

410
0:30:57 --> 0:31:00
You have 15 minute penalty buckets waiting for them

411
0:31:01 --> 0:31:04
Little cups of baja blast. That's what you gotta have ready

412
0:31:04 --> 0:31:07
There's a baja blast bonus

413
0:31:07 --> 0:31:09
Um, you can there's two bonuses

414
0:31:09 --> 0:31:14
One is you can add diablo sauce to everything and do a diablo sauce shooter at the end

415
0:31:14 --> 0:31:16
I think it's just drinking a packet fine fine

416
0:31:16 --> 0:31:22
And the second one is you have to commit to drinking at least two liters of baja blast

417
0:31:22 --> 0:31:25
Along the way over the seven locations

418
0:31:26 --> 0:31:30
So what's that equate to like four larges or something like that?

419
0:31:31 --> 0:31:33
It's about two liters. It's about half a dozen

420
0:31:34 --> 0:31:40
Vomits six. I think is what this was invented by someone who loves taco bell and hates running. There's no there's no, you know what this actually

421
0:31:41 --> 0:31:46
Happened in a couple other cities. Um, apparently this is an annual tradition in denver

422
0:31:46 --> 0:31:49
I think they're the first ones to come up with it and just a few weeks ago

423
0:31:49 --> 0:31:56
There was one in the dc area and just by coincidence the ceo of city cast david plotz

424
0:31:57 --> 0:32:01
He saw my story sent me a note and said his son ran in the dc version

425
0:32:01 --> 0:32:03
And completed it was in october

426
0:32:04 --> 0:32:06
I believe it was late november

427
0:32:06 --> 0:32:07
Okay

428
0:32:07 --> 0:32:08
Okay, great

429
0:32:08 --> 0:32:15
Maybe denver was october maybe I don't know the website I found says uh 50 kilometers nine taco bell meals

430
0:32:15 --> 0:32:20
Across dc. Whoa. Yeah, it's insane even worse than the uh, this one

431
0:32:21 --> 0:32:23
Yeah, oh man

432
0:32:24 --> 0:32:28
Uh 31.07 miles while stopping at nine taco bells

433
0:32:31 --> 0:32:34
There's not a single part of that that makes me want to do that

434
0:32:36 --> 0:32:42
And the idea is you wear costumes and kind of have fun with it sure and it's all a truss system, right? Yeah

435
0:32:42 --> 0:32:45
And you win a golden taco at the end if you're first, oh

436
0:32:46 --> 0:32:52
Oh, come on burying the league being a golden taco winner is pretty great

437
0:32:53 --> 0:32:54
Yeah, great

438
0:32:54 --> 0:33:00
I don't know what it is that goes that goes right on the intro to everything I do after that, you know

439
0:33:00 --> 0:33:01
No matter what i'm doing

440
0:33:01 --> 0:33:07
That should be um front page in the rj golden taco winner is yeah

441
0:33:07 --> 0:33:07
Yeah

442
0:33:09 --> 0:33:14
All right, and I don't know what it is I asked my contact who is part of this

443
0:33:14 --> 0:33:18
Um who's making the shirts and I said what is a golden taco and she said I don't know

444
0:33:19 --> 0:33:22
So it's a little bit of a surprise for whoever gets it. All right

445
0:33:23 --> 0:33:28
Uh rob I gave you uh, I gave you 12 hours. I gave you 12 hours notice on the spot

446
0:33:28 --> 0:33:31
To do a year-end round-up hours of sleep

447
0:33:31 --> 0:33:32
Yeah, yeah, exactly

448
0:33:33 --> 0:33:39
And he does last night I challenged you to come on here and I wanted uh, the top three

449
0:33:39 --> 0:33:42
under-reported vega stories for 2025

450
0:33:42 --> 0:33:47
Yes, now when I asked you that the idea is popping your head right away or did you was it hard to come up with?

451
0:33:48 --> 0:33:53
Uh, no, because you also gave me um the option for uh, the five overall news stories of the year

452
0:33:53 --> 0:33:57
And I said well three sounds easier than five. So let's talk about that

453
0:34:01 --> 0:34:05
And I think my first option will make you groan. You'll be like you didn't put much into this

454
0:34:05 --> 0:34:07
But I want us to think about

455
0:34:07 --> 0:34:10
I want I want us to think about the uh the year

456
0:34:11 --> 0:34:15
So far looking back. It's been a it's one of those years. It kind of feels like

457
0:34:15 --> 0:34:19
Two years. It doesn't really feel like all this was one year lots been going on

458
0:34:20 --> 0:34:27
But what do we remember as the first do you guys remember what the first big news story of the year is?

459
0:34:27 --> 0:34:29
From okay January of 2025

460
0:34:31 --> 0:34:31
Yes

461
0:34:33 --> 0:34:34
No, no

462
0:34:34 --> 0:34:37
I don't remember what the first new story of december. I guess this election shit

463
0:34:38 --> 0:34:42
Are we talking just vegas? Uh, maybe somewhat indirectly

464
0:34:42 --> 0:34:44
Just vegas, right?

465
0:34:45 --> 0:34:46
Just vegas. Yes. Yeah, i'm thinking

466
0:34:46 --> 0:34:53
From now i'm on the outside in pa now getting still I still have lots of feeds coming up

467
0:34:53 --> 0:34:58
My first thought goes to the boring company increasing their uh

468
0:34:58 --> 0:34:59
presence

469
0:34:59 --> 0:35:01
They uh, elon musk tunnel company. Yeah

470
0:35:02 --> 0:35:05
Okay, any any other um guesses

471
0:35:05 --> 0:35:08
I guess there was a bunch of protests stage in january, right?

472
0:35:08 --> 0:35:12
And we we have a bad we have a bad record with how we handle protests. Are we are we there?

473
0:35:12 --> 0:35:16
There's always a protest about something every day this story i'm going to give you a hint. Okay was

474
0:35:17 --> 0:35:18
explosive

475
0:35:21 --> 0:35:26
Explosive explosive news story. Oh was this the uh, the the tesla truck that blew up at trump's tower

476
0:35:27 --> 0:35:30
That's right. It happened people forget this it happened on january 1st

477
0:35:30 --> 0:35:33
Oh my god, 2025 new year's day

478
0:35:33 --> 0:35:34
Yeah, yeah

479
0:35:34 --> 0:35:34
Yeah

480
0:35:34 --> 0:35:36
This was the tesla cyber truck that the guy blew up

481
0:35:36 --> 0:35:41
Like in the valet parking area of the of the trump tower here in vegas and he was in it, right?

482
0:35:42 --> 0:35:42
Yeah

483
0:35:45 --> 0:35:45
he um

484
0:35:45 --> 0:35:50
Blew up along with the tesla. Um, he drove to be clear. He wasn't he didn't blow it up by accident

485
0:35:50 --> 0:35:55
He meant to blow it up. Yes. Yeah, this was an act of terrorism. This was an attack. Yeah

486
0:35:55 --> 0:35:58
Yeah, it wasn't like, you know the accelerator like right, you know

487
0:35:58 --> 0:35:59
Had a mishap

488
0:36:01 --> 0:36:08
I don't think they have those in teslas. Anyway, but um, yeah, so this guy drove from colorado springs rented the tesla

489
0:36:09 --> 0:36:13
And you know, he came pulled up. I think i'm learning right now that it was a rental

490
0:36:13 --> 0:36:20
I think i'm learning that right now facts. This is what you get from city cast. That's right details

491
0:36:20 --> 0:36:22
Yeah, I mean you're not gonna blow up your own tesla

492
0:36:22 --> 0:36:26
And you know replacing the batteries

493
0:36:27 --> 0:36:28
So if you do survive

494
0:36:29 --> 0:36:35
You know you want to yeah, that explains why somebody else's car my my rates at budget and hurts went up last year

495
0:36:35 --> 0:36:40
That explains it. I think this had something to do with it. Yes, he used toro. Do you know what toro?

496
0:36:40 --> 0:36:43
Oh, yes, you are. Oh, it's sort of like um

497
0:36:44 --> 0:36:48
And I know it's kind of like almost we thought about getting into this when it was brand new

498
0:36:48 --> 0:36:50
It's the uber of rentals. I think yeah

499
0:36:50 --> 0:36:52
You can like sort of like air b and b in your car, right?

500
0:36:52 --> 0:36:58
Yeah, that's car sharing that actually does make it more fucked up because everyone running a toro usually owns like one or two cars

501
0:36:58 --> 0:37:01
For toro, you know, it's basically like how we all can run our own rental car company

502
0:37:01 --> 0:37:05
So that means that people used to do this with the condos. Yeah

503
0:37:05 --> 0:37:10
So this means that person really did blow up someone else's like really that was a really expensive hundred thousand dollar

504
0:37:11 --> 0:37:15
Tesla cyber truck. It's kind of it's kind of like an extra fu, you know

505
0:37:15 --> 0:37:17
I'm gonna ruin this guy's car

506
0:37:17 --> 0:37:21
But yeah pulled up to the portico chair the valet and you know

507
0:37:21 --> 0:37:26
What I think is kind of under reported about this story is yeah got a lot of attention at the time

508
0:37:26 --> 0:37:27
but you know when

509
0:37:27 --> 0:37:32
The person responsible dies, you know, you don't really get to follow up on motives

510
0:37:32 --> 0:37:35
You don't really get to follow up on you know, what was behind this, right?

511
0:37:35 --> 0:37:41
And you know, there was sort of I mean the guy had a history in the special forces with the u.s army

512
0:37:41 --> 0:37:45
And you know, there were sort of like questions over his political leanings

513
0:37:45 --> 0:37:48
And if that had something to do with it or if he's just having

514
0:37:49 --> 0:37:54
You know a bad time in life and is coping with this and maybe had some mental health issues

515
0:37:54 --> 0:37:59
Sure, but the fact that you know, this is happening at the trump tower

516
0:38:00 --> 0:38:00
which

517
0:38:00 --> 0:38:04
You know coming right after a very contentious election

518
0:38:05 --> 0:38:06
and um

519
0:38:06 --> 0:38:09
The trump presidency was there some drama around that. I I missed that

520
0:38:09 --> 0:38:12
Yeah, you may have heard. Um the host was president again

521
0:38:12 --> 0:38:16
So I have not been following the news closely

522
0:38:16 --> 0:38:18
yeah, so um

523
0:38:18 --> 0:38:18
You know

524
0:38:18 --> 0:38:25
But it also makes you think about how easily it is for kind of what could be considered an act of terrorism to take place

525
0:38:25 --> 0:38:29
At a las vegas landmark, right? I mean pull up into a valet

526
0:38:29 --> 0:38:30
So you kind of wonder about okay

527
0:38:30 --> 0:38:36
What's happening since then to account for this kind of stuff to catch people before they take this kind of action?

528
0:38:36 --> 0:38:38
And how do you increase security?

529
0:38:39 --> 0:38:43
Remember there was that crash that happened in front of planet hollywood a few years back

530
0:38:43 --> 0:38:49
Yep, and and now because of that because they ran into tourists walking on the sidewalk now you have the

531
0:38:49 --> 0:38:52
You know the pillars the ballasts, I believe

532
0:38:52 --> 0:38:52
Yeah

533
0:38:52 --> 0:38:57
They're concrete ballasts that are along the along the sidewalk blocking off the the sidewalks from the road now

534
0:38:57 --> 0:39:03
Because the crash you're referring to is open. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're they're everywhere now and they and they came up quick

535
0:39:04 --> 0:39:06
They grew out of the sidewalks

536
0:39:06 --> 0:39:09
Right, we gave birth and planted the seed and

537
0:39:10 --> 0:39:13
That's the company I should have started the ballast company. I would have made a fortune

538
0:39:14 --> 0:39:20
Yeah, I think especially in this town. So I mean vegas is always looking at ways to improve security

539
0:39:20 --> 0:39:25
The chat is yelling at us bollards. Yeah bollards not ballast ballast is at the bottom of a boat bollards

540
0:39:25 --> 0:39:29
Are the things on the side of the road? Yeah, it's not like my business's words or anything

541
0:39:32 --> 0:39:35
We'll edit this in post these microphones are decorative. Yeah

542
0:39:36 --> 0:39:41
So I thought that's a somewhat under-reported story mainly because it's been forgotten

543
0:39:41 --> 0:39:46
Yeah, you're right. I totally haven't thought about that forever and it happened in my own backyard

544
0:39:47 --> 0:39:47
and

545
0:39:48 --> 0:39:51
I didn't connect it to all of the bollards that are around

546
0:39:52 --> 0:39:54
Here or ballasts

547
0:39:55 --> 0:40:02
Or ballads for the people standing in front of buildings singing to make sure you don't crash your car. They just sing beautiful slow songs

548
0:40:03 --> 0:40:06
Matt she's not that singer. I don't know who you think

549
0:40:06 --> 0:40:13
So I have a second story that the second story kind of uh follows a similar theme

550
0:40:13 --> 0:40:17
we're gonna kind of go and and flow between one story and another but um

551
0:40:18 --> 0:40:21
Have you noticed anything about metro police this year?

552
0:40:22 --> 0:40:27
I mean, they're super nice and polite and don't give out a bunch of fuck you tickets

553
0:40:27 --> 0:40:29
Oh wait, no, i'm wrong

554
0:40:29 --> 0:40:35
Uh, they've handled uh, I think they've handled the arrest of some of our friends very well

555
0:40:36 --> 0:40:41
Do you know people have you had to bail out people? No, we're good friends with jimmy. Uh, sonina who had that terrible, uh,

556
0:40:42 --> 0:40:45
Uh, there you have protest. Yeah, you got arrested for some nonsense

557
0:40:45 --> 0:40:50
Yeah, right. Um, so, you know the one thing i've noticed about metro this year

558
0:40:50 --> 0:40:55
Which has gotten some attention, but I think it needs to get a little more attention. Okay, the way this fleet

559
0:40:55 --> 0:40:56
is expanding

560
0:40:56 --> 0:41:00
Um, just the technology they're using, um

561
0:41:01 --> 0:41:08
I think you may have seen the hoopla over their big cyber truck speaking of which cyber truck patrol fleet

562
0:41:08 --> 0:41:11
Yeah, some guy gave them a bunch of cyber trucks

563
0:41:11 --> 0:41:14
Yeah, and how much do you think those fleet of cyber trucks cost?

564
0:41:15 --> 0:41:16
Oh

565
0:41:16 --> 0:41:21
Oh gosh, I i bet with the retrofitting and stuff that they're doing to the cyber trucks

566
0:41:21 --> 0:41:26
They've got to be two hundred thousand dollars a piece, right? They got to have bulletproof, uh stuff in them

567
0:41:26 --> 0:41:28
I kind of 200 000

568
0:41:29 --> 0:41:31
Elon musk tried to

569
0:41:32 --> 0:41:35
Speaking of things that we forgot about remember when elon musk, uh

570
0:41:35 --> 0:41:42
Debuted the cyber trucks and threw a big steel ball bearing at the back windows to show off the bulletproof glass

571
0:41:42 --> 0:41:46
And it wasn't bulletproof glass. So he just broke them on stage at the unveiling. I do remember that they just went

572
0:41:46 --> 0:41:47
Oh, well, yeah

573
0:41:47 --> 0:41:52
They were like oops and then they did it again on a different window. That one also wasn't bulletproof

574
0:41:53 --> 0:41:57
So he just broke two different windows give us 10 of those yeah, that's the ones for us

575
0:41:57 --> 0:42:01
So some guy bought a bunch of tesla cyber trucks for for las vegas metro police

576
0:42:01 --> 0:42:04
Uh, like right so like 10 or 15 of them

577
0:42:04 --> 0:42:09
This was nearly three million dollar donation from a tech investor

578
0:42:09 --> 0:42:12
uh ben horowitz who is

579
0:42:12 --> 0:42:17
With a venture capital firm, uh andersen horowitz. Oh, so good guy. Okay, and

580
0:42:18 --> 0:42:22
Yeah, but this isn't the first time he's donated to uh metro

581
0:42:23 --> 0:42:26
Do you uh, do you remember the other?

582
0:42:26 --> 0:42:32
Forgotten story this year of remember the guy who set tesla cars on fire at the at the dealership

583
0:42:33 --> 0:42:39
Yes, yes, which was like a protest right and he was caught but metro said, you know

584
0:42:39 --> 0:42:42
We wouldn't have caught him without some of this new technology

585
0:42:42 --> 0:42:47
We have specifically license plate readers that are now throughout the city

586
0:42:47 --> 0:42:50
And there's a there's about 180 of them

587
0:42:50 --> 0:42:57
At least at the time that we did the story and those cost about six million and who do you think paid for those?

588
0:42:57 --> 0:42:58
This guy horowitz

589
0:42:59 --> 0:43:01
Yeah, oh wow

590
0:43:01 --> 0:43:04
So this guy not get a lot of speeding tickets. What's going on with this?

591
0:43:04 --> 0:43:08
Mr. Horowitz person. Well now correct me if i'm wrong rob

592
0:43:08 --> 0:43:13
But are not the very legality of those devices still in contention?

593
0:43:14 --> 0:43:14
Um

594
0:43:15 --> 0:43:19
You I mean you can definitely make from a privacy standpoint. This is a privacy violation

595
0:43:19 --> 0:43:25
I mean, do you want to be tracked? You know your whereabouts going because that's how they work answer. No

596
0:43:25 --> 0:43:28
Okay, that that's the question answer interesting. Yeah

597
0:43:29 --> 0:43:31
but the way they sort of get around this is

598
0:43:31 --> 0:43:39
I believe they make the donation to um, sort of like a third party like fraternal order of police type of thing

599
0:43:39 --> 0:43:41
And then it kind of goes through that way

600
0:43:41 --> 0:43:45
You know if this guy was really in some kind of legal trouble

601
0:43:45 --> 0:43:50
What would happen right when you're donating millions and millions to make um

602
0:43:50 --> 0:43:53
you know metro police, um

603
0:43:53 --> 0:43:57
In theory more successful more like a uh an army unit

604
0:43:57 --> 0:44:02
But um, you know what happens if you commit some major felony, you know commit

605
0:44:02 --> 0:44:04
I'm not saying this guy's a bad guy at all. Maybe he's a great guy

606
0:44:04 --> 0:44:10
But you know, it works in some protection. It is weird, you know makes you it makes you pause. Yeah

607
0:44:10 --> 0:44:13
is there any other

608
0:44:13 --> 0:44:16
Motive like in other words like just just just spitballing

609
0:44:16 --> 0:44:22
I mean like like why would a guy spend over 10 million dollars to quote-unquote make the city safer?

610
0:44:22 --> 0:44:24
But basically to give tesla trucks and surveillance equipment

611
0:44:24 --> 0:44:26
to one city

612
0:44:27 --> 0:44:34
Uh, like what what's it? I don't understand anytime there's a side collection for him anytime. There's a data collection element

613
0:44:35 --> 0:44:39
That can be monetized. So he's not doing this out of the goodness of his heart

614
0:44:39 --> 0:44:43
There is money to be made with that license plate data. That's what i'm asking right?

615
0:44:43 --> 0:44:48
I don't know exactly. I don't know exactly what or is it even probably you could probably

616
0:44:48 --> 0:44:52
Here's what you can probably figure out a way to measure like cars

617
0:44:53 --> 0:44:56
um mileage and all that kind of thing there their mph

618
0:44:56 --> 0:45:00
Or mpg, uh, you know ratings and things like that

619
0:45:00 --> 0:45:03
What does the acidity of your armpits have to do with anything paul? I don't know

620
0:45:03 --> 0:45:07
It always has something to do with it balance for a man, but made for a lady

621
0:45:08 --> 0:45:08
Uh

622
0:45:09 --> 0:45:16
No, it's all it's all crazy. I I saw a tiktok recently where someone was talking about this very thing and

623
0:45:16 --> 0:45:20
It's not about the billionaires accumulating all this wealth at the end of the day

624
0:45:20 --> 0:45:23
Yes, that's kind of a sickness and a weird symptom of it all

625
0:45:23 --> 0:45:31
But the accumulation of the wealth is secondary to their end goal, which is becoming above the rules of normal society

626
0:45:31 --> 0:45:35
Right and how better to become above the rules of normal society

627
0:45:35 --> 0:45:38
Than by purchasing the people who enforce the rules of normal society

628
0:45:39 --> 0:45:44
I mean this literally is like like batman comic villain level. It is

629
0:45:44 --> 0:45:48
Right frightening where you're like, oh, I I just did a google search on this guy

630
0:45:48 --> 0:45:53
Uh, apparently he's opening a new nightclub in las vegas. It's called horowitz island

631
0:45:54 --> 0:45:54
island

632
0:45:55 --> 0:45:58
Uh, and apparently the police are just not paying any attention to it at all

633
0:45:58 --> 0:45:59
Okay, good good good

634
0:46:00 --> 0:46:05
The big the big the big uh innovation of the nightclub is that you you don't get carted at the door

635
0:46:05 --> 0:46:07
That's right

636
0:46:08 --> 0:46:12
They've got technology that allows you to not be carted at the door. It's basically a teen club

637
0:46:13 --> 0:46:14
It sure is

638
0:46:14 --> 0:46:17
I don't know the teens seem awfully old to be hanging out there

639
0:46:20 --> 0:46:20
Allegedly

640
0:46:22 --> 0:46:24
I'm sure is a great guy

641
0:46:24 --> 0:46:28
But it's not just cyber trucks. It's not just uh the license plate readers

642
0:46:28 --> 0:46:32
There's also a fleet of drones now. Oh, no, that's uh, mr

643
0:46:32 --> 0:46:38
Horowitz says the drones kill me well the the the city owned one day maybe yeah. Yeah, it's true

644
0:46:39 --> 0:46:41
That that's such a weird thing

645
0:46:42 --> 0:46:46
Oh, and if you look at it, you know, if you just kind of

646
0:46:46 --> 0:46:49
Who's our governor right now joe lombardo?

647
0:46:49 --> 0:46:54
Yeah, the old sheriff and what did he used to be so I mean chief of police getting your influence

648
0:46:54 --> 0:47:00
Um where you can you know, it could be very valuable depending where people end up in public office. Yeah

649
0:47:02 --> 0:47:06
I but that you're right. This is next level bizarreness. I had no idea

650
0:47:06 --> 0:47:13
It was just one person footing the bill in a donation role to create this kind of militaristic

651
0:47:13 --> 0:47:15
approach to policing

652
0:47:16 --> 0:47:24
Is the are the cops at least flexing on safety? Are they flexing on any kind of statistics to back up any of this?

653
0:47:24 --> 0:47:29
Uh cause i'd be more afraid they're flexing on people he or if it's doesn't like

654
0:47:31 --> 0:47:34
Right well the sheriff right now is um

655
0:47:34 --> 0:47:39
Um, you know running for reelection. He's saying uh murders are down I believe but these are all stats

656
0:47:39 --> 0:47:45
You can count them how you like but you know, what happens if there's a greater for example ice presence in las vegas

657
0:47:46 --> 0:47:48
And we are experiencing right now

658
0:47:48 --> 0:47:52
Right and um, but it could get really bad in theory like some other cities

659
0:47:52 --> 0:47:59
And what happens when the governor gets involved or the sheriff gets involved and now you start mixing politics with uh influence

660
0:48:00 --> 0:48:01
and how

661
0:48:01 --> 0:48:07
Much to resist this kind of stuff or get involved in it. It just raises a lot of questions and hypotheticals

662
0:48:07 --> 0:48:12
It's not great. It's not it's not a good look. It's it's the um, what's what's the uh,

663
0:48:12 --> 0:48:16
The thing you wanted you you want to avoid the uh, the appearance of impropriety

664
0:48:16 --> 0:48:21
And this this certainly does not avoid that appearance. That's what i'm trying to whether there is that's what i'm whether there is any

665
0:48:21 --> 0:48:27
Propriety or not this looks shady as fuck. That's what i'm poking that jacob is like, of course hearing this you make you go

666
0:48:27 --> 0:48:28
Like yikes, right?

667
0:48:28 --> 0:48:32
but like our what is the counter and that's I mean that's what's actually i've been fascinated by

668
0:48:32 --> 0:48:38
A lot of these terrible things that are happening in the country is that that doesn't even seem to be

669
0:48:38 --> 0:48:43
A quote unquote company line that people are hiding under anymore people just say like, yep. It's terrible

670
0:48:43 --> 0:48:46
We love it. We love terrible shit happening. It's awesome

671
0:48:46 --> 0:48:50
Like I don't I don't if you're not doing anything wrong. You shouldn't be worried about it

672
0:48:52 --> 0:48:58
Um, so yeah, this guy is someone in chat saying that he invests in in in in in flock safety

673
0:48:59 --> 0:49:03
I guess that's the company that tracks license plates. That's the license plate. Gotcha

674
0:49:03 --> 0:49:05
so the racer slash reader slash

675
0:49:05 --> 0:49:08
So he is he's getting data to

676
0:49:08 --> 0:49:09
sell

677
0:49:09 --> 0:49:13
This that's it. Yeah, it seems like it we get we get to be his demo city

678
0:49:13 --> 0:49:18
Although in vegas, we're so many cars without a license plate. You're gonna lose a chunk of data

679
0:49:18 --> 0:49:21
We just stepped up a thing about to call people out on that

680
0:49:21 --> 0:49:25
But now we've got neighbors reporting on each other on that. So that's fine

681
0:49:25 --> 0:49:31
Tattletale line is what rob is the one who reported that let me know that was working there. The tattletale line is working

682
0:49:31 --> 0:49:38
Have you ever been working working? I don't know. It's generating more tax revenue for the state. It's scary

683
0:49:38 --> 0:49:40
Rob, that's what I want city cast to crack

684
0:49:40 --> 0:49:47
I want you to do either an article or a podcast with just tattletalers what they get out of it why they're doing it

685
0:49:48 --> 0:49:54
Like who have you have you encountered anyone who's called in anyone on that line like like a

686
0:49:54 --> 0:49:56
guide on how to narc

687
0:49:57 --> 0:50:01
Yeah, like no. No, I want to hear from the narcs. I want to hear from the well

688
0:50:01 --> 0:50:06
Well, my favorite narc is that you can report on people who have smog issues with their car

689
0:50:08 --> 0:50:12
There's an actual program matt what's your license plate up

690
0:50:13 --> 0:50:15
Leave my carola smog out of this

691
0:50:15 --> 0:50:22
Well, you can't tell me those guys working in the smog shacks aren't just as soon as somebody fails and heads off on their day

692
0:50:22 --> 0:50:26
They're not jumping on the horn and they oh, yeah, I got a tip

693
0:50:27 --> 0:50:31
I don't think they get like a cash reward for oh, well, then maybe they're not doing it like

694
0:50:32 --> 0:50:37
Making life hard for your neighbor. It was like aluminum cans like you get 10 cents. It's like a

695
0:50:39 --> 0:50:40
Golden taco

696
0:50:43 --> 0:50:44
Um

697
0:50:44 --> 0:50:48
So I guess we're just at the beginning of what this means rob, right?

698
0:50:48 --> 0:50:54
We don't know what this actually is going to entail. Uh, we we haven't seen police drones in action yet. Have we

699
0:50:55 --> 0:51:00
Um, I think they're more of like a glorified delivery service right now where they are at different stations

700
0:51:00 --> 0:51:06
And then they can kind of go and maybe scope out an area before the actual officers arrive

701
0:51:06 --> 0:51:10
Oh, well, I that's kind of a monitoring thing. All right

702
0:51:10 --> 0:51:15
That uh, I I just picture I believe three four of them coming up to me while i'm on my walk at night

703
0:51:15 --> 0:51:17
Just shooting lasers at me is what i'm picturing

704
0:51:18 --> 0:51:19
Well, that's coming next

705
0:51:20 --> 0:51:26
To be unveiled at ces and I mean truly if you're making uh drones for metro services

706
0:51:26 --> 0:51:33
The way you're going to sell more of those drones is to have the predator style three laser dots that you can project on people

707
0:51:33 --> 0:51:35
While they're on their late night walks

708
0:51:36 --> 0:51:41
Yes, the sign of you will sell a fuck ton of those drones to all of these police departments

709
0:51:41 --> 0:51:44
If you just put those three lasers on it. Yeah

710
0:51:45 --> 0:51:47
Um, was that all three was that was that two?

711
0:51:48 --> 0:51:49
Uh, that was two

712
0:51:49 --> 0:51:52
I know they kind of run together and probably feel like one big story

713
0:51:52 --> 0:51:58
But let's go with what we all want to talk about elon musk tesla tunnels boring company

714
0:51:59 --> 0:52:02
We've talked about it a lot at city cast in some way. It's kind of our lane

715
0:52:02 --> 0:52:05
But we've teamed up with pro publica twice now

716
0:52:05 --> 0:52:12
And i'll tell you pro public pro publica does not mess around they are very serious and diligent about what they do

717
0:52:12 --> 0:52:15
A big shout out to david figler our host

718
0:52:15 --> 0:52:18
And lawyer not our lawyer but a lawyer

719
0:52:18 --> 0:52:24
Who really is curious about this stuff really digs deep into it and finds the things that not a lot of other people

720
0:52:24 --> 0:52:28
Find out about so well, you are right. This is definitely under reported

721
0:52:28 --> 0:52:31
I don't think people are talking about this at all on a national level

722
0:52:31 --> 0:52:36
And this company is running amok like a bad

723
0:52:36 --> 0:52:42
Like action tv show where someone has no regard for the law and just keeps ignoring. Oh, it's fine

724
0:52:42 --> 0:52:47
It's really like yeah commit violations now deal with it later

725
0:52:47 --> 0:52:50
They've had warnings. They've had um

726
0:52:51 --> 0:52:54
But in the latest, I mean we reported I believe it was like over a thousand

727
0:52:54 --> 0:53:00
Since they started and then um, or excuse me over a hundred thousand dollars in fines

728
0:53:00 --> 0:53:07
From uh, nevada osha for some safety violations, right and that was last year

729
0:53:07 --> 0:53:11
um this year we were reporting that um

730
0:53:12 --> 0:53:17
Trying to think of what it well it did illegal dumping was one of them they were they were yes

731
0:53:18 --> 0:53:20
kind of by where um

732
0:53:20 --> 0:53:23
Historic commercial center is I was put historic in front of it

733
0:53:24 --> 0:53:29
That's a very kind way to um, you know branding I spent so many years in that spot

734
0:53:29 --> 0:53:35
In historic commercial center. Yes. Yes in the historic onyx theater. Yeah

735
0:53:36 --> 0:53:39
The historic, uh

736
0:53:39 --> 0:53:42
Hawks syringe syringe syringe is historic

737
0:53:42 --> 0:53:44
historic green door

738
0:53:49 --> 0:53:51
History is made at hawks gym

739
0:53:52 --> 0:53:56
But uh hawks gym you can have that to be your new slogan by the way

740
0:53:56 --> 0:53:58
You'd have that for free history is made at hawks gym

741
0:53:58 --> 0:54:04
I mean it is historic and how many clothing optional all-male 24-hour gyms are there in this country?

742
0:54:06 --> 0:54:07
Not enough

743
0:54:10 --> 0:54:13
But i'm sorry, let's stay focused here rob

744
0:54:14 --> 0:54:16
Let's stay let's stay underground with these tests

745
0:54:17 --> 0:54:19
So, um now we reported there was um

746
0:54:20 --> 0:54:26
Almost 800 environmental regulations over the last two years alone and these were sort of for like, um

747
0:54:26 --> 0:54:31
Um digging without approval and releasing untreated water

748
0:54:31 --> 0:54:35
Into like city streets which go back into our water system, right?

749
0:54:36 --> 0:54:42
And there was a case where but you mean like untreated, uh waste water from their machines and things like that

750
0:54:42 --> 0:54:47
Like right water water that they've been using not just water that they found underground somewhere and they're dumping it like

751
0:54:47 --> 0:54:51
It's not like they just found a pocket of water like they're they're

752
0:54:51 --> 0:54:53
Bringing all this this water in

753
0:54:54 --> 0:54:57
Diluting chemicals and yeah, they're doing all this stuff with and they're just dumping it in the street

754
0:54:57 --> 0:55:00
Right and you do go underground you come across water and that kind of thing

755
0:55:00 --> 0:55:06
But you know, there's also waste from just use right and um, you know, they just seem to be

756
0:55:06 --> 0:55:13
Drilling full speed ahead and worrying about um the repercussions later. Um, there's some questions about transparency

757
0:55:13 --> 0:55:21
We had a congresswoman dina titus on our podcast at city cast and she said she wants to see

758
0:55:21 --> 0:55:26
Governor lombardo just open up the transparency of the meetings that are taking place

759
0:55:26 --> 0:55:35
With state officials and the boring company because they're sort of allegations that they're kind of getting some preferential treatment as far as you know

760
0:55:35 --> 0:55:42
Covering this stuff up and not being so transparent about it and kind of giving them some more chances than another company might get

761
0:55:43 --> 0:55:49
But um, you know, there's been agreements there's been allegations of the agreements being broken and just fines left and right

762
0:55:49 --> 0:55:54
But this is a company that has a lot of money at their disposal elon musk is on pace

763
0:55:54 --> 0:55:57
If not already to become the world's first trillionaire. He has money to burn

764
0:55:57 --> 0:55:59
and definitely nicer guy

765
0:56:00 --> 0:56:01
right and

766
0:56:02 --> 0:56:08
This all is for something that um, I know your insider intel said we shouldn't be as

767
0:56:09 --> 0:56:16
Impinionated but I think the boring company the boring tunnel and the boring company and what they're doing under vegas is an incredibly stupid

768
0:56:16 --> 0:56:20
Public transportation. Yes. Yes. The end goal is not

769
0:56:21 --> 0:56:23
It doesn't justify the means at all

770
0:56:23 --> 0:56:29
Like who cares taking traffic above ground and putting it underground the same exact tunnels

771
0:56:29 --> 0:56:33
Could have been a subway or some kind of large scale people mover

772
0:56:33 --> 0:56:35
um why

773
0:56:35 --> 0:56:43
In the name of technology we're just putting taxis underground putting disneyland style conveyor belts underground

774
0:56:43 --> 0:56:48
Where people could just walk down there and then stand on the conveyor belt would have made more sense than this

775
0:56:48 --> 0:56:52
I would have taken that over this. Um, yes, you know just by the way

776
0:56:52 --> 0:56:57
I'll still take that over this if somebody has the conveyor belt technology that they want to put in those tunnels today

777
0:56:57 --> 0:57:01
I'm fine with them. Shoot. I just sold it. I just sold that company to make bollards

778
0:57:02 --> 0:57:02
now

779
0:57:03 --> 0:57:07
If somebody could read the dollar short what's there with the monorail system?

780
0:57:07 --> 0:57:10
If only they could expand on the monorail system

781
0:57:10 --> 0:57:15
But that looks like it's going to get completely demolished at a certain point monorail right because there's no, um

782
0:57:16 --> 0:57:19
You don't have the replacement parts for the monorail. So now it's outdated

783
0:57:19 --> 0:57:23
So once it does bite the dust, we're we're we're stuck with it ridiculous and can't fix it

784
0:57:23 --> 0:57:28
Yeah, so, uh, maybe we'll have like tesla's driving themselves over the monorail

785
0:57:32 --> 0:57:37
Tesla does have like a subway car train type of thing that operates in

786
0:57:37 --> 0:57:45
Europe somewhere. I believe germany. I saw this story. I'm like wait, they actually can do this too. Why aren't they doing that here in vegas?

787
0:57:46 --> 0:57:49
And now their latest idea is well, what if we take the tesla's

788
0:57:50 --> 0:57:55
Underground put them above ground and now they can go to the airport for five bucks

789
0:57:55 --> 0:58:00
And we're like, okay, that sounds great. That sounds like a taxi with a super discount price

790
0:58:00 --> 0:58:03
That's not new tech. Nope

791
0:58:03 --> 0:58:09
Yeah, tesla operates a battery-powered shuttle train the giga train in germany for its giga factory in berlin

792
0:58:09 --> 0:58:14
Yeah, providing free transportation train. Yeah, this just like this just makes a lot of sense

793
0:58:15 --> 0:58:15
Yeah

794
0:58:15 --> 0:58:22
That's it. That's exactly that was exactly what uber did bitch. Where's my giga train is where i'm putting it out. We are

795
0:58:22 --> 0:58:24
we are

796
0:58:25 --> 0:58:28
Uber came in with a problem with saying no

797
0:58:28 --> 0:58:34
Yeah, and sometimes we should say no and say hey, how about what you're doing in germany? Let's do that. Yeah for sure

798
0:58:34 --> 0:58:40
It was was there any uh understanding of what that big green goopy pile of gunk was

799
0:58:40 --> 0:58:46
There was that weird mystery lake that they had created speaking of discharged water. Yeah

800
0:58:46 --> 0:58:53
Yeah there I mean, uh, it's funny because I think so much of the attention was how security handled that story

801
0:58:53 --> 0:58:59
So at their new station that they're building at the old firefly side if you remember that place on paradise

802
0:58:59 --> 0:59:03
So their latest um arms top is heading out

803
0:59:03 --> 0:59:05
it's heading out towards um

804
0:59:05 --> 0:59:06
unlv so

805
0:59:06 --> 0:59:11
You know, it's kind of going to give some accessibility to like the sphere area and all that

806
0:59:11 --> 0:59:17
But there's construction happening and there's a little kind of pool of greenish water out there

807
0:59:17 --> 0:59:23
And when a local station, I believe that was the cbs, uh klas affiliate here

808
0:59:23 --> 0:59:27
try to take some video of it what you're allowed to do from the sidewalk they

809
0:59:29 --> 0:59:31
Security shooed them away tried to cover it up

810
0:59:31 --> 0:59:36
So, you know if there's nothing wrong with that you would think well why are you trying to do that?

811
0:59:36 --> 0:59:40
I'm not going to totally jump to conclusions and just go with the headline. Yes

812
0:59:40 --> 0:59:46
It's a little weird and suspect but you know, it's up to them to explain what this is and from what i've seen so far

813
0:59:46 --> 0:59:48
They really haven't

814
0:59:48 --> 0:59:48
Yeah

815
0:59:48 --> 0:59:55
I mean it's it's up to you to explain what this luminous green pool of of sludge in the middle of the city is

816
0:59:55 --> 0:59:58
I heard that on that video that they made them delete was uh,

817
0:59:58 --> 1:00:02
Four turtles eating pizza and fighting each other get out of here

818
1:00:03 --> 1:00:08
Right out of the they were using uh, taekwondo. I think taekwondo turtles

819
1:00:08 --> 1:00:13
But all this in the name of having 12 cars drive you from one hotel to another underground

820
1:00:13 --> 1:00:17
I would like metro to take their drones and fly above this pool of green water

821
1:00:17 --> 1:00:24
Exactly, let's go lombardo fire them a little visit. Yeah, the giga train in germany carries 500 people per trip

822
1:00:25 --> 1:00:31
Just saying it's a lot more than four. Jesus. Yeah, that sounds convenient. Doesn't it? Yeah, it really does

823
1:00:31 --> 1:00:37
If only somebody had come up with the idea to put a train car underground like a a sub

824
1:00:38 --> 1:00:44
Train way tell me they couldn't refit the monorail. They could refit the monorail make it work

825
1:00:45 --> 1:00:48
Yeah, that's my vote no glory in it no ego in it paul

826
1:00:48 --> 1:00:52
There's no ego in it put the giga train on the monorail tracks and expand it

827
1:00:52 --> 1:00:55
Yeah, just bring it done. Yeah, bring it to where it needs to go

828
1:00:55 --> 1:01:00

1:18:59 --> 1:19:04
Respect and dread when actual other real podcasters join us on the show

Well, then you hear matt talk about how he reached out to multiple other people to get different angles on the story

1:19:20 --> 1:19:23
And nobody got back to him. Nobody got back to me
