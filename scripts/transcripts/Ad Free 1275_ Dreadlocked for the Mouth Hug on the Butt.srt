00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Thunder, Cougar Falcon, Scoop, and Travis Jaggery.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Great! Let's go!

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Happy New Year, everybody!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Happy New Year! Start off the New Year right.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 A guy was just awarded custody of his brother.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Here in Nevada, I think national news because he was sexually abused by his brother when he was a kid.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Turns out he was the father of his own brother.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Happy New Year!

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 This time, we're Matt and Maddly's ice cream social!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Sitting in a pool in his own mess, that's Matt Donnelly!

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Sitting in a pool in his own mess, that's also Paul Maddly!

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'm Jacob, we're PreachingFun!

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I was looking at the trending news in Nevada and...

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I shouldn't laugh, that's terrible!

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It is terrible. It is absolutely terrible.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 A man awarded custody.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It's horrible, but it's also horrible.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm only asking to empathize with me scrolling to be stopped with man awarded custody of his own brother.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And then you go to click the link, it says like a warning, sensitive material.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And that just was like, good lord, that's a hard guy to go on a first date with after this, you know?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Oh man!

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So tell me about your life recently!

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 How old is this boy now?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 The child that was awarded custody is early teens.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Okay.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 The gentleman is in his 20s.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And the mother is in jail.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Good! Good!

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I'm fine with that.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Honestly, I'm not even fine with that.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I don't want her to be in jail. I want her to be getting help or something.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's not a crazy sentence.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's like an eight-year sentence with parole kind of thing.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Good, good, good.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I mean, I say that as if I would last a week in prison.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Right.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I'm just thinking, what are the odds of her being a repeat offender?

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I could do a dime standing on my head.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So yeah.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 We're not all strong like you, Paul.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Also not all as strong as you.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Did we miss technicalscooport on the chat for the truck drivers?

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I don't know.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Technicalscooport.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Shout out to technicalscooport for the truck driving.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 If indeed we did not have your name on the list.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Might just be another list.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What are you talking about?

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Technicalscooport in the chat was asking about you didn't hear his name on the truck driver.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Oh, I missed that.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Technicalscooport, thank you very much.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 If I missed you on the list, I apologize.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 We appreciate each and every one of you guys just being a crybaby.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 No, not at all, technicalscooport.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 That's what you pay for and we appreciate you guys so, so much.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And we also, you paid for us to change the subject.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Perfect, perfect.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Yeah, no, that was great.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 That was my secret intention.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Coming up, there is a news article I read here.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I don't know if you guys have heard of it yet, but a man in Nevada was awarded custody of Big Brother.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And it turned out there was a twist that no one saw coming.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Oh boy, oh boy.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You know what the real twist is?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 What's that?

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Personal trainers hate him.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I did the, you know, you're singing a song to somebody else and they hear you do the wrong lyrics and they make fun of you for that?

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Yes.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I did that to myself in the car the other day.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 What'd you do?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 You caught yourself singing the wrong lyrics?

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I caught myself.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I was like, that can't be the right lyric.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I had the 90s station on and it was playing, oh, what's that song?

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Everlast, then you really might know what it's like.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You know what I'm talking about?

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 No, no, no, that's not Everlast.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah, that's Everlast.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 That's Everlast, right?

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 That's Everlast, yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I don't remember the name of the song.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 God forbid you ever have to walk a mile in her shoes.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 That one, yeah.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So I had the 90s station on and I was doing what Paul's doing.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I'm just singing along with it.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I'm like, yeah, this jam.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I remember this jam from like '96 or so.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 This is awesome, yeah.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And the hair on his face was dreadlocked for the mange.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Dreadlocked for the mange?

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Dreadlocked, yeah, for the mange.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I was like, oh, this man had to dreadlock the hair on his face

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 because he had such bad mange is apparently what I thought in the mid-90s.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 No, that's not how it goes.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It's close.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Correct, it's not how it goes.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 How would you handle the mange, Paul?

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You don't want to have to comb it out every day.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 No, but I'm thinking topical ointment.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 A salve?

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 A salve before dreadlocking it.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yuck, those things are going to come out in clumps.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Yep.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 That's going to just fall right off your face.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Also, it occurred to me as I was thinking about this in the car as I was driving,

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 dreadlocking hair wouldn't help with mange at all.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That wouldn't even be a good solution for mange.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Well, we do plenty of things in our lives that don't help

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 with the things that they're supposed to.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Well, that's true.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 That's true.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 All right, I'm back to dreadlocked for the mange.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 There's dreadlocks for the mange YouTube page, which swears by it.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Oh, yeah.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 People who said they'd done their research and they have different doctors

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 to testify that dreadlocking for the mange is perfectly well suited.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 What is the actual lyric?

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I'm looking it up right now.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's just like hair full of mange.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 The hair on his face.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Oh, I was much closer than I thought I was.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I was going to say you're very close.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Dreadlocked and full of mange.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yeah.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I'm not as far off on this lyric as I assume.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 No, you're being too hard on yourself in that car.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 You got to go back there and say, I owe you an apology, Jacob.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Yeah, I owe past Jacob an apology.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I was too harsh on him.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Don't worry.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'm sure there are other lyrics in this song.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 If I go through all the lyrics in this song,

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I'm sure there are others that I'm just absolutely wrong on.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 If there's a chance you might get interrupted,

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I might have to leave to show a plumber my toilet that's not working.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 No.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Matt has to go fuck a plumber.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Yeah.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Oh, shit.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But nonetheless, I have another story.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I've had so many lately, the man of the hour intro.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Oh, the man of the hour.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I haven't gotten over the man of the hour.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 We'll get through this.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 The guy complaining about me in front of me, the cruise ship thing.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 That's good.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 My debacle as a soccer coach.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I saw your wife the other night at the show,

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 and I did something that I rarely do, which I stood up to give her a hug.

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I felt like she needed it after having heard the boys' soccer story.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I was like, you don't know why I'm giving you a hug,

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 but I feel like you just need a hug.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 You're closing out the year strong.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Isn't that what they say about the new year?

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 When it goes to shit, then the rest of your year is going to be,

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 your new year is going to be good and that kind of thing.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I hope so.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That's an assumption, right?

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 I mean, as Matt Donnelly, famous set in 2019,

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 next year's got to be better.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I believe I did say that, right?

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 I think that's a legit, that's a legit quote.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I have a neighbor who's a douche.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Okay.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And I don't think I've talked about too much on the pod.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 No, you don't want to put your neighborhood on blast.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 How far down is he?

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He's across the street and down two doors.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He's on the corner.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It's not Chad's old house or anything.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 No, no, no.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Across the street.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 So it's not a direct neighbor, which is good.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Yeah.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Close enough.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Adjacent.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Close enough.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 You can see his home from your windows.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Yeah.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Yeah, yeah.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 From my driveway, you can see his house.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 His house.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 You know, we're catty, whatever it is.

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yeah, catty corner.

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Matt can throw a cat in his house.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Yeah.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Ain't that far.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And so in the past-

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 What did this douche do?

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 In the past, he's yelled at children in the neighborhood.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Oh.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 For things going on in his yard.

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Oh, this isn't the no-cones guy, is it?

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 No, right?

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 So the no-cones guy, I think, either moved or just accepted that maybe-

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Gave up.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Gave up.

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 That maybe he was possibly going to run over children and maybe chilled out.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I don't know.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 One or the other.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Maybe he got therapy.

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Maybe he got therapy.

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And once again, my kids got older and more agile.

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So it was like-

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 That's true.

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 That's true.

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 It was less of a deal.

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 They don't need the cones as much.

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And no, this guy's yelled at children in the past, but not my children.

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And so I've heard tales of him yelling at children before, but I never came to it face

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 to face.

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 But I was at the grocery store, and then my wife and I missed cross-hairs text, so we

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 ended up both at the grocery store together getting last minute things for a party we're

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 going to throw tomorrow.

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Don't.

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 We're going to do your run tomorrow, but three to five for having people over.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Oh, nice.

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And Paul, you're not invited.

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And-

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I knew it.

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I fucking knew it.

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,700
 And she's like, "I guess the neighbor's just cursed at our kids."

236
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,000
 And I was like, "Oh."

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,260
 Oh, no.

238
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,000
 And so I was like, "Oh, I got it."

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I was like, "Well, that's not okay."

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yeah.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And I was like, "I guess I should go talk to them."

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,320
 How much of your inner monologue at this point is, "Can I get away with not dealing with

243
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
 this at all?"

244
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,000
 Well, this is, you know, I mean, I'll say that's always my first instinct, right?

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 My first instinct is like, "Oh, hide and do nothing."

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Right?

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Because I mean, this is not going to be a fun conversation.

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 No, I don't anticipate it going well.

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 No, I don't.

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,800
 Because he has been across from us like, you know, I mean, this is no surprise to you.

251
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,840
 We are neighborly, especially my wife.

252
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,000
 We know all of our neighbors.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Y'all know your neighbors.

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,800
 And these guys have been here for the whole time and we do not talk at all.

255
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,640
 And they've ignored us every time we try to hide from them in the past.

256
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,100
 Real grumpers, eh?

257
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,760
 Just total grumpers.

258
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
 A lot of people go in and out of that house who don't even know if there's one or two

259
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,080
 families in there.

260
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
 It's just one of those that goes on.

261
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,080
 It's that kind of situation.

262
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,800
 There's something, there's fishiness and that's why they're all standoff.

263
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,280
 You think it's a bunch of mobsters going to the mattresses for a potential mob war?

265
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,760
 You think that's what's going on in there?

266
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,720
 I noticed there's a lot of distribution of ammunition and different guns from the trunks.

267
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,080
 I've noticed a bunch of Tommy guns being passed out over here.

268
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,680
 You joke, but there's some shit like that that for real goes down out of these Vegas

269
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,720
 residential.

270
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
 It's no joke.

271
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 There is.

272
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
 It's kind of a joke.

273
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,560
 Yeah, this kind of seems to be like in his own business, his own, whatever, any man,

274
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,640
 something, some kind of business, but he has two big trucks.

275
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:59,160
 He's loading in and out all the time with different stuff, but yeah, so a good neighborhood

276
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,500
 kid overthrew my son and the ball rolled off the street up onto his driveway underneath

277
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,060
 his truck and he came out and screamed at my children to keep their shit away from my

278
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,800
 shit.

279
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,640
 So there was a ball on his property?

280
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,800
 Was a kid trying to get the ball at this point?

281
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,760
 As a matter of fact, because of the past, my son was waiting for the ball to roll back

282
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,920
 down the driveway in which it did.

283
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
 So he was even doing what he's supposed to do?

284
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
 Yes.

285
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,760
 Oh, come on.

286
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,680
 When we first moved into this house, the house that we live in now, we have close neighbors

287
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,720
 and we're in a cul-de-sac and the neighbors that we had when we first moved in, kind of

288
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,160
 kiddy corner across from us, they had a bunch of kids and the kids were always out.

289
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,560
 Our big cul-de-sac is not technically a street.

290
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,640
 It's technically a shared private drive between our four houses right here.

291
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,640
 And so, and obviously it's a cul-de-sac because it's done a lot of traffic.

292
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,440
 So the kids would be out riding bikes and skateboarding and doing all that stuff all

293
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,520
 the time and one of the younger ones, because we have kind of a circular drive in front

294
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,440
 of our house as well.

295
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,140
 And so they would cut through the circular drive all the time.

296
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
 Not a big deal.

297
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,140
 Who cares?

298
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,920
 But once or twice, one of the younger ones would come up like all the way up to our front

299
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,800
 porch and you know, just skating around doing whatever because there's concrete all the

300
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 way up there.

301
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,520
 He wasn't doing anything, but he'd just come up, he'd come all the way up there.

302
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520
 And so one day I had to go over and talk to his parents who were very nice people.

303
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,400
 Just a giant Mormon family.

304
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,240
 So they just had kids everywhere.

305
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,720
 They were just quiver full.

306
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 Yeah.

307
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
 I think there were like 12 people living in the house at one point with this one with

308
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
 this one family.

309
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
 That's outrageous.

310
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
 But they were lovely and they were a very, very, very, very nice family.

311
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
 I miss them.

312
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
 They're, they're great.

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
 They were, they were good neighbors, but like I had to go have the conversation with the

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,520
 dad who's just standing outside, it's like, Hey, maybe just ask your, your kiddos to not

315
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,400
 like if they're in the driveway there, I don't care if they're in front of the house.

316
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,960
 I don't care if they're in front of the garages.

317
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,520
 I don't care.

318
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,040
 The front porch, like their windows straight into the house there.

319
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,520
 I don't really want them right up there.

320
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
 Yeah.

321
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,680
 So maybe, maybe talk to them.

322
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,120
 And that was an awkward as fuck conversation.

323
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
 Yes.

324
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,960
 And we were both being very civil and I didn't like it at all.

325
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,040
 Now this guy's just yelling because a ball was in his driveway for a minute and it removed

326
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,020
 itself seemingly of its own accord with, with the assistance of gravity.

327
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
 It removed itself.

328
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,320
 So I was like, it's time to go talk.

329
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,640
 That's a lot of, that's a lot of anger.

330
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 I know.

331
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,920
 And this thing is like, and I'm, it's my neighbor, right?

332
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,480
 So the whole point, tell him I had, I'm like, I have to, one, he's going to yell at me.

333
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
 I have to prepare myself.

334
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,640
 He's going to yell.

335
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,760
 He's not going to be like, Oh, he's not going to be a two-faced person.

336
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,040
 Which I'm like, Oh no, me.

337
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
 I love those kiddos.

338
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
 Like he's that fucking.

339
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,640
 His voice is going to be raised.

340
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,280
 My first thought would be maybe take him a gift.

341
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,920
 Um, well, that wasn't, that wasn't my thought.

342
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:21,720
 But uh, uh, uh, I baseball is a baseball because it's been a few incidents over the years.

343
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,120
 Not a lot, but a few years, I don't know if adult ever got involved before.

344
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,480
 So I was like, I have to just go over there and have a conversation with him just to know

345
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,880
 that adult is, is, is also part of this conversation, right?

346
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,280
 He had been hanging out in his car when it happened and he was hanging out his car.

347
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,840
 When I went over, he'd been hanging out his car all day doing business from his car.

348
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,360
 Oh, Oh, this is not a happy person.

349
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
 No.

350
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,760
 So I thought I was going to go to the front door.

351
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,640
 He was already in his car and he rolls down his window.

352
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,680
 And I said, he doesn't get out, he just rolls down the window.

353
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
 Yeah.

354
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,920
 And I said, Hey man, you can't be cursing at children.

355
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
 Yeah.

356
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,400
 And he goes, I didn't, I didn't curse it.

357
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 First of all, I didn't car.

358
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 Boom.

359
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,960
 He's out of his door, uh, in my face and tell me I didn't curse it.

360
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
 Any children.

361
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,400
 And he goes, I have, I record everything.

362
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,440
 He points, he gestures as if he has cameras all over his house and his car says, I recorded

363
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
 everything.

364
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
 And I said, great.

365
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 Play it.

366
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
 And I said, awesome.

367
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
 Play it for me.

368
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
 And I'll apologize.

369
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 Yeah.

370
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,800
 And he goes, I have to fucking play, fucking play anything for you.

371
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 Fuck you.

372
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 Like I am ready to be wrong.

373
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 Show me that I'm wrong.

374
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
 I'm ready to be wrong.

375
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,680
 I will, I will yell at my kids.

376
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,520
 I will, I will beat them to with it for lying about you saying shit to them.

377
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,680
 Show me the video and I will beat my children.

378
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
 No.

379
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,880
 And he immediately starts cursing a lot.

380
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,840
 So I'm like, I'm skeptical that he didn't, he didn't curse it.

381
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
 I'm skeptical.

382
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:00,000
 If someone comes to me and says, Hey, you can't curse in front of X, I assume that I

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,120
 did indeed curse, whether I remember cursing or not, that's where I start from.

384
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,320
 And he then he's like, you had never talked to me until this moment, blah, blah, blah,

385
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,760
 blah, blah, which I was like food.

386
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,440
 I've tried to say hi to you like a million times and you've ignored me.

387
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
 So I was like, check the recordings, man.

388
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 Exactly.

389
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,840
 So I let that pass.

390
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,440
 And then I was like, I was like, I was like, and I basically was like, you, you, you can

391
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,920
 have everything you want without screaming at kids.

392
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
 That's been my whole point.

393
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 Yeah.

394
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,960
 You can keep the kids out of your property.

395
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,720
 You can do that without screaming and cursing it at my kids, but he's getting, he's getting,

396
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
 he's getting music.

397
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 You come over here.

398
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
 You're going to get in my face.

399
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 You can just see this, you know, whatever.

400
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
 He goes, kiss my ass, kiss my fucking ass.

401
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 Kiss my ass.

402
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:52,040
 I say, I say if I kiss your ass, will you be nicer to the kids?

403
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 Nice.

404
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,320
 That really threw him.

405
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
 I'm sure.

406
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,800
 And he said, but, and I said, if I kiss your ass right now, will you be nicer to the children?

407
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 What if I spin you around?

408
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,840
 What if I, what if I give you a blow job right now?

409
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,560
 I will, I will blow you in this driveway.

410
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,000
 He literally like got jarred by that, that he actually like instinctively turned his

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,320
 butt towards me.

412
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,240
 Like while he was still being angry, he was like, Oh yeah, he wanted it.

413
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
 So then I, I bent over, but I kissed my hand.

414
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,760
 I kissed my hand and I, yeah, boop.

415
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
 I touched his butt.

416
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
 Tapped him.

417
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
 Yep.

418
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
 Yeah.

419
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 I gave him a little.

420
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
 There you go.

421
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
 Good.

422
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 Good.

423
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
 Which triggered his gay stuff alarm.

424
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,080
 And then he got even more angry again and was like, don't you fucking touch me.

425
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
 You fucking touch me.

426
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
 Fuck away from me.

427
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,120
 Blah, blah, blah, blah.

428
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,920
 He, yeah, that, uh, Mark in the chat, that was a Freudian turn on the neighbor's part

429
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
 for sure.

430
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
 Oh, a hundred percent.

431
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
 For sure.

432
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
 This guy's filled with self hatred.

433
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,120
 This is becoming more and more apparent.

434
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,040
 The, the more we look into all of this stuff and I can speak personal, not personal, but

435
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,000
 interpersonal experience.

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,240
 A lot of this shit is coming from repressed gay people.

437
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
 Oh, sure.

438
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,280
 Don't have a way they, and it just, the self hatred that gets festered in.

439
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
 Repressed anything.

440
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
 Like there's, there's something.

441
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 Anything.

442
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
 Yeah.

443
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,680
 There's something inside this guy that he's, that he's furious about.

444
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,800
 You know, the Kinsey scale is not exactly the most accurate thing in the world, but the

445
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,960
 idea that we have different wavering amounts of.

446
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
 Oh, absolute.

447
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
 We're all on the spectrum.

448
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
 Bisexuality.

449
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
 Right.

450
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,640
 So you gotta be aware enough to be like, oh yeah, there's, I mean, there's a needle that

451
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
 moves when Trent Reznor comes into the conversation.

452
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
 Yes.

453
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 You know what I mean?

454
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,880
 I've asked you over and over again, not to refer to your dick as a needle.

455
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
 Don't, I want you to be happier about yourself.

456
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 Oh no, no, no.

457
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,000
 It's, it's, there's more girth than that.

458
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,280
 I'm not, we're not, we're not playing records.

459
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
 Okay.

460
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
 Okay.

461
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
 Good.

462
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,960
 I mean, it's, it's a success because he was a piece of ass and men like it's going to

463
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
 see him in concert, but it was, he was an attractive guy.

464
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,680
 I mean, the, the, the, what the album cover with his dick on it.

465
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 Yeah.

466
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 Yeah.

467
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
 There's an album cover.

468
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,000
 It's just like zoomed in on his, on his crotch.

469
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 No, you zoomed in.

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 It was a regular shot.

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,040
 You zoomed in on his crotch.

472
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,920
 Oh, I wondered why a magnifying glass was taped onto that album cover.

473
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,680
 No, that's what I mean is like, yes, I do.

474
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
 I do believe Paul.

475
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
 I actually do.

476
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:36,500
 It's like, it just, it's just this gay hatred stuff just really, really comes from really

477
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,400
 straight quote unquote straight men, hating gay men and gay activities.

478
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 Right.

479
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,880
 And that's why transfers to trance, because if you were actually attracted to someone

480
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,600
 presenting female that was born male, then suddenly you think something's terrible with

481
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 yourself.

482
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 Yeah.

483
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,300
 It's like they just, it's jealousy too.

484
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,720
 It's like, how dare someone live their life open and free, embracing their identity.

485
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
 I don't get to do that.

486
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,680
 And that was the thing I mentioned this before to Jacob the other day.

487
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,920
 Were we talking about, it's not a podcast or whatever it was, but how, when it gets

488
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
 to a certain point.

489
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,080
 No, no, that was just a FaceTime that you and I had a late night, our, our, our no pants

490
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
 FaceTimes.

491
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,840
 We were talking about how, uh, I got disinvited to no pants FaceTimes.

492
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
 When did I lose my invite?

493
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,280
 No, no, we're just, we're splitting them.

494
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
 We're just splitting them.

495
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
 Disinvited is a strong word, disinvited is a strong word.

496
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,720
 We agreed, Jacob and I both agreed that we got a little turned off the last time.

497
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,520
 Uh, so we wanted to keep it.

498
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,640
 We wanted to keep it a little more spicy.

499
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:41,460
 Just me and Jacob, uh, no, uh, this is the thing, uh, when a lot of, uh, hardcore religious

500
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:51,240
 types want to adamantly say that sexuality is a choice that is coming from their reality

501
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,680
 in which they must choose to repress their natural instinct.

502
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,280
 And they think everyone has to undergo that same choice where we do not, it is, you know,

503
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,120
 and yeah, it's just, it's hard.

504
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,640
 No, I mean, I think there's like, like, uh, um, uh, my buddy Mike Mills, who's producing

505
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 the joker's tour.

506
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,800
 He's also producing this documentary, um, anyhow, I can't, I don't think I can talk

507
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,880
 about what it is or what it's about, but, uh, one part of it that he was talking to

508
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,320
 me about was the studying was basically people did, uh, study, um, uh, basically hook up

509
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,400
 meters to people's, uh, penises to show them pictures to like about twinges when they saw

510
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 stuff.

511
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 Yes.

512
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 Oh, that was, that was an official study.

513
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
 That was an official study.

514
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
 So if you've been doing on your own, Jacob, you need to share that data.

515
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
 Okay.

516
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
 Oh, yeah.

517
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
 I had no idea.

518
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,840
 Does my tongue count as a meter?

519
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
 Yes.

520
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 It does.

521
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 Okay.

522
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
 It's a meat.

523
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 All right.

524
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,480
 So that and how you eat a Reese's peanut butter cup is intense, Paul.

525
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
 It's intense.

526
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
 We should talk about it.

527
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 Brother.

528
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,320
 I put the work on them Reese's they're never the same.

529
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,640
 So I was like a typewriter, but, um, typewriter and two bites and that's it.

530
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,040
 So there's a legit, basically just say there's legitimately studied the kind of like self

531
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,280
 hatred of feeling gay feelings is a real, is a real thing.

532
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
 Yeah.

533
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,800
 And I, and I guess much more prevalent than we ever think about, right?

534
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 That's the thing is that it's more, that's, that's what always blows my mind.

535
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,560
 It's like, they keep putting out these studies like, Oh, 10% of the population.

536
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
 Bullshit.

537
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
 Bullshit.

538
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
 That's low.

539
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
 That's right.

540
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,160
 That's way, that's gotta be so fucking low.

541
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
 That's low.

542
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
 Right.

543
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,200
 But that's not always been the statistic that we've always had the people.

544
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,280
 If you just count the people that get on television and yell about how evil gay people are.

545
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,720
 If that's more than 10% of the population right there.

546
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 I mean, if you involve yourself with theater for 10 minutes, you go, Oh yeah.

547
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
 Okay.

548
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
 Great.

549
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
 Yeah.

550
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 This is cool.

551
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,560
 But 10% no, I don't think so.

552
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
 Anyway.

553
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
 Yeah.

554
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,960
 Service industry, Sean in the comments saying service industry.

555
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
 Yeah.

556
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
 Yeah.

557
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
 Anywhere, anywhere.

558
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
 That's the other thing.

559
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 It's not even just, it doesn't have to be theater.

560
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,720
 It doesn't have to be services, any, any job you go, Oh wait, there's more than 10% here.

561
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Okay.

562
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 Do the math, but we can't do the math because education has been completely systematically

563
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,200
 defunded.

564
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,480
 We have to bring people in from other countries to do the math.

565
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,080
 We can't do that anymore either.

566
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
 Nope.

567
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
 God damn it.

568
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
 They don't like us.

569
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,600
 Oh, not only that, that is not allowing it.

570
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,560
 No, I guess our shouting was creating a commotion in the neighborhood as, as I was trying not

571
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,240
 to shout, but I raised my voice a few times, but both of course, but, but the one time

572
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 I was, the most I yelled was when I was going, I am trying to deescalate.

573
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,600
 I'm trying to make this more chill.

574
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,560
 I am not trying to be in your face.

575
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,800
 I don't know how I would react if someone cursed at my children.

576
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
 So it was really, I mean, I was drove home steaming.

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,400
 I was really, really angry.

578
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,840
 I wouldn't react well if I, if somebody told me that somebody cursed at your children.

579
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
 Right.

580
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
 Exactly.

581
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 Exactly.

582
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,640
 Like if somebody was like, Hey, that guy just yelled at Matt's kids and be like, God damn

583
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 it.

584
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,600
 And you have to like, uh, like, you know, it's a neighbor.

585
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 Right.

586
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,680
 And we both been there for a long time.

587
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,180
 And yeah, that's not going to change.

588
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,940
 So you got to watch it because you don't want to just not, yeah, you don't want to be coming

589
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,400
 home to do not call this.

590
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
 Yep.

591
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
 Do not call the registration car hotline.

592
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
 Oh my God.

593
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
 Right.

594
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
 Can you imagine?

595
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
 Yeah.

596
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,160
 Oh, Myra in the chat wants to know, did your discussion get reported in the, in the nosy

597
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
 neighbor board?

598
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,200
 Oh, I, you know, I honestly have to go check cause I, I, I always end up, I click on one

599
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,200
 thing and also they get like a thousand emails and after like a week, I'm like, wait, I want

600
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:53,400
 to stop all these emails and I unsubscribe it is, it is the flow that we all go exactly.

601
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,920
 So I have to go back, but uh, I mean, multiple neighbors were texting, but I'm yelling in

602
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 the first place.

603
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,840
 And then obviously when I was screaming, but my wife came out and said, all right, basically

604
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,640
 in the net, no, no, just loudly goes, all right, she, she goes, all right, you tried,

605
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,200
 you tried to do the right thing and just said it nice to him and we just walked away or

606
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
 whatever.

607
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,800
 But, uh, it was, it was Sarah's just the best man.

608
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 Yes.

609
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,960
 I was about to say, there are so many things that I can think of that I would rather have

610
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,120
 happened to me than be the neighbor of Sarah Lowe and have her, have her mad at me.

611
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,240
 Well, you know, she'll win.

612
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,040
 Like she has the whole neighborhood wrapped around her finger.

613
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 Right.

614
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
 Exactly.

615
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
 Exactly.

616
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,800
 No, I mean like she could probably sell his house, Leon in the chat, you tried the right

617
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
 thing.

618
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:49,760
 That was actually the only like comforting thing is he, he seems, he's always been very

619
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,480
 intimidating from his truck, but when he actually got out and got in my face, I was like, Oh,

620
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:01,440
 there's a reason why you stay in that truck, buddy with big old truck.

621
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
 What do you know?

622
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,520
 So you shouldn't try to give him a hug.

623
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,920
 Look, I hate when you hug him.

624
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
 I went further than I thought.

625
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
 Yeah.

626
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
 That was pretty far.

627
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,240
 That was kissing ass.

628
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
 That's pretty far.

629
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,080
 I'll tell you who else tried to give their neighbor a mouth hug on his butt and that's

630
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,200
 the following sponsor.

631
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 Today's show.

632
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,920
 Man Manley's ice cream social is brought to you by Karen's cakes and cookies.

633
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
 That's right.

634
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,480
 From New Hampshire caveman in 2023.

635
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
 That's Karen's cakes and cookies.

636
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:39,040
 Hey, I don't know who made this, but it's not right.

637
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:47,280
 It's just off something that's sugar, too much sugar in the mix or something, but the

638
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,200
 icing is just a little bit runny or who knows the colors just a little bit off.

639
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,040
 Hi, I'm Karen for Karen's cakes and cookies.

640
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,840
 Every time you order, you're going to get something a little bit wrong.

641
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 It's not going to be quite right.

642
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,760
 You're going to have to speak to the manager.

643
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,160
 That's the Karen's cookies and cakes guarantee.

644
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,960
 You will always have to speak directly to someone in charge to fix the shit you got

645
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,040
 from your order.

646
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
 It will never be right.

647
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
 It will always have a mistake.

648
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,880
 I promise you that or I'll talk about your fucking hair, bitch.

649
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 Get out of my store.

650
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,120
 I can refuse you.

651
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
 That's right.

652
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
 Better a scoops of check out.

653
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,160
 I just wanted cupcakes for my kid's birthday.

654
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,600
 Well, you know what?

655
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,160
 People wanted to not stare at that fucking bird's nest of a bullshit beehive you got

656
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 going on.

657
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,480
 Get the fuck out.

658
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,760
 I can have done the salon every week.

659
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
 Whoa.

660
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
 Oh, salon selectives.

661
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
 Where are you going?

662
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,520
 Is that salon deon?

663
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Salon deon.

664
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
 Salon deon.

665
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,720
 How is there not a salon deon in Las Vegas already?

666
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 I don't know.

667
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
 Well, there is now.

668
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
 I'm sure I've put it out there in the zeitgeist.

669
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
 It'll happen.

670
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
 Come on, people.

671
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
 Hey, Matt.

672
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 Far across your hairline.

673
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
 Okay, go ahead.

674
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 Oh my God.

675
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
 There should be a salon deon.

676
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
 Why is it not?

677
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
 Oh, that's so perfect.

678
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,760
 And follicles between us.

679
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
 Yeah.

680
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
 Salon deon.

681
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
 Your extensions will go on.

682
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
 Man.

683
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
 Forget it.

684
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
 Your extensions will go on.

685
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
 It's right there.

686
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
 That's all right there.

687
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
 This is give me shit.

688
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
 Right there.

689
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
 This is give me shit.

690
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
 Matt.

691
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 Yes, sir.

692
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
 Speaking of your children.

693
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
 Yes.

694
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,760
 I have been watching Keeler in Pluribus.

695
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:41,920
 I have been holding off because my wife watches like two episodes and I have a year.

696
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,520
 Her year's resolution is to watch television again.

697
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,200
 Like she has stopped watching.

698
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,040
 So when you guys want to watch Pluribus, when you guys watch Pluribus, there will be moments

699
00:29:51,040 --> 00:30:00,760
 where you go, our son is starring as an angry, lonely lesbian, fighting a world plague.

700
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
 It's pretty amazing.

701
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
 I didn't think about it.

702
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,280
 I didn't think about it until Paul said it.

703
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,960
 We're two episodes into Pluribus.

704
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
 And Paul is just correct.

705
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
 I'm right.

706
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,800
 I mean, I'm not out here to talk shit.

707
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,040
 I'm not talking shit.

708
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,280
 He's got a handsome lad.

709
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,760
 He's got, he's got movie star looks clearly.

710
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
 He is.

711
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
 He is right now.

712
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
 TV series looks.

713
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,240
 He's currently, he is currently Bowie ask.

714
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,360
 So I understand what you were saying about him.

715
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
 Yes.

716
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
 Yes.

717
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
 He's got the longish hair.

718
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 Yeah.

719
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,400
 He's got this kind of thing going on something about the facial symmetry with this woman

720
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
 in this movie.

721
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,360
 When he was younger, he looked exactly like Charlie from Charlie and the chocolate factory.

722
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
 Right.

723
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
 Yes.

724
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,360
 Really weird thing from the Willy Wonka, the chocolate factory from the old one, from

725
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 the Gene Wilder one.

726
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
 Yeah.

727
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
 Yeah.

728
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
 Your son is absolutely Carol.

729
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,280
 If you're watching pluribus and you don't know what Keeler looks like, yes, you do.

730
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
 Yeah.

731
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
 That's it.

732
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
 Yes, you do.

733
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 That's exactly.

734
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,540
 If my son can act half as good as Ray Seahorn, then we're in the money because Ray Seahorn's

735
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,800
 absolutely amazing as an actor.

736
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
 So no problem there.

737
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 No, no.

738
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I am.

739
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Where am I?

740
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I finished up.

741
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Oh, mayors of Kingstown.

742
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Oh, good.

743
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,680
 Probably the best season is the first season, season three and season two and three were

744
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,240
 a little wonky, but season four was really good.

745
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,960
 But it's still hilarious.

746
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,680
 Like these shows, these Taylor Sheridan shows, like when you can commit mass murder and then

747
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,800
 like just go eat afterward to be like, oh, now that that's over with, let's, let's chow

748
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,680
 and talk about that some other time.

749
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,760
 Because I was like the funniest thing to me, not like we should seek trauma counseling or

750
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
 whatever.

751
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
 But

752
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,520
 I would love it if Taylor Sheridan shows just got really real, just really real.

753
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,360
 I'm only one episode into the low down.

754
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
 Have you guys been watching that at all?

755
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
 No.

756
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 What's his name?

757
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
 Ethan Hawke.

758
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
 It was on.

759
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
 It's on Hulu.

760
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 Okay.

761
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
 Oh, my plumber's here.

762
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
 All right.

763
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
 Good.

764
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
 I was only talking about TV show, so it should be, it should be hard to hand this off.

765
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 Okay.

766
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
 All right.

767
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 Paul.

768
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
 Yes.

769
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
 Rating the rock vault closed last night.

770
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,440
 Oh, you know, and it really broke my heart.

771
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,680
 I saw all these postings from SJ and other folks because I follow a lot of rock vault

772
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,600
 people and rock vault itself.

773
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,360
 I did promotional work for them for a couple of years.

774
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,680
 Got to see the show many times early, different iterations.

775
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,240
 Then got to just see it as a fan to go see SJ a couple of times.

776
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,520
 This is heartbreaking.

777
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,640
 This is definitely a...

778
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
 It's the end of an era.

779
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
 It's the end of an era.

780
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,560
 It's a victim of where Vegas is right now with the decline in tourism.

781
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,200
 And I think, you know, just shifting trends like always.

782
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
 What's your take on it, Jacob?

783
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
 I mean, I think it's part of that.

784
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
 I think it's certainly part of that.

785
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,920
 I think that has to do with it.

786
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:54,720
 It's also, I mean, when we first moved here, all the shows at the big casinos here were

787
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,920
 Broadway shows.

788
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
 Right.

789
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
 Yeah.

790
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,040
 The first show I did out here was Spamalot.

791
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,260
 And then the kind of new wave of shows came in and Absinthe was part of that new wave

792
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,920
 of shows coming in back then.

793
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,200
 And rock vault was as well.

794
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,760
 Rock vault was part of that class.

795
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
 Yes.

796
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,200
 They were just a year or so after Absinthe.

797
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
 I mean, they were real close.

798
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,440
 And there aren't many of that class of shows left in town.

799
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
 No.

800
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
 Part of it is just the time.

801
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:33,720
 I mean, it's so goddamn hard to run a show here, especially a show of any size where

802
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,920
 you're trying to get hundreds of people in every night to come see it.

803
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,100
 There's so much competition.

804
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,800
 There's so much competition for people to spend entertainment money on here between

805
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,040
 other shows, clubs, gambling, celebrity chefs, all these things.

806
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,280
 But yeah, going and watching the end of rock vault in Las Vegas last night.

807
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,940
 And they're supposed to go on tour.

808
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,160
 They might do a little bit of touring here and there.

809
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,260
 I know they're going to do some touring coming up.

810
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,360
 I don't know just how long that's going to last.

811
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,120
 But yeah, I mean, it's definitely the end of a crazy long thing.

812
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
 Matt's back.

813
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,120
 We're talking about rock vault closed in Las Vegas last night, Matt.

814
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
 Oh yes, yes, yes.

815
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
 End of an era.

816
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,840
 It's heartbreaking too because losing that stratum of show, losing more of those kind

817
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:28,520
 of shows, because for a long time in Las Vegas, shows and entertainment in general was considered

818
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,200
 something of a loss leader.

819
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,600
 It was a way to get people into your property.

820
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,720
 You would just, you know, comp some people tickets, charge low fees to have folks come

821
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,560
 and watch the show for a little bit.

822
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,500
 And it just got foot traffic into your venue and then got people gambling.

823
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 That was the thing.

824
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,080
 Now it was, you know, it was the, the building that you were in owned the show that you were

825
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
 seeing in that bill.

826
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
 Right.

827
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,900
 And it was all, it was all part of the same ownership group that was doing everything.

828
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:02,800
 Now everything's four walled, if that, and you're still being treated as a loss leader,

829
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,160
 but you've got to try and make profit for yourself.

830
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,720
 And it's just kind of the whole, the whole thing is backwards.

831
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
 How did you know?

832
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,240
 Because now instead of Sid Caesar sitting up in the, in the office at Caesar's palace,

833
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,520
 I assume he owned Caesar's palace.

834
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
 It was Sid Caesar.

835
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
 Yes.

836
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
 Yeah.

837
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,680
 Instead of Sid sitting up there saying like, this is going to be here and this is going

838
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
 to be here.

839
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,120
 You know, he's just up there renting out rooms and like, Oh, you can come rent out my show

840
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:32,320
 room and put on a show and you can pay me a lot of money per week to use my show room.

841
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,400
 And I, I sure hope you sell tickets and you're able to make money and keep on paying me my

842
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
 rent.

843
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
 Right.

844
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
 Because that's what I care about.

845
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 Good luck and God bless.

846
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
 Yep.

847
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
 They don't give a shit.

848
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,440
 Uh, and, and that's, that's just more bullshit because it's just different.

849
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,720
 I don't even look at that as a bad thing.

850
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
 I just look at that as a different thing.

851
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,120
 I look at it as a different setup.

852
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,800
 The thing basically like, um, the problem is all these casinos that are still operating

853
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,720
 are holding on by a threat right now.

854
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
 Yes.

855
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
 No, that's it.

856
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
 And so like, there's no place to innovate or invest.

857
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,840
 And so they're all just saving their own asses.

858
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,920
 And so like basically innovation part, I think we're, I think we're hurting from the lack

859
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,000
 of innovation now.

860
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,040
 Someone new needs to see an opportunity in this space, specifically in Las Vegas strip

861
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,240
 to come in and do something crazy.

862
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,400
 The last person I tried was resorts world, which their big innovation was three hotels

863
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,040
 or one hotel Voltron Voltron was their plan.

864
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,120
 Remember the original plans for their resorts world.

865
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,920
 Remember they had a Panda habitat.

866
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
 They are going to have a stadium.

867
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,000
 They were going to have all this stuff and then all of a sudden when Bush came to shove,

868
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,720
 it was just three hotels.

869
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
 Yeah.

870
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,120
 And, and so like it's going to take like a big sweeping thing from an order of magnitude,

871
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,520
 but basically these companies have all found a way to not go away.

872
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,840
 Like normally some of these companies would have shuttered in the past, which would have

873
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,080
 let someone else come in and dig over a big exception is what's happening at the hard

874
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,560
 rock, uh, which Jacob point out before the show came on where they're building a giant

875
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,600
 electric guitar tower.

876
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,320
 That's going to change the look of the strip or whatever.

877
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,800
 That's that's a different, totally different casino company than the ones that have come

878
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 in in the past.

879
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,920
 That's the, um, seminal, right?

880
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,480
 The seminal, the seminal tribe, I believe.

881
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
 Yeah.

882
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,420
 They own the hard rock, but even they like they're doing something like what they're doing.

883
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
 It's the old Mirage.

884
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,720
 It used to be the MGM Mirage and they tore down the volcano and everything in the, in

885
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,840
 the front of it.

886
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,000
 And they're building a giant guitar shaped, uh, tower of a hotel suites there in the,

887
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 in the front.

888
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,600
 And then they're going to revamp the Mirage towers as well and make that part of the hard

889
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,320
 rock and, uh, for people who don't know.

890
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
 But the guitar, even that's not even exactly innovation.

891
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,440
 That's something new in Vegas, but they're just copying something that they've already

892
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
 done in Miami.

893
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
 Right.

894
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,400
 They also had a big ass guitar in Vegas a couple of years ago.

895
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,120
 It wasn't as big, but they had, that was a big one in front of the old hard rock, uh,

896
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
 casino.

897
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
 This is a, yeah.

898
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
 Yeah.

899
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
 This is a building.

900
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
 No, I know.

901
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
 It's a, it's a mega structure at this point.

902
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
 Yeah.

903
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,640
 This is like, that was a big guitar set up in front of a building.

904
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
 This is an actual building.

905
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
 Yeah.

906
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
 It's pretty crazy.

907
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
 It's shaped like a guitar.

908
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
 Yeah.

909
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
 Anyways.

910
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
 Yeah.

911
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
 But rock rock fault is closing up, which is such a shame.

912
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
 I just went saw disco last night.

913
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
 Disco is closing this weekend.

914
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,400
 Um, and, uh, but these are shows that, these are shows that would have worked in the past

915
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,200
 where people are coming here going like, what should I do?

916
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,360
 What's around, you know?

917
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,600
 And, uh, it's just not, it's just not the way Vegas operates anymore.

918
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,860
 So in the short term, it would help is, uh, right.

919
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,120
 Maybe if foreigners didn't hate coming here, that would help a lot.

920
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
 Yeah.

921
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
 That might be a plus.

922
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
 Yeah.

923
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,840
 And I think they said, uh, November was the, uh, the biggest decline in air travel to Las

924
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,040
 Vegas since they started, uh, keep checking those numbers.

925
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
 Yeah.

926
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
 No.

927
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
 That's rough.

928
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
 Yeah.

929
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 But I don't know.

930
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
 And the big picture thing is just a matter of it.

931
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,920
 Like we have, uh, we, with the sphere of the radar stadium, we have F one ourselves all

932
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
 the time.

933
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,840
 It was basically like when, when, when the whole, uh, when the whole town is taken up

934
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,840
 by one event that really hurts these side endeavors, because now it's whether the crowd

935
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,240
 that's going to that one event also likes this.

936
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,680
 So does everyone going to see the wizard of Oz also want to see rock vault?

937
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
 I don't know.

938
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,480
 So then it's not that weekend that weekends out for rock vault, right?

939
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,680
 Like it's just a, it's just a weird thing.

940
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,120
 Uh, and I guess we also just say that we also are speaking from entertainers perspectives.

941
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
 Like we're, we're, we're pro entertainment.

942
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
 Of course.

943
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,900
 Um, because like, uh, uh, Leon brings up Macau and Macau has never been an entertainment

944
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,900
 space.

945
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,400
 It's always just been a gambling space that shows the shows, the shows in McAlvin of Torsi

946
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
 done terribly.

947
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,200
 Um, even way back in the Dragoon's company, they, they had a show over there for a long

948
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,400
 time that was spectacular.

949
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,400
 I mean, they, they had a, uh, I forget what the name of the show was, but it was, it was

950
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
 such a great show.

951
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,520
 I knew a lot of people in it, uh, just, just hella talented people over there.

952
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,360
 And boy, they just could not, they couldn't pay people to come watch that show.

953
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,120
 And it was like a, a job, it was basically a giant Cirque du Soleil show.

954
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,840
 Uh, it was super impressive and they just couldn't get butts in the seats.

955
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,680
 No, and it'd be more gambling beyond that.

956
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
 Yeah.

957
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,120
 Beyond that, it was, uh, even the restaurants were doing well.

958
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,960
 Uh, it was the food court, the food, if you were, if you opened up a spot in the food

959
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,080
 court, you're making money hand over fist because that's what the gamblers could go

960
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,840
 there quickly, get food and come back or have some of the food court, bring the tape, bring

961
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,320
 it over to their, uh, bring it over to the table and eat at the table, get the food runners

962
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
 going.

963
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
 Yeah.

964
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,600
 Uh, which is still, it's a little different than, than here, but we'll see.

965
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,760
 I mean, the truth is that like, um, uh, tourism is down all over the place, you know, and

966
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,040
 that's because people below a certain class are experiencing a recession.

967
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,000
 People above a certain class are, are not, and, um, and so it's, it's a, it's a weird

968
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 time.

969
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,440
 Uh, it's a great time for the rich to get richer, which is like, thank God, cause I'm

970
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,560
 really as a, as a low end podcast, I'm ready to make a move, you know, but, um, I gotta

971
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,480
 shift these $10 around.

972
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,500
 Oh, this is a good time to bring up our scientific study.

973
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,640
 Give each of us a billion dollars and we're going to see if we can do better.

974
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,920
 I knew better than the current billionaires.

975
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,960
 I think we really, really could.

976
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,440
 I really, I really believe in me.

977
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
 I think we could do it.

978
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,680
 I, I'm, I'm very optimistic about us.

979
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,640
 I've, I've, uh, uh, you know, it's funny is like, uh, what comes to like something does

980
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,720
 come to mind for me when I, when I do hear that, uh, basically Tony Shade's vision for

981
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,020
 all the downtown motels, uh, you know, that's all going away, right?

982
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,320
 They're about to demolish all those motels, but I really think there's a way to revitalize

983
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,840
 like a small downtown motel areas to do like really cool, distinct things with each motel

984
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,320
 to make it much more of like a kitschy place to come visit bar crawl and like, and spend

985
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,720
 some time and be away from resort fees and things like that.

986
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,820
 Um, but, um, so there you go.

987
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,320
 So that's plan a for my billion dollars is, uh, is, uh, pick up Tony Shade.

988
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,760
 We're Tony Shade left off with the downtown motel.

989
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
 Be a hotelier.

990
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
 Yeah.

991
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
 I think it'd be fun.

992
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
 I think so.

993
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,080
 Uh, you know, who else I think would be fun to, uh, have them die and then take over their

994
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
 dream.

995
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
 Yes.

996
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
 And that would be the following sponsor.

997
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,920
 Today's show is brought to you by a compilation narrated by Jeffrey Jones.

998
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,640
 If it's okay, if this is too dark to air, but it's a long shot.

999
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
 Wait.

1000
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
 Oh, sorry.

1001
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,640
 I don't know if I understand this joke.

1002
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
 I don't get it.

1003
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
 I do.

1004
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
 I do.

1005
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
 Is this too dark to do?

1006
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,080
 Well, Bob crane was the star of Hogan's heroes and infamously a porn fanatic and made his

1007
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,800
 own porn.

1008
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,840
 And uh, Jeffrey Jones is the principal from Ferris Bueller and the dad from Beetlejuice.

1009
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
 Oh, okay.

1010
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,640
 Been outed as a nefarious, uh, child.

1011
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
 Yeah.

1012
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
 Yeah.

1013
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
 And bad guy.

1014
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,160
 Uh, they won't move along.

1015
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,760
 So yeah, we'll, we'll, I mean, it's a funny idea.

1016
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
 Yeah.

1017
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,680
 I don't know that I can execute it eloquently enough to make it funny and not.

1018
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
 That's it.

1019
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
 It's, it's, it's, it's all right.

1020
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,160
 Hey, scoops at checkout.

1021
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
 Fair.

1022
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:10,640
 Today's show is brought to you by PTSD is Barnum and Bailey's all veteran circus equally

1023
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
 dark.

1024
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:18,160
 What was that?

1025
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,320
 It's the circus.

1026
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
 It's here.

1027
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,880
 Stay very quiet.

1028
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,460
 Don't get out of the ring.

1029
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,040
 Never get out of the ring.

1030
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:40,120
 Barnum and Bailey's PTSD circus is here to entertain you quietly.

1031
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,840
 We guarantee no explosions, no animals.

1032
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,240
 Nothing exciting or scary will happen in the PTSD circus.

1033
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,960
 It's just clowns with no face paint falling.

1034
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
 That's it.

1035
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,140
 They just fall.

1036
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,880
 They just walk out onto the stage, fall down and they get, they get back up and they say,

1037
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
 speak.

1038
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,760
 They say, Hey, I'm okay.

1039
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,400
 So you remember when you lost that good friend in Da Nang, he went down.

1040
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,360
 He never got back up.

1041
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,680
 These clowns, they're going to stand up again and they're going to look you in the face

1042
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,960
 and say, Hey, I'm all right.

1043
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
 It's okay.

1044
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,960
 We can go home together.

1045
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,280
 No, no, that's too much.

1046
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
 That's too much.

1047
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,480
 Letting people off.

1048
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,320
 Calm it down.

1049
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,000
 Never leave the ring.

1050
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,540
 Never get out of the ring.

1051
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,440
 That's pretty dark, but not as dark.

1052
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
 I don't know.

1053
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
 Maybe not as dark.

1054
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
 I don't know.

1055
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
 I don't have PTSD from war.

1056
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
 Thank God.

1057
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
 It or hate scoops of checkout.

1058
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
 I guess.

1059
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
 Let's do a little Scoop Mail.

1060
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
 Physical Scoop Mail.

1061
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,440
 Physical Scoop Mail.

1062
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
 Zip-a-dee-doo.

1063
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
 We got mail in a box.

1064
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
 I love it.

1065
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
 We love it.

1066
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
 We got mail in a box.

1067
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,720
 Zip-a-dee-doo, we got mail in a box.

1068
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,720
 I love it.

1069
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
 We love it.

1070
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,720
 We got all our holiday cards here.

1071
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
 Happy New Year, everybody.

1072
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
 Message for you, son.

1073
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
 Oh, oh.

1074
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,720
 While we're in Scoop Mail, shout out to Craig Ruth, who just went up to the, went from the

1075
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,320
 low tier to the $20 tier for the year on Patreon.

1076
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
 Oh, awesome.

1077
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
 Hell yeah, Craig.

1078
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
 Thank you so much, Craig.

1079
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
 Thank you, brother.

1080
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
 Yeah.

1081
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
 Thank you, Craig.

1082
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,880
 We got one here from the Mass Hole Scoop, Happiest Holidays.

1083
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,600
 We love getting the card from the Mass Hole Scoop there.

1084
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
 These are great.

1085
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,080
 I love getting these.

1086
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,360
 The Maynards.

1087
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,960
 We got a great-looking family here, Season's Greetings.

1088
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,200
 We got a dog with possibly a Hawaiian lei or something like that around its neck.

1089
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
 I like it.

1090
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
 Whatever it is.

1091
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
 That's adorable.

1092
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
 I'm a fan of it.

1093
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,800
 That's from Frozen Cusser.

1094
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
 Let's see here.

1095
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,280
 Merry crisposh to you and the guys in the churn and to your families, oh yeah.

1096
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
 Thank you.

1097
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
 So nice.

1098
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,360
 This is from, oh, that's from the Maple Raisin Scoop.

1099
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
 Very nice.

1100
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,360
 Let me see if I can get it on the camera.

1101
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
 There we go.

1102
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
 Kinda.

1103
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,360
 There we go.

1104
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,360
 Good.

1105
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
 We did.

1106
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,360
 We got a lot of crisposh cards this year.

1107
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
 We got, oh, I like this one.

1108
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
 Peas on Earth.

1109
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,360
 Peas on Earth.

1110
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
 It's caroling peas.

1111
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
 Cute.

1112
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
 Very nice.

1113
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,320
 Oh, that's from Tess, the Slightly Slutty Scoop.

1114
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,000
 Sitting you and yours, the very best for the holiday season, thanks for all you do for

1115
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,360
 this amazing community, wishing you a merry crisposh.

1116
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
 Thank you, Tess.

1117
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,480
 What were you saying, Matt?

1118
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,520
 Oh, just a lot of iron content in that, in the peas chorus, a lot of good iron.

1119
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,960
 Oh, yes.

1120
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:50,760
 Peas chorus hot, peas chorus cold, peas standing on your doorstep singing songs of old.

1121
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,780
 We got one here from the Nielsen family.

1122
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,780
 Love that.

1123
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,780
 Very cute.

1124
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,280
 Matt and Jacob Paul got his on his own.

1125
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,000
 We wish you a sweltering and sweaty quick crisposh.

1126
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 We do have that.

1127
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,720
 May the new year be lucrative and sexy like your wives fucking you in the face.

1128
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
 That's the Nielsen's.

1129
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,720
 Hell yeah.

1130
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,720
 And their pets.

1131
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:22,320
 Well, we got a great one from LAJ, from the big twisty road in San Francisco.

1132
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
 Thanks LAJ.

1133
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,320
 That's a cool looking print, man.

1134
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
 All the best for 2026.

1135
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,840
 Hope you're doing good, LAJ.

1136
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
 Yes.

1137
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,080
 Let's see, we got one here.

1138
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:39,160
 There is a Snow Bucks coffee and let's see, we got a snowman has ordered a hot coffee

1139
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,200
 and he is back at the counter wanting to exchange it for an iced coffee because it has melted

1140
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,880
 the front of his face completely off.

1141
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,800
 Wishing you the best holiday season, merry crisposh.

1142
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:03,640
 Wait, maybe despite being T DeVore, have we not been saying your name?

1143
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,640
 I don't know.

1144
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,520
 You also didn't put your name in this card.

1145
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,960
 You said, I haven't been saying your name as a Patreon member, but then you didn't sign

1146
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,240
 your name in the card.

1147
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,560
 So I'm looking at the return address, T DeVore.

1148
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,320
 If we haven't been saying your name, maybe it's because you haven't given me your name.

1149
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,320
 That's Travis.

1150
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,320
 Oh, Travis.

1151
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,720
 Have we not been saying your name?

1152
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,840
 Well, let's make sure we get that.

1153
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,480
 I got to look at the list here.

1154
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
 Travis, we're sorry.

1155
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,480
 How is that possible?

1156
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,840
 We have a list that downloads from the site.

1157
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,960
 I don't know.

1158
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
 It's annoying.

1159
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,160
 I'm going to tell all the listeners right now.

1160
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,440
 All you Patreon supporters out there and anybody that's ever been a Patreon supporter of us

1161
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,680
 and anyone that ever might be a Patreon supporter of us, when you tell us something is wrong

1162
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:50,280
 with Patreon, 85% of the time, we are as confused as you are.

1163
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,280
 15% of the time, we fucked it up, but 85% of the time, we are just confused.

1164
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,280
 Yeah.

1165
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,920
 I was doing the newsletter again, and that newsletter format is bunk.

1166
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,920
 It's bunkaroo, but I have to use it to include enough images.

1167
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,200
 I don't know.

1168
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,200
 It's weird.

1169
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,200
 Right.

1170
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:17,840
 This stuff is not at all conducive to anything, but Travis, thank you for the card, and we'll

1171
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,080
 try and make sure we get you on the list.

1172
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,080
 We got this one.

1173
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,280
 This is a great one here.

1174
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,240
 Much love to you and everything you do.

1175
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,240
 Luke, Angie, Pierce, and Frank.

1176
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,000
 It is a great, a great Chris Bosh card.

1177
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Their card.

1178
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 There.

1179
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 I got one of their cards too.

1180
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,120
 That was an amazing Christmas Chris Bosh card this year from them.

1181
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
 The Andersons.

1182
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,120
 I love the Andersons.

1183
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,120
 They sent us a great Chris Bosh card as well.

1184
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,400
 And the Drabillises.

1185
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,200
 We got one from the Drabillises, so Amy and Carl and kids.

1186
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,280
 And they got them next to the Dippin' Dots on the back, right?

1187
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,280
 Oh yeah.

1188
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,400
 They're standing next to the Dippin' Dots stand.

1189
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,400
 Yeah, I love that.

1190
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,520
 Jake, did you talk about how SJ is playing New Year's Eve tonight over at the Virgin?

1191
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,520
 I haven't yet.

1192
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:11,200
 Yeah, she's over at the, well she's at Jason Aldean's bar at the City Center first.

1193
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,040
 And then the Spice wannabe show, the Spice Girls show, they are playing at the Hard Rock

1194
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,240
 on the Strip tonight.

1195
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 That's pretty impressive.

1196
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
 Oh yeah.

1197
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 That's a big deal.

1198
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
 Yeah, they're booked there.

1199
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,320
 I think I'm going to run over and see at least the second half of the show.

1200
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,240
 I think it's going to be great.

1201
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,800
 That's going to be a good get.

1202
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,520
 It's going to be a big, big get.

1203
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
 Yeah, I think so.

1204
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,240
 They've got a lot of tour dates and everything this year.

1205
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,600
 I think they've got some new dates coming up here.

1206
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,120
 It's going to be good.

1207
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,120
 It's a great show.

1208
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
 It is.

1209
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
 It is.

1210
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
 They work super hard on it.

1211
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,120
 Let's do a little jock versus a nerd.

1212
00:50:46,120 --> 00:51:05,880
 I always say Amy and Carl's last name wrong, Rory is fussing at me in the chat about saying

1213
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,640
 their last name wrong.

1214
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,640
 I always say her wrong.

1215
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,640
 Explosion of people saying last names wrong.

1216
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,640
 Well, part of it is I hear it said.

1217
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,640
 It's one of these things.

1218
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,200
 I hear the name said and I can say it.

1219
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,000
 But then when I see it written out, it fucks me up again.

1220
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,920
 I can't see it written out and say it.

1221
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
 Yes.

1222
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,360
 Anyway, we've got a scooper coming to us today from lemur screamer creamer.

1223
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:39,720
 The categories are animals in camo sounds the same mommy and milk dance with the cane.

1224
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
 The categories dance.

1225
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,720
 Yeah.

1226
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,720
 Categories dance.

1227
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
 Categories dance.

1228
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
 Matt, you're up first.

1229
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,600
 What you want animals in camo animals in camo for 400.

1230
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,440
 The jackpot reached a million dollars.

1231
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:01,240
 What animals and animals in camo again, there's an animal in here.

1232
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
 Oh, I see.

1233
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:08,400
 Oh, this has become like a real gentleman's created a monster here.

1234
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
 I see it.

1235
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
 I found it.

1236
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,240
 It's just in one word.

1237
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,560
 Okay, doll doll jack, the infamous doll.

1238
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,440
 Don't go near the doll enclosure.

1239
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
 It'll bite your fucking face off.

1240
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,400
 Actually I've worked in the doll enclosure at the haunted museum.

1241
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,400
 What can I say?

1242
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,040
 That's what happened to Paul's face.

1243
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
 That's what happened.

1244
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,040
 Peggy got me.

1245
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,040
 Oh, lion.

1246
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:44,020
 There it is lion and a million lion, lion, a million.

1247
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,020
 You lie.

1248
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:51,040
 I'll do sounds the same for 400, a bucket lacking color.

1249
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,740
 Oh, I, a pale, a pale.

1250
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,740
 It sounds the same.

1251
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,740
 Yeah.

1252
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,740
 It sounds the same.

1253
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:10,120
 Paul, I will go with, sounds the same for eight, please.

1254
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,280
 All right.

1255
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,560
 A type of tree and by the seashore.

1256
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,960
 A type of tree by the seashore.

1257
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:29,000
 Oh, a beach, beach tree, beach nut, beach tree.

1258
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,680
 Yeah, absolutely.

1259
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:36,160
 I did not know that a beach tree and a ocean beach were not spelled the same.

1260
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,520
 I'm just learning that right now.

1261
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,720
 Only way I know it is because of all the baby food that beach nut, B-E-E-C-H.

1262
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,960
 Oh, Paul loves his baby food.

1263
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
 Yeah.

1264
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,800
 I mean, I just unload fuck tons of it every week, that's all.

1265
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
 I see it going through.

1266
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,280
 Put it right into a package for Jeffrey Jones and then mail it off.

1267
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,620
 Oh, Rose, Rose, Matt, you're up.

1268
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,760
 Dude, sounds the same for 1200, I would probably be doing a lot better if I was eating just

1269
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:16,120
 baby food, daily double, a corridor or to drag card cargo hallway, all the way.

1270
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,960
 Oh, a hall.

1271
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,960
 Yeah.

1272
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
 Sure.

1273
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,560
 Yeah, hall and hall.

1274
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:30,120
 That's what Darryl Oates fears the most dueling holes and what is the status of their lawsuit?

1275
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,760
 They were in a nasty lawsuit for.

1276
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,020
 They are still very acrimonious.

1277
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,160
 They still hate each other.

1278
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:46,480
 The one guy bit the other guy, no, no, allegedly, no, uh, Hall is just like, Hall is just like,

1279
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,160
 I just want to be Darryl Hall and Oates is, but, but me, but you need the Oates.

1280
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,080
 Oh, the lawsuit ended in August of 2025, Darryl Hall voluntarily dismissed his legal action

1281
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,740
 against John Oates following private arbitration that resolved their disputes over Oates attempts

1282
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:07,000
 to shell, to share or to sell his share.

1283
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,400
 That's their greatest hits album.

1284
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,800
 It's called private arbitration.

1285
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
 Yeah.

1286
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,120
 So apparently Hall dismissed the lawsuit against Oates.

1287
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:23,040
 Private arbitration is how we settle our differences, me and Darryl Hall get along again.

1288
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,040
 Private arbitration.

1289
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
 Yup.

1290
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,040
 Clap, clap.

1291
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,240
 I'm still mad at them for writing man eaters.

1292
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,240
 So I don't care.

1293
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
 Uh, I'll try.

1294
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,960
 Sounds the same for 200, 2000.

1295
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,960
 Writing man eater.

1296
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,340
 I'm still mad at them about man eater.

1297
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,760
 So, uh, fuck them.

1298
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,920
 Permitted or in a whisper.

1299
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,920
 In a whisper.

1300
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
 In a whisper.

1301
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:50,720
 Don't you know talking about a revolution permitted in a whisper.

1302
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,840
 I'm not trying to give you a hint, Jacob.

1303
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,640
 I'm just doing a Tracy Chapman reference.

1304
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
 No, no, no.

1305
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,640
 I caught that.

1306
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,640
 I caught that.

1307
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:11,440
 You weren't helping there, uh, permitted or in a whisper.

1308
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,920
 Is this allowed?

1309
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,920
 That's what I'm thinking.

1310
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
 Yeah.

1311
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,280
 But in a, in a whisper is confusing on.

1312
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,280
 Yeah.

1313
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,360
 But I mean, it's, it's, you know, instead of, yeah, instead of silently.

1314
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
 I guess so.

1315
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
 I guess.

1316
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,360
 Yeah.

1317
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,360
 I'll try that.

1318
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,360
 Allowed and allowed.

1319
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,360
 Yeah.

1320
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,360
 There we go.

1321
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,360
 There it is.

1322
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
 In a whisper.

1323
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
 Uh, Paul.

1324
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
 He is a Wafartian.

1325
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,080
 Uh, I'll do mommy for 400.

1326
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,080
 Daily double.

1327
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
 Mommy.

1328
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,080
 Mommy.

1329
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,080
 Mommy.

1330
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,080
 Mommy.

1331
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:48,120
 The Catholic nun won the Nobel peace prize in 1979, Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa.

1332
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,120
 That's right.

1333
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,120
 Mommy.

1334
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,120
 Matt.

1335
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,120
 You're up.

1336
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,720
 Um, I'll do, uh, what an undeserving bitch.

1337
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,720
 800.

1338
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,120
 She's a total shit.

1339
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,640
 Bracelets were handed out at the carnival.

1340
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,320
 The prize bracelets were handed out at the carnival.

1341
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,320
 Zebra.

1342
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,320
 Zebra.

1343
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,560
 Zebra.

1344
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,560
 It is zebra.

1345
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
 Yeah.

1346
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,560
 Zebra.

1347
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,560
 It's me.

1348
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,560
 I'll try.

1349
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
 Man.

1350
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,000
 You guys are so much better at that animal one than I am.

1351
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,040
 I'm going to try milk for 400.

1352
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,040
 Milk.

1353
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,040
 Milk.

1354
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040
 Milk.

1355
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:33,080
 Pecorano Romano cheese comes from this animal.

1356
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,800
 Is it not a cow?

1357
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,800
 It's a mouse.

1358
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,480
 Probably not.

1359
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
 Is it a goat cheese?

1360
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
 The tit milk of mouse.

1361
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
 Pecorano Romano.

1362
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,480
 Pecorino.

1363
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
 Maybe it's a sheep.

1364
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
 Pecorino.

1365
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
 Maybe it's a sheep.

1366
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
 Could be.

1367
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:55,400
 Uh, or is this one of those, uh, like you, you get a cheese from the, uh, from all the

1368
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,120
 lady bacterias that are down in the lady bits.

1369
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,320
 It's, uh, it's Pecorino Romano from under cheese.

1370
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,480
 Is it from under cheese, lady bit cheese from under cheese.

1371
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,760
 That's why I don't eat that Pecorino Romano.

1372
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,320
 Uh, I guess I'll pass.

1373
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
 Paul.

1374
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,480
 Hey, uh, give me some of that from under.

1375
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,600
 Um, I'll have a smear of that on my bagel, please.

1376
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,880
 Oh, here you go, Pecorino.

1377
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,160
 Oh, my brother is huge and wants to fuck my wife.

1378
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,600
 Um, I pass.

1379
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,400
 Uh, Matt.

1380
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,760
 Pass.

1381
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,320
 It's sheep.

1382
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
 It's sheep.

1383
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,320
 It's a sheep cheese.

1384
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,320
 Sheep.

1385
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
 Sheep shenanigans.

1386
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,600
 Um, I'll go on with mommy, please.

1387
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,920
 Mommy, this board where electronics are mounted.

1388
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,200
 That's a motherboard.

1389
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,880
 That's a motherboard right there.

1390
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,160
 That's a motherboard.

1391
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,960
 Get down on it.

1392
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,000
 Get down on it.

1393
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,080
 I want to do animals and camo for 2000.

1394
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,560
 The simple mural brightened the whole space.

1395
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,560
 Lemur.

1396
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,560
 Lemur.

1397
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,560
 Yeah.

1398
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,560
 Wow.

1399
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,560
 Nice.

1400
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,560
 Good job.

1401
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
 That's me.

1402
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,560
 I'll try.

1403
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
 Um, I don't know.

1404
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,560
 Fuck that animals and camo bullshit.

1405
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
 Mommy.

1406
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,560
 1200.

1407
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:28,160
 Uh, however the fuck you say her first name, Daenerys Targaryen.

1408
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,480
 Yeah.

1409
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,760
 And I believe that is the mother of dragons.

1410
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,760
 Yeah.

1411
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,760
 Yeah.

1412
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,760
 Mother of dragons.

1413
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,760
 Yeah.

1414
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
 Mother.

1415
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,960
 Are you the mother of the dragons, girl?

1416
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,200
 Do you want to take over?

1417
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,160
 Oh, mother.

1418
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,520
 Father.

1419
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,560
 Uh, mommy, please.

1420
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,200
 Do you want to see dragons tonight?

1421
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,200
 Chris Jenner.

1422
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,920
 She is the mother of the Kardashians.

1423
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,120
 Also known as the hell mouth beast Satan herself.

1424
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,120
 The momager.

1425
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,720
 Oh, the momager, the momager, she's the manager and mom.

1426
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,720
 Yeah.

1427
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,680
 I'm glad I don't know that as much Kardashian shit as I've seen, fucker.

1428
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,480
 Well, then I don't feel bad about you getting there.

1429
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,480
 No, no, no.

1430
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,480
 She's trash.

1431
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
 Matt, you're up.

1432
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
 They're all trash.

1433
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,520
 Uh, see, I like animals and camo because you have to know stuff, just to see stuff.

1434
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,520
 Right.

1435
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,520
 Yeah.

1436
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,200
 Animals and camo for 1200.

1437
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,000
 The hijack almost succeeded.

1438
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,920
 The hijack almost succeeded.

1439
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,840
 Oh, wow.

1440
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
 It's a Jackalmo.

1441
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
 All right.

1442
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,840
 Big talk about animals and camo.

1443
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,840
 I'm a second ago.

1444
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
 Jackalmo.

1445
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
 Jackalmo.

1446
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
 Jackalmo.

1447
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
 Jackalmo.

1448
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,840
 Jackalmo.

1449
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,840
 Jackalmo.

1450
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,840
 Jackalmo.

1451
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,840
 Jackalmo.

1452
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
 Jackalmo.

1453
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,840
 Jackalmo.

1454
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
 Jackalmo.

1455
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
 Jackalmo.

1456
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
 It's me.

1457
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
 I'm in second with 3600.

1458
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,840
 I'm in second with 3600.

1459
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,480
 Paul is in third with 400.

1460
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,920
 There are no daily doubles left.

1461
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,440
 There are three questions left and they're all about milk.

1462
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
 Mm, mm, milk.

1463
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,440
 Oh, let's see.

1464
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,240
 I have 2000 points and behind Matt, I guess I'll take milk for 2000.

1465
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,960
 What animal produces the most expensive milk in the world?

1466
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,960
 Cats.

1467
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,960
 Your mom.

1468
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,160
 By ounce?

1469
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,680
 My guess?

1470
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,960
 I like that I have a clarifying question to a question I have no idea.

1471
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,960
 Sure.

1472
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,760
 But let's measure it by ounce.

1473
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,200
 I'm fine with that.

1474
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,200
 Let's see.

1475
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,200
 Whale.

1476
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:48,640
 Someone wrote in the chat, human, which is like, buddy, go on Craigslist, I'll tell you

1477
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
 right now.

1478
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,640
 Human milk is not--

1479
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,640
 You're overpaying for your human milk.

1480
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
 Not that expensive.

1481
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,480
 But is it more expensive than other mammals?

1482
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:01,480
 I don't know.

1483
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:07,320
 Like whale, whale milk, don't platypuses, don't they have a nipple?

1484
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,320
 Don't they do milk?

1485
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,200
 They cut themselves as a very expensive milk.

1486
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
 Are they a mono-tream?

1487
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,480
 They're a mono-tream.

1488
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,480
 They are.

1489
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,480
 And they do produce milk.

1490
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,480
 Right.

1491
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,480
 I'll guess platypus.

1492
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,480
 All right.

1493
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,480
 A donkey.

1494
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,920
 A donkey.

1495
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,600
 Boy, that's one of those questions is that if you just don't know it, you just don't

1496
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,600
 know it.

1497
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,600
 Paul, you're up.

1498
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
 Who's donkey milk for?

1499
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,600
 Where's donkey milk popular?

1500
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,840
 Dan's the reason-- it's more commonly known as asqueezins.

1501
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,720
 And that's why you didn't recognize it.

1502
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,720
 Asqueezins are real--

1503
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,720
 Bam-a-lam.

1504
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,720
 I see.

1505
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,720
 I see.

1506
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,720
 Whoa, asqueezins.

1507
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
 Bam-a-lam.

1508
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,720
 Whoa, asqueezins.

1509
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,720
 Bam-a-lam.

1510
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,720
 I see.

1511
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,720
 He hauled that milk.

1512
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,720
 Bam-a-lam.

1513
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,720
 I'll go--

1514
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,720
 With smoothies and silk.

1515
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,720
 Bam-a-lam.

1516
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,720
 Ooh.

1517
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,720
 Asqueezins.

1518
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,720
 Donkey milk.

1519
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,160
 I'll go with milk for $1,200, please.

1520
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,360
 This animal's milk is popular in the Middle East and very salty.

1521
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,600
 Gotta be camel.

1522
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,720
 Gotta be camel milk, right?

1523
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,720
 Camel milk.

1524
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,720
 Yeah.

1525
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,720
 Camel milk.

1526
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,720
 Camel milk tea.

1527
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,720
 Camel milk.

1528
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,720
 Camel.

1529
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,720
 And Matt, close it out the category and the game.

1530
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,720
 He's got the win.

1531
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,160
 Madden is at least, Madden is leading, milk for $800.

1532
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,440
 The fattiest milk overall is from this animal.

1533
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,360
 Oh, so there's an animal hidden in this clue, right?

1534
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,060
 No, I think this one is the--

1535
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,060
 I think this is--

1536
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,060
 No, this is--

1537
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,060
 This is just milk.

1538
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,060
 It's just a question.

1539
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,060
 Oh, I'm sorry.

1540
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,060
 I'm just used to hunting for animals in the--

1541
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,060
 The blue whale?

1542
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,320
 I think this could be the blue whale.

1543
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,320
 The fattiest milk overall is from this animal.

1544
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,960
 Your mom, that ugly bitch, final answer.

1545
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,120
 There you go.

1546
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,120
 Pass.

1547
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,920
 Pass.

1548
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
 Paul.

1549
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,160
 No, sorry, me.

1550
01:03:53,160 --> 01:04:02,220
 Fattiest milk overall from this animal, elephants, seal, the hooded seal.

1551
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,680
 I have fat in my milk all day long.

1552
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,680
 That's the game.

1553
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,960
 Matt wins with $5,600.

1554
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,440
 Paul is in second with $1,600.

1555
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,880
 I'm in third with $800.

1556
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
 That's from lemur, screamer, creamer.

1557
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,880
 Gosh.

1558
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,880
 Thank you so much lemur, screamer, creamer.

1559
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
 If you want to--

1560
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,920
 Milk's a real blind spot in our household, huh?

1561
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920
 It really is.

01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,920
 Hey, this is not my time where we thank our latest people on air.

1572
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,280
 Did you send us a list, Jacob?

1573
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,280
 Right?

1574
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,280
 No, we--

1575
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,280
 I just sent it to you.

1576
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,280
 It's not a new month.

1577
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
 It's an old month.

1578
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,840
 It's still December when we're recording.

1579

 These people all would physically kiss the ass of a stranger to help all mankind.

1594
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,580

 Thank you so much!

1621
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,280
 Thank you so much.

1622
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:44,520
 If you want to be thanked on air or get all kinds of different rewards that we offer,

1623
01:08:44,520 --> 01:09:04,840
 head on over to PreachingFun.com and look at the tier that fits your budget today.

1624
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:09,000
 Or if you, like me, were a little upset that Howard Leese wasn't wearing his enormous knife

1625
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:23,080
 on his hip for the last show of Rock Vault, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1626
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:27,400
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with PreachingFun.com takes you over to our Patreon page where for

1627
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,660
 as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1628
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:36,500
 We are dependent on our Patreon supporters, so you are really helping keep this show truckin'.

1629
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:42,800
 If you like this show, if you think it's good, head over to PreachingFun.com, fartsinabag.biz.

1630
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,760
 Like I say, for as little as $3 a month, and you can do it yearly if you want to do that,

1631
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,760
 you can do your whole support for the year, you don't have to do it monthly if you don't

1632
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,960
 want to, and you get a bit of a discount if you want to do it for the year, if you want

1633
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,080
 to sign up for all of 26, you can do that.

1634
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,320
 You can do it month by month, that is perfectly fine.

1635
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:05,080
 And you can give gifts, you can give the gift of a Patreon subscription to someone that you

1636
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,960
 either love or hate, depending on how you think they will like this show.

1637
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,360
 You can give them the gift of us for all of 2026.

1638
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,360
 That's right.

1639
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,360
 All right.

1640
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,360
 Well, thanks for this, everybody.

1641
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,360
 Stay safe out there.

1642
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,360
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

1643
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,360
 Happy New Year, everybody.

1644
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,360
 Happy New Year.

1645
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,360
 Happy New Year.

1646
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,360
 We need to go over our big resolutions.

1647
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,360
 This is a big deal.

1648
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,360
 Oh, yeah.

1649
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,360
 Any quick ones?

1650
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,360
 Resolution speed around.

1651
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:35,360
 Spanish.

1652
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:44,340
 Oh, 1080p.

1653
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:50,120
 Eat better after 10 p.m.

1654
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,680
 I'm clearly going to have the highest resolution.

1655
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,680
 I think so.

1656
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,680
 1080p is pretty high.

1657
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,680
 It is pretty high.

1658
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,680
 It's pretty high.

1659
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,680
 None of us wants.

1660
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
 None of us want to see us in 4K.

1661
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,680
 No, no, no.

1662
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
 That's why I didn't go there.

1663
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680
 Who's watching movies for nose hairs?

1664
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,680
 I mean, come on.

1665
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,680
 We are not made for high def.

1666
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,680
 What are we doing?

1667
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,680
 Pop the box.

1668
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,680
 Every time I see like, you know, they take the old footage and upgrade it and make it

1669
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,680
 all high def and everything.

1670
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,680
 I'm like, oh, you were, you were just hurting these performers who never thought they would

1671
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,680
 be seeing this clearly.

1672
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,680
 There is something to that 30 FPS.

1673
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,680
 Great.

1674
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:37,640
 Film quality that makes it so much more theatrical, like fairy tale, dreamlike, it removes it

1675
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,640
 from reality.

1676
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,400
 It looks like a movie and I mean, maybe it's what was raised on, but it looks like a movie.

1677
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,080
 When I see that smoothing and all that shit, I'm just like, get that the fuck out.

1678
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,800
 I'm watching the neutron.

1679
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,720
 I just get, I just get so hard to see all that smoothed out skin.

1680
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
 Half of it.

1681
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
 So hard.

1682
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,880
 But half of the neutron looks like a goddamn soap opera set.

1683
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,520
 I'm like, what the fuck?

1684
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,840
 Why would you do this to your billion dollar show?

1685
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,600
 I don't love you everybody.
