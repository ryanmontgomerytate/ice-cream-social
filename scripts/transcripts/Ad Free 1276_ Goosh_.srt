1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh, hello there. I am so happy you're here. I want to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers? Well, these are the folks that deliver that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 It's a new month. We don't have a new list yet, so I don't have names to thank.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But we will thank each and every ice cream truck driver before this month is through.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver and help deliver that ice cream, head over to PreachingFun.com.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 PreachingFun.com is where you can go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And who knows? The life you save may be your own.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Here's the show. Woo.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Great. Let's go.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Suck on a Capri Sun.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Oh, no, I'm a Kool-Aid Jammers guy.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Oh, Kool-Aid Jammer. Those give me a little strange agitator.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 They give me the agitator. I just had a boxing juju.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Time for Matt Madison's ice cream social. Soon to be in intestinal distress. That's Paul Mattingly.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Come on.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Sitting over there with his Kool-Aid. That's Matt Donnelly.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I'm here. I'm Jacob. It's PreachingFun.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'm here and I'm Jacob.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I'm here and I'm Jacob.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Happy New Year, gents.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Happy New Year.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I tried very hard to go see my wife on New Year's Eve at one of her gigs and failed so miserably.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 What happened?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 It was terrible.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 What happened?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It was terrible. I had the early show at Absinthe over at Caesar's Palace.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I got done at 10.30 PM. My wife was less than a mile down the road doing a gig with several of our other friends,

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 several other close friends. Some of them have been on the podcast from the Spice Girls show that she does.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So I was going to go down, see part of her show, hang out with her, hang out with our friends on New Year's Eve,

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 ring in the New Year. It was going to be great. Well, my plan was to walk.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 No, no.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And then it was, well, I was like, oh, it'll take me a half hour to walk down there, but that's not a big deal.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I wasn't too worried about the walk.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Normally.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Normally, normally. Well, no, even with the foot traffic, I was like, it'll take me a half hour, maybe 40, 45 minutes.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 But even then, that's okay. I'm not worried about that. It was raining a little bit.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It was raining.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It was raining beautiful weather for two weeks and then New Year's Eve.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It was raining, by the way, did not seem to affect Las Vegas tourism negatively at all.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 The earlier reports I saw actually were that it was a record record numbers for New Year's Eve.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's right. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. Even record numbers of trash.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Twelve tons of trash cleaned up on the strip after it was all over.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Jacob, how did your mom get down to this trip?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I'm not twelve tons of trash. I'm Jacob's mom.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Yeah. Well, you keep eating them pies, you're going to be 13 tons of trash.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I know that my mom listens to the podcast. Hi, mom.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 13 tons of trash.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So I walk outside after the show. I gotta go drop off my bag and everything in the car.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 So I go over and drop everything off and it's sprinkling rain a little bit.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I'm like, you know what? This might help me out.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 This might be a glass half full moment because this means that nobody else

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 or not as many other people are going to be out on the actual street.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Way to silver lining it, Jacob. That's really good.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's going to clear the path for me.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Did you think about using your scooter?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I thought about using the scooter, but then I would have had to park the scooter somewhere.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Also, the scooter, when it is wet at all, is a death trap.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I guess that's true.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Yeah. It is horrible to ride that thing if it is slightly wet.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Oh, God.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Because it's just not heavy enough. It doesn't stay on the ground well enough.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So I go outside.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 No, your mom's on it. Yeah.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Put down the pie, mom.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Boom, boom, boom. The hits keep coming.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Boom, boom, boom. It's my mom walking down the hall.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So I walk outside. I'm like, OK, it's misting rain a little bit.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I'll be a little damp. That's OK.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I won't be soaking wet or anything. This is doable.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I'll be all right.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So I start walking down the street. I'm out on the strip.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It's great. It's New Year's Eve on the Las Vegas strip.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It's all that stuff. It's all the people watching that goes along with that.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Dreams, a lot of dreams in the air, a lot of hopes, a lot of hopes and dreams.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 A lot of deflated pornographic dreams floating through the ether.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And then it started raining a little bit harder.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Call that 696969 number in 2026.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I'm going to get a hold of that dead billboard lady.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I'm going to see what that's all about.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Hey, which one of them is dead?

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 All of them send her to six for the Rio, please.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I was talking to my friend who's a Uber driver.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 He's talking about how many how many tourists come to town

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 and they take the Uber to massage parlors and go like, oh, I guess.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Oh, I don't know if this is the place or, you know, it's like song and dance.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 They try to alibi it like about like, oh, I guess I'll get out here and figure it out.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 But, you know, I don't just like I do any time I'm getting dropped off by an Uber

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 at a place that I don't think is my destination.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I choose to go ahead and get out and figure it out when in Rome.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 How many I guess most massage parlors in Vegas are connected to human trafficking in some way?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 How dare you? How dare you?

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 They're legit foot tension specialists brought here.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 You leave massage envy alone.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I very much do.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 They recruit the top graduates of all the leading reflexology schools.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Is that reflexology school in a giant shipping container?

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Because I wouldn't call it a giant shipping container.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Look, you say accredited, I say seaworthy.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 These are maritime degrees, maritime degrees that are given out.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Maritime degrees?

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Burn your diploma at sea. You can get your diploma at sea.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I just came here to get a manicure, but sure, I'll stick around.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Stick around forever.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Oh no.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Now you're in a shipping container.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Shit. It's not even a giant one. It's a regular size one.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I should do a Bernie Sanders.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It's misting a little bit and then it's no longer misting.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Now it's lightly raining.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 There's more water coming from the sky now.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I know this because I had a gig and I drove to Utah, no problem.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Did the show and then drove back trying to make it back to this party

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 in time to be with my kids and stuff.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The rain between 10 and midnight was pretty heavy.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Yeah.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It was a record rainfall for Las Vegas,

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 which is kind of like having the highest rated show on CW.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Really, what are we talking about?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 But we had record rainfall.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 We did.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I finally gave up.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I basically walked from one end of Caesar's Palace to the other outside.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Don't mind me, guys.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I'm just drinking our Christmas gift from Soundstack, our hosting company.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 They didn't send three months, just one.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 We're going to pass that around.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It's going to be a travel.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Let me look at that.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Is that their emblem?

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Paul can have it in January, Jacob in February.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 No, I want it on Wednesdays and Fridays.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 We'll ship it that often.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Yeah.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It looks like three styles of circumcision.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 That's right.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 That's what they started off as.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It's much like the Kraft food company.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 It started off as a little niche industry and grew and grew and grew.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 That's right.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 That's right.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 So I walked from one end of Caesar's to the other.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I watched Matt take a drink out of that, and I said, "Matt, is that coffee in that mug?"

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He said, "Moil less."

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 All right, we last left off.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Jacob was soaking wet.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Sorry.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 You're getting soaking wet.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 But Jacob, did you take the advice of the MythBusters and just stroll calmly and serenely

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 through the rain, or did you try to run?

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I stroll.

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I have a stroller.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 You were shoving people at the right goal, like, "It's raining," and just shoving everyone.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It's raining.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Oh, my God, it's raining.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I'm going to melt.

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I threw my fists out in front of me and just flailed them around and ran, yelling, "It's

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 raining!"

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Forearm elbow sweeping, just the whole...

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Yeah.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Jeff, in the chat, is asking a very valid question.

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 "Do people even own raincoats or umbrellas in Vegas?"

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I don't know if people do, but I know that I do not.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I never did.

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I keep them in the trunk of my car.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 You do?

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Uh-huh.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I do.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Who are you?

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Because you're a Jersey.

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I need to get an umbrella and just keep it in my car.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 That's it.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 It's your old Jersey habits.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Which I definitely used to do.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I never did growing up in Kentucky.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I'm just following off on it.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 We didn't get that much rain in Kentucky.

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 No, I was...

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Living in New York was always the funniest thing, because they sell umbrellas at all the

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 little bodega shops, and they're always like three or four bucks.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Then all of a sudden it starts raining, and they're $10 to $15, and they just price search

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 umbrellas all the time.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 But yeah, that's what I was going to ask.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 If you have a utility umbrella, even at work, I thought maybe you might keep one.

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Someone might have one at a desk or an office.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 We keep a pile of them at work, but they stay there.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Those are...

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 They're decorative.

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Those are just the ones.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 They're a bouquet of umbrellas.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Some people have stuffed animal heads on their walls.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 We have umbrellas.

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 I've seen the umbrellas employed at Absinthe during inclement times when people have to

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 be ferried from stage to tent and what have you, back and forth.

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Stagehands have gone out.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 We have giant golf umbrellas to get cast members through wet areas and everything if we have to.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Big Sexy actually makes a really good point.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 The reason why we have umbrellas handy is not because I'm always thinking about the rain.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's because my kids play outdoor sports and you use an umbrella in the desert just to give yourself shade.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So what kind of umbrella?

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Is it a black umbrella?

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Is it a...

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 We have multiple.

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 We have a super wide golf umbrella for keeping two of us under the shade watching sports.

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Color.

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Blue and white striped.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Then I have tiny maroon umbrellas that I have for just in case for rain or an extra kid in tow or whatever.

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I can give some kids shade or if it's raining.

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I keep those.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Smart.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Yeah.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Kenny in the chat.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Yeah, you can't coach soccer without an umbrella.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Matt, was that your issue with your soccer coaching?

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Did you not have enough umbrellas?

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Well, as you remember, we won our first game and that's because I entered like Mary Poppins.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I took the umbrella and I descended onto the field.

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Sure.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I gave everyone a spoonful of sugar before they hit the field.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Isn't that where the...

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 That was cocaine.

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That's why they won that first game.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 That was just a spoon of cocaine.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 The Umbro brand, right?

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 That's just a shorthand for umbrella.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Umbroella.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 That's why it's such a big thing in soccer.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Yeah, yeah.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Oh, Paul's second worst joke of the day.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So far.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 So far, exactly.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So far.

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I have yet to start.

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So what happened, Jacob?

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Well, I walked from one end of Caesars to the other outside and I was wet.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Drippy drip.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So finally, I gave up on that.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I went back inside.

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Oh, the one silver lining of the whole evening was I stopped at...

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 They had all these extra bars and extra little shops set up.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So I stopped at a little extra shop because I noticed they had the little airplane bottles

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 of Jameson.

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I was like, "Oh, I'll get myself a little airplane bottle of Jameson for this, what has turned

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 into a very long walk?"

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So I got up and got the airplane bottle of Jameson.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 New Year's Eve.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 There are no prices on anything.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 That's right.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Same thing with the Bodega umbrellas.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Oh, God.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I mean, a bottle of liquor on New Year's Eve in Vegas is a Bodega umbrella in New York.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 What was the price for that?

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Yo, a little shot bottle.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 A shot bottle.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Shot bottle of whiskey.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 The airplane bottle of whiskey, New Year's Eve at Caesar's Palace in a little pop-up thing.

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 These are normally just a few bucks at a liquor store.

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Yeah, this would normally be like $3.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Right.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I think about how these drinks around town are usually served in very ornate designer

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 thingies.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Oh, sure.

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They put in like some spiraling unicorn deal.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Jeff, you're exactly right.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Dynamic pricing is what they call it.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Ends up being like a $30 or $35 thing, maybe a little more, depending on how much alcohol.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But this is just the simplified thing.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But still, New Year's Eve, my guess is...

271
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Is this just a bottle?

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 My guess is $18.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 My gut initially was going to be like $10 or $12.

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Uh-huh.

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 But then I went to Disco to see it one last time with my kids, and we bought two bottles

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 of water on the way out, and it wasn't even New Year's Eve.

277
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And it was $10 each for Aquafina bottles.

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 $10.

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Stop it.

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 They should pay you to drink Aquafina.

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 That's the devil's dick water.

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 That is the nastiest shit ever.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You got to walk outside.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 You got to just walk outside and find the guys selling the bottles of water on the street.

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They sell them for a dollar or two.

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And it's just a case of bottle of water they got at Costco.

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Who cares?

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I said, at least put a different label on it.

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So at least put Aquatina on it.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 At least let me think I'm getting a different spring that's nicer.

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Or put a casino label on it or something like that.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Something.

293
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 But when you know it's Aquafina, you just shove it in my face.

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 $10 a piece.

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It was like a damper in the mood.

296
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Sure.

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I just went to Costco for under $4, Matt.

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I walked away with a brick of 40 waters.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Exactly.

300
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 When it comes to Aquafina.

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Four zero waters.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 When Ann and I bought that water at Costco the first time, we went up there.

303
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Because it's right up there next to the toilet paper and everything else.

304
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I was like, oh, OK.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Here we go.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Get some waters.

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And she goes, I go, how much do you think it is?

308
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 She goes, it's $4.

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I was like, no.

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 She says, yeah, it's $4.

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 My god.

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 You know who knows that?

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 The guys on the escalator selling the bottles of water for $2.

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 They do.

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I nearly had an out of body experience.

316
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 That was amazing.

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So the prevailing average seems to be around $18 to $20 here in the chat.

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 That's what I'm feeling.

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 $18.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Yeah.

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Less than $10.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Oh, OK.

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I was so pleasantly surprised.

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Yes.

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Wow.

326
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I handed the guy a 10.

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I like that they're gouging people for water.

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But when it comes to liquor, they're like, no, no, no.

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Stay true to yourself, fam.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Help yourself.

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 We've got to keep you on the straight and narrow.

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I handed the guy a $10 bill and that included the tip and it genuinely, I mean this sincerely.

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I felt better about Las Vegas.

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Somebody gets it.

335
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 They're still charging three times, four times what they paid for this.

336
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 They're still making an amazing profit.

337
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 It was a genuinely markup.

338
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I was like, I can live with this.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Because I was ready for him to be like, oh, that's $25.

340
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Right.

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 That's what I was prepared for.

342
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Oh, I was, I was so, that was, that was the only good part of my night.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So I drank my little baby bottle of Jameson.

344
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I did.

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I just, I just, I sipped on that as I walked through and, uh, well, this is not a good way to put this.

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Now that I, now that I hear myself saying this out loud, I sipped my little baby bottle of Jameson as I walked to my car.

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I hear that out loud now as I say it.

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And, uh, so I went to my car, so they closed off the strip.

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Cops cannot ask you to open a baby bottle.

350
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 That's a fact.

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 It's just a constitutional fact.

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 They can't, they gotta, they gotta have a warrant if they want to know what's inside that baby bottle.

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 That's what makes it different.

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 No, no, officer.

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I'm not using my baby bottle there to conduct business on a federal highway.

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So I don't need to have a driver license.

357
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 It's fine.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 What do you say?

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I'm a, I'm transporting.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Look at my binder of paper.

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I'm transporting this baby bottle, not driving it.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And I'm not doing it for interstate commerce.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So I go to the car and they close off all the roads around the strip.

364
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 You can't drive on the strip.

365
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 It's all pedestrian and everything.

366
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And the problem is SJ's gig is on the other side of the strip from where I am.

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 That's a big problem.

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 That's a big problem.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And so I spend about an hour driving around to different roads that the map says is open.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And they are all closed.

371
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And then finally at about 11, 15, 12, 1130, 1140, some, somewhere like that.

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I finally just say, fuck it.

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 If I turn right down this road, that will lead to my house.

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So that is where I'm going.

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 So I drove to my house.

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 I let the dogs out.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 We watched the fireworks from the backyard.

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It was fine.

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And then SJ came home a few hours later and brought friends home.

380
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And then I was up until six 30 in the morning anyway.

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So I did all of that and then didn't get to sleep early.

382
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 That sounds like a pretty good night overall.

383
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 It was fine.

384
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 It was perfectly nice.

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I love how true SJ is to herself.

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I love that she can always, always rally people after hours.

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 No problem.

388
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Two 30 in the morning, here comes SJ and friends.

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 It's like call it a night.

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 It's blood money when you work on New Year's Eve, especially on the strip.

391
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And no, no.

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And SJ had been out since like, I think she left the house at like 1 PM that day and was gone.

393
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 She took a shower and got into full makeup at like one o'clock in the afternoon because then she had multiple sound checks and multiple gigs and everything.

394
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And then two AM, two 30 in the morning.

395
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Here she comes rolling into the house with people going like, get the whiskey ready.

396
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I got people coming.

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I'm doing a show with your wife.

398
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 January 14th, Sarah Hester Ross is hosting a variety show downtown.

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Oh, wow.

400
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Oh, nice.

401
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I didn't know about this.

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I just got the.

404
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So good.

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 She sends you slides for you to post on social media.

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 She makes them herself and gives them to you, which is so nice.

407
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Oh, and this is is great at the socials.

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 We know this exactly.

409
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 We flip through it.

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I saw SJ out there and I was like, oh, great.

411
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I'm doing the same show as SJ.

412
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Nice.

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 January 14th at the composer's room, I think it's called.

414
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Oh, yeah.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Oh, that's a nice.

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That's a nice room there, too.

417
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Also a friend of the show.

418
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 She had a Christmas is doing that show, which I'm very excited.

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Excellent.

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Yeah.

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 So it should be a fun one.

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I haven't seen her in a long time.

423
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yeah.

424
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I'll tell you who else walked around all night on New Year's Eve and didn't really get much

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 done.

426
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And that is the following sponsor.

427
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Today's show, Matt and Manley's Ice Cream Social is brought to you by from the makers of dangerously

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 inaccurate AI generated medical school textbooks.

429
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 It's Robot Timeshare Salesman for cryptocurrency based feeding tubes, IVs and ventilators.

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 That's from the Gorilla Dentist from the Bjork video in twenty twenty four.

431
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I'll say it one more time for the makers of the dangerously inaccurate AI generated medical

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 school textbooks.

433
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's Robot Timeshare Salesman for cryptocurrency based feeding tubes, IVs and ventilators.

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Hey, how are you?

435
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I hope your day is going well.

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Are you in the market for medical equipment?

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 If so, come and buy some from me.

438
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 I'm a robot who sells medical equipment that's been made using AI technology.

439
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 The needles kind of work.

440
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 The tubes also sort of work.

441
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Also, I will.

442
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I'm basically a euthanasia robot.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 That's the whole thing.

444
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 You buy equipment from me and it malfunctions.

445
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Giant quotes around malfunctions.

446
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 I make murder tools for the medical industry.

447
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Are you tired of granny?

448
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Are you sick of Uncle Joe?

449
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Wait, you're going to kill them?

450
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 No, not directly.

451
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I will sell you faulty medical equipment that will lead to their demise.

452
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Hello.

453
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Yeah, I'm here.

454
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 My grandmother is she's a little she's a little sick.

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 She's got a little cough, but she's also just a pain in my ass.

456
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Do you have anything for that?

457
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 This is gauze made with AI.

458
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It's basically hemp rope, tie it tautly around her neck and leave it for four to three hours.

459
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Her head scoops and checked out.

460
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Four to three hours.

461
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Four to three hours.

462
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Here's an amount of time.

463
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 That robot is dumb.

464
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 That's actually robot in jail's cousin.

465
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 It's not the same guy though.

466
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Oh, good to know.

467
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Good to know.

468
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Good.

469
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Good.

470
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Different.

471
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Tracy, the bus driver scoop.

472
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It is Tracy, the bus driver scoops birthday today.

473
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Longtime supporter of the show.

474
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Tracy, the bus driver scoop.

475
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Love you.

476
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Happy birthday.

477
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Yeah.

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Heck.

479
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Yeah.

480
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So that was my New Year's Eve, gents.

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 How was I was yours?

482
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I hope yours was less wet.

483
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Mine was soaking wet.

484
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Mine was soaking wet.

485
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I was in bed by about 8 o'clock.

486
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 With passion.

487
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Yeah.

488
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Paul's was soaked with passion.

489
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I was in bed early and I wasn't feeling great and we got a crazy snowstorm.

490
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 We ended up with over six inches and I was like.

491
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Yeah, you did.

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 This is some bullshit.

493
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I was up and down all night not being able to sleep because I wasn't feeling well and

494
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I got up at one o'clock.

495
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I was up and down all night not being able to sleep because I wasn't feeling well and

496
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I got up at one o'clock.

497
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I was up and down all night not being able to sleep because I wasn't feeling well and

498
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I got up at one o'clock.

499
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I was up and down all night not being able to sleep because I wasn't feeling well and

500
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:30,120
 I got up at 1 30 to let the dogs out and we were in the middle of a squall.

501
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:37,400
 So I opened up a squall, opened up the door and it was just whoosh snow just I was like

502
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,920
 just come straight into the house.

503
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
 This is just too much to do.

504
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,920
 I'd say it'd be one thing if I didn't feel 100 percent, it'd be one thing if the roads

505
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 could possibly kill my Kia.

506
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,560
 I can't deal with both so I called out for New Year's Day.

507
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
 I was supposed to go with four.

508
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,800
 You do not have an automobile that is built for intimate weather on the roads.

509
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
 No, not at all.

510
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,900
 You have an automobile that is built for perfect weather on the roadways.

511
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,560
 Which is why it served me so well in Las Vegas but out here in the PA things get dicey and

512
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,880
 even when there's just a little bit like I was slipping and sliding even today driving

513
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,200
 home.

514
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 So the last time we had a really bad storm like this and I pushed through.

515
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,440
 I think we need to get Paul Mattingly a Silverado.

516
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,000
 I pushed through and I went through and I almost put it into a wall but Ann's got that

517
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,520
 newer Honda and it's got snowmode so she fears nothing.

518
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,760
 Oh, Ann's got snowmode.

519
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,160
 We know this about Ann.

520
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,400
 Do you tire shop out there Paul?

521
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,840
 What kind of tires do you get to make sure you're...

522
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,600
 Mine are just all weather Kumos, they're top notch Kumos.

523
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 Okay, all right.

524
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
 They're fine.

525
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
 They're fine.

526
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,660
 They're the tires that came with the car back in the day.

527
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,960
 So yeah, but...

528
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,800
 I just drive with snow chains on just in case no matter what.

529
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,480
 Yeah, just constantly chewing up the roads.

530
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:17,960
 No, I just, I couldn't, I was like no, I'm not going to risk this for a five hour shift

531
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,240
 where I could die.

532
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,880
 So I went back to sleep and yeah.

533
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,280
 Oh, Mike Nielsen in the chat is correcting you Paul.

534
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,700
 Just pronounced Kumho.

535
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,000
 That is the massage parlor I go to when I drive.

536
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 What?

537
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,320
 How did I end up here?

538
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,480
 I had no idea.

539
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,320
 I just typed Kumho in the Googles.

540
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,480
 How did I get Kumho?

541
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,480
 My goodness.

542
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,420
 I'm looking for just some kind of nice massaging thing.

543
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,120
 I was just looking for a reasonable massage.

544
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,560
 I'm not going to drive this place.

545
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
 I was going to massage tires.

546
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,920
 I was going to rub tires and see which ones were the best.

547
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,420
 That's what I came out here to do.

548
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,840
 That's what I was going to do.

549
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,320
 Kick the tires like the fire.

550
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,240
 I guess I'll go check it out though.

551
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,040
 I guess you can leave.

552
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 I sent Paul a picture with me and his old stage manager for New Year's Eve.

553
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
 That's what I did.

554
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
 It was very sweet.

555
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
 Yeah.

556
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,080
 Old stage manager from what?

557
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,440
 Second City.

558
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
 Nice.

559
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,160
 My friend Brooke Walquist.

560
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
 Yeah.

561
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,720
 So yeah, I ended up making it back.

562
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,920
 So I went out to Utah to do a show and a factor that made me nervous in the beginning and

563
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,960
 thankful at the end is that I forgot there's a time change between Las Vegas and Utah.

564
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
 Right.

565
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,520
 Now I was leaving to be over two hours early anyway, just in case.

566
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,440
 So I ended up getting there just like an hour and a half before my show, which is still

567
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,440
 plenty of time to set up and do everything.

568
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
 Still.

569
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,920
 But it was the Springdale Community Center in Springdale, Utah, which is just outside

570
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,480
 of Zion National Park.

571
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,720
 I never came to any of those cute little towns.

572
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,040
 There's a bunch of cute little tourist kind of cabiny towns.

573
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,640
 Yeah, they're very nice.

574
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,560
 And we did a show there and so my show was from 730 to 830.

575
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,000
 It was actually 630 to 730 Vegas time, which meant when I finished up even packing and

576
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,640
 everything and taking pictures and all that stuff, I still was able to get back to my

577
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,800
 family's New Year's Eve party at a local neighborhood.

578
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,960
 And I guess Paul's old stage manager lives in my neighborhood.

579
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,240
 He was over at our mutual friend, the Camusso's house, and getting to talking, he was like,

580
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
 you know, Paul Mattingly.

581
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,080
 And I was like, I love Paul Mattingly.

582
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,520
 To know him is to love.

583
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,760
 And I was like, more than know him in the biblical sense.

584
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,920
 We spent a good 20 minutes just raving about Paul going back and forth about Paul.

585
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,600
 And then I took a little photo with him.

586
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,160
 But I did the show up in Utah.

587
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,080
 I'll just real quick on that.

588
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
 That's really sweet.

589
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,640
 I just want to keep talking about me for a minute.

590
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,800
 But no, that's really, really nice.

591
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,880
 And no, Brooke, Brooke really helped me out early on.

592
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
 And she really did help lobby for me early on getting on the stage.

593
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I brought it up.

594
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I go, I can't believe it.

595
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,600
 Like I said, it took a letter campaign to get Paul on the Second City main stage or

596
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 whatever.

597
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 She goes, oh, that was such, you know, whatever.

598
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,960
 And she just talked about the politics of Second City and how annoying it was.

599
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,320
 And all the things she navigated and stuff.

600
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 Yeah.

601
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,760
 And she was very sweet when she left.

602
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,720
 She wrote notes to everybody.

603
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,560
 And the note she sent to me said, I might not always be your boss, but I'll always be

604
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
 a fan.

605
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,720
 And I thought that was really, really sweet.

606
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
 Oh, wow.

607
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
 That's beautiful.

608
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
 Yeah.

609
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,800
 She really did champion me getting onto that main stage spot.

610
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,200
 So I appreciate that from Brooke big time.

611
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
 Yeah.

612
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
 Yeah.

613
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 Well, she was good.

614
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
 Yeah.

615
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
 Her and her husband were great.

616
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
 I got to chat with them a little bit.

617
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
 It's cool.

618
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
 Super fun.

619
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,920
 But yeah, so the event up in Utah was simply for locals who want to come to CUNY Center.

620
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:27,760
 They could be taught to country line dance, eat a nice meal, and then get an entertainment

621
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,720
 event, which was me.

622
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,360
 How did the line dancing teaching go for you?

623
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,440
 Man, I'm trying to set up and it was like I was playing like Frogger, right?

624
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,600
 Like I'm trying to run stuff out and like everybody's just moving like all over the

625
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,400
 place that I'm trying to carry.

626
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:56,160
 And I don't want them to look at the props, see all your stuff.

627
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,000
 So I'm like, you know, just trying to like keep all eyes on my eyes.

628
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
 Like I'm looking up at anyone looking at me, like, you know, seeing your fish.

629
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 Yeah.

630
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,040
 And it was like, it's like a like ninja camp for misdirection.

631
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,960
 It was like, I like this a lot.

632
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,200
 Can you get all these people to not look at the stuff you're carrying your hands?

633
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,360
 And so and then it was funny is that like someone was teaching them the steps, but she

634
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,640
 was just shouting over the top or whatever.

635
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,480
 And so like while I'm in my little changing area dressing room, IE someone's office, and

636
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,680
 I just keep hearing just shouting like, and left to right tip and just like just screaming

637
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,560
 instructions and I was like, this is going to lose her voice.

638
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,040
 That's so wild.

639
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,200
 Now, I guess were they able to respond properly to these commands?

640
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,400
 Do they know what they meant instinctively or did she have to be like, you know, a little

641
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:04,700
 more descriptive of the, I don't know, I was too busy putting weird shit in my pockets

642
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:10,320
 in the right order to, to figure it out.

643
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,200
 But and then they had, yeah, they had dinner and then I did the show and it was fine.

644
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,840
 Like the, my went up there, my mic didn't work and I switched the other mic and that

645
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,680
 mic also was feeding back and then I just said, you guys can hear me.

646
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
 Yes.

647
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,120
 And then I did the whole show kind of just really kind of talking loudly in the room,

648
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
 but it worked.

649
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
 It worked out fine.

650
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,120
 It was a great show, super fun, great audience.

651
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,480
 You know, the thing about the secret thing about love playing shows in Jeff Lewis and

652
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,320
 chances if Matt had real magical powers, he wouldn't need to load things in his pockets.

653
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:59,200
 I just saw, I just saw a tick or tick tock where this lady was said my, what's that thing

654
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:08,440
 they say my hot take or what have you, you know, my hot take is that some magicians are

655
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,280
 actually magic and they just start practicing magic because they can do magic and it's easy

656
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,800
 for them and they just, and they hide the fact that they're magic by doing magic.

657
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,840
 That's the, that's a great, it's a, that's the logic that made me think I could fool

658
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:32,440
 Penn and Teller is a, you know, with a, with a trick that Penn showed you, yes, maybe,

659
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,600
 maybe I could have double bluffed it and I would have gone my way.

660
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,800
 Oh my God, this is, this is going way too far back.

661
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
 That's first appearance.

662
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,440
 I'd fool us if you had somehow just put something in there to make it try to appear as though

663
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,400
 you were doing a different method on it.

664
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 Yeah.

665
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
 He was paranoid.

666
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:01,200
 Penn was paranoid that I was, but about halfway through it was like, no, he's not.

667
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,360
 I was only, I was only 14 months into magic.

668
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,080
 It's not like I had to throw any bells and whistles on something.

669
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,400
 You know, all you are now, all you had to do was dress up like a horse and cut off your

670
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
 thumb.

671
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:23,640
 You would have gotten a one who's a pretty, pretty price.

672
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,880
 I didn't do proper misdirection for Penn and Teller, which is actually injuring yourself

673
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,800
 and feeding blood to European magicians.

674
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 Yeah.

675
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,680
 So I finished the show and a woman comes up and she's like, you work with Penn and Teller

676
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,640
 and she starts talking to me and she seems like as, as politely as I can phrase it, something

677
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,120
 has happened with her brain at some point in her life.

678
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
 Oh, okay.

679
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
 I don't know.

680
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
 I don't have to say anymore.

681
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:07,280
 I don't have to get an injury anymore, just whatever the way is to say, something's something.

682
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
 Something happened.

683
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
 I don't know.

684
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 With this person.

685
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
 Was she a football player?

686
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,960
 Yeah, she was, she was, she just finished up the season.

687
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,640
 She just lost her starting spot in the Miami dolphins to Quinn yours.

688
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,440
 And so she had free time.

689
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:32,600
 His lady's name was Richie incognito.

690
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,520
 So she's like, I really like them.

691
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
 Oh, it's good.

692
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,880
 She was, I was wanting to see their show in Vegas.

693
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
 I said, now's a great time to see it.

694
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
 You know, it's like, it's a, it's, it's, it's, they just finished.

695
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
 Right.

696
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,920
 It's the 20th year at the Rio.

697
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,880
 It's their 50th year as a duo, but they just finished up all of their 50th anniversary

698
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
 obligations.

699
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,360
 And so they're, they're, they're hunkered down at the Rio for the time being.

700
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 Oh, good.

701
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,040
 And she goes, I'm, I'm a little out of it because I just had major surgery.

702
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,360
 And I go, Oh, no, stop it.

703
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
 Okay.

704
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,880
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

705
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:14,560
 And I'm glad like today, like this, this procedure just happened like a few hours ago.

706
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
 Are you fresh?

707
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,120
 The things that were happening in the, in the place that was line dancing, there was

708
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
 magic.

709
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:29,040
 The doctor is, Oh, ours, the trunk of my car took the turns a little fast on the way here.

710
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
 No.

711
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,680
 I said, Oh, I'm sorry to hear glad you made it.

712
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
 You made it out.

713
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,920
 I hope you have a recovery made it out to the show.

714
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:49,480
 You know, you made it out of surgery, die flat operating table.

715
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,760
 She might've pulled, pulled an RJ Owens and her companion is with her.

716
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,720
 I don't know who her companion is, but the gentleman companion is a guy with her.

717
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
 I don't know.

718
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 It could be brother.

719
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,400
 It could be whatever, but male companion, at least male presenting companion.

720
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,660
 It's his job here that I'm, I'm more concerned about.

721
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,160
 Like for example, if he was like, Oh yes, she would love to see Penn and teller, right?

722
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,200
 If I felt like I had like a, an accurate wing guy, I might've been like, all right, well,

723
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,680
 let me see if I can help you out kind of thing.

724
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,360
 But I did not feel like that I could accurately exchange information with this woman in order

725
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,680
 to facilitate tickets.

726
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,160
 So I just said good luck or did you trust this wingman and that thing he didn't step

727
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
 up, right?

728
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
 So I was like, he's hanging back.

729
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
 So he's just letting her hang.

730
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
 I'm going to let it hang.

731
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
 I don't know.

732
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
 All right.

733
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
 She has the ability to travel.

734
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
 That's always a lot.

735
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
 Yeah.

736
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
 Yeah.

737
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,880
 A long way to go for not necessarily any dividends there.

738
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,360
 So she starts talking about our show.

739
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
 I agree.

740
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,520
 We said again, Jacob, a Penn and teller show.

741
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
 I agree.

742
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,160
 It's a long way to go to see a Penn and teller show without a whole lot of benefit.

743
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,320
 Well, now wait.

744
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,800
 So she starts to talk about her operation and this talk about how her nose lit up red

745
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:16,120
 when the surgeon missed his mark and I said, I'm glad you're better or whatever.

746
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,360
 And I'm kind of give a glance, not a, not a, not a knowing glance, but just a quick look

747
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,980
 over to be like, cool.

748
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:27,160
 Like do you want her to keep talking about this operation, right?

749
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,520
 Like do you want this sort of everybody's still happy with this interaction?

750
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
 Okay.

751
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,000
 So she is just hands and pockets on his heels.

752
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,660
 And then she lifts up her sweatshirt and lowers her sweatpants to show a gigantic scar across

753
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,920
 the entire torso of her body.

754
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,600
 Oh, they, they opened her up.

755
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:57,520
 I was like, wow, you have believed you before.

756
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,800
 I hope you didn't note skepticism and the major operation.

757
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,480
 Did she say I, uh, I love Penn and teller because I like when they saw the lady in half.

758
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,800
 It reminds me of my operation.

759
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,680
 It reminds me of lunch today.

760
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,000
 I think I could fill in for the cut in half lady.

761
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,440
 Take that on my resume.

762
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,880
 How, how fresh did the, uh, did the incision look?

763
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
 Fresh.

764
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
 Oh no.

765
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
 Like not today.

766
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,880
 But it was, was it, uh, was it gliss, was it glistening?

767
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,200
 Was it oozy and glistening?

768
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
 Was it moist to want to focus on this?

769
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
 Okay.

770
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,320
 But were there, were there like black stitches in it?

771
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
 Yes.

772
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
 Oh, it's fresh.

773
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,000
 Oh, that's like, that's like within a week and a half, dude.

774
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Yes.

775
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Those things don't hang around long.

776
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,040
 No, it was maybe, Oh my God.

777
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 Oh Lord.

778
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,800
 What is she doing at a magic show line dance combo dancing?

779
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,620
 I hope she was sitting down for the dancing.

780
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,920
 My doctors told me not to, but you know, me, I can't, I love me some dancing.

781
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,640
 I, I'd like to compliment your show.

782
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,080
 Best compliment I can give you as a comedic magician.

783
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,920
 I found you truly side splitting.

784
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:31,720
 Look at my open wounds, you split my sides open.

785
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
 You bastard.

786
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
 Yeah.

787
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,680
 I really enjoyed your show today.

788
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,240
 It was a, it was a very nice show.

789
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,280
 I, I, uh, in lieu of a tip, I am giving you a kidney.

790
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,040
 You ripped me asshole to appetite.

791
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,880
 You opened me wider than the mammoth cave.

792
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,240
 You cracked me like the Liberty bell.

793
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,360
 Oh, Boston.

794
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,520
 I just was like, Oh, okay.

795
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
 Okay.

796
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
 Yes.

797
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,920
 She was literally in stitches and he literally like, he like very generally was like, okay.

798
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,480
 Like, but he still, there wasn't like, you know, Hey, you know, like, let's say, let's

799
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
 keep it together.

800
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
 You know, whatever.

801
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
 It just was like, let's keep it together.

802
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
 I don't know.

803
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:27,280
 I thought that the associate, yes, or, uh, uh, whoever, whoever, whoever the person with

804
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,840
 her handler, romantic other.

805
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
 What do you think?

806
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,960
 Did you get any vibe for the relationship?

807
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:42,560
 My vibe, if I had to guess was romantic other, do you think because he was romantic other

808
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,920
 during this, what can I say?

809
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,320
 Reveal of delicate damage body.

810
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,240
 Someone else has it already said a million times.

811
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:06,320
 Do you think that he was also like, Oh God, what am I married to now?

812
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,320
 Was this like a Frankenstein moment?

813
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:16,200
 Was he like the sepsis got to her noggin and things didn't go right?

814
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,080
 Like, like, is this, is this like a, is this like those times?

815
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:26,280
 I have been begging her to show me this car and she would not, and then you fancy pants

816
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,480
 magician come walking in here.

817
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
 Right.

818
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
 Right.

819
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,720
 All of a sudden, Matt just gets punched.

820
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,760
 See, did you, did you get the vibe that he was like a scar filiac?

821
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
 Oh yeah.

822
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
 Yeah.

823
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
 Yeah.

824
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
 He just was really good.

825
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
 He revealed the scar.

826
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
 He just buddy armed me.

827
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,960
 It was like, huh, oh, oh, he comes over, he's like, I've got it.

828
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,560
 I've got a cut of the lion King where it's only that lion with the scar on his eye.

829
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,760
 It's very short, but very gratifying.

830
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,240
 This guy just, he lives for flesh wounds.

831
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,760
 He was simply just, that's what floats his boat.

832
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,800
 That's what gets us passive.

833
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,400
 He just was simply so like, yeah, yeah, you know, like we had a good time.

834
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,320
 You know, it was very, it just, he just was, well, maybe he's, he's had his way with that

835
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,420
 new scar and now he's like, well, now I just got to wait for the next operation.

836
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,400
 Why do you think it was still so pink?

837
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,920
 He can't get turned on anymore.

838
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,000
 She got that operation a month and a half ago, but he's keeping that scar fresh.

839
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,840
 It just totally overwhelmed and now he's over it.

840
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
 Yeah.

841
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
 That's how it goes.

842
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,120
 Y'all, you always want, which you can't have, he just, he's just an Uber driver who waits

843
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:49,160
 by the hospital for this phone to do, Hey, how'd it go?

844
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
 Oh yeah.

845
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:58,960
 Stitches pop in because, uh, you know what, you know, the old saying stitches lose britches

846
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,160
 on your phone.

847
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
 This one's on me.

848
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,720
 This is not me.

849
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
 Stitches lose britches.

850
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
 Get in.

851
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:16,160
 I'll tell you who else has turned on sexually by surgical scars.

852
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,640
 That's the following sponsor show is brought to you by goose.

853
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,280
 The musical it's from Mike Nielsen.

854
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:33,120
 It's goose, the musical, uh, give me some music, Jacob music.

855
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
 Would you like?

856
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,120
 I don't care.

857
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
 All right.

858
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:55,200
 See if I could even hear it, the surgery didn't go exactly how I wanted it to go, but I'm

859
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:03,160
 here at the dance hall slash magic show.

860
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:14,400
 I want to show off my belly, the stitches to the magic man and let him put his fingers

861
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:22,120
 into my severed care.

862
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,120
 That's out.

863
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:41,680
 Goose goes the wound in my belly, goose, goose, goose goes the sore on my side, goose, goose,

864
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
 goose go.

865
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:53,480
 My stitches inside me, goose, goose, goose, I've turned into a slip and slide.

866
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,720
 Goose.

867
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,880
 This is where my, my mental note is.

868
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:06,720
 I can't share this episode to Instagram because we'll get demonetized cause Paul was singing

869
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,720
 the goose song.

870
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
 Are you kidding me?

871
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,920
 That's a number one hit.

872
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,200
 The goose song, goose.

873
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
 There it is.

874
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,440
 Multiple vomit emojis from the scooping over girl and chat because it was so good.

875
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,200
 But she comes back with goose episode title.

876
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:36,200
 So this is the thing you got to understand about me, Matt.

877
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:45,000
 I think you do understand that I will take it there and make you love it.

878
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,640
 This is like, this is where I hope someone's like at the, like the drive through pharmacy

879
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:55,200
 or the bank, right, right, or, or receiving a traffic ticket.

880
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:05,800
 Goose from the scar of my belly is just blaring out as they exchange money.

881
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:22,000
 We have confirmed ruined at least one scoops dinner.

882
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,060
 The best thing about goose, it doesn't tell you it could be anything that is genuinely

883
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,400
 the best thing about goose.

884
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,320
 It's something emanating from a wound.

885
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:45,260
 I leave the rest to your fertile imaginations.

886
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,760
 There are multiple things that can emanate from a wound.

887
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,360
 Well, here I am just writing the whole fucking musical.

888
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,040
 I better pump my brakes.

889
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,200
 TM, TM is right.

890
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,480
 If you can do a musical called corn, I can do a musical called goose.

891
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,440
 Oh, I would watch, I'd watch goose over corn or whatever, 10 times out of 10.

892
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,960
 You have that correct?

893
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,960
 That is correct.

894
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,960
 That's what I mean.

895
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,080
 People that made that show.

896
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,080
 All right.

897
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:30,520
 Time for goose goose goose out of hell, goose out of hell.

898
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
 Yeah.

899
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,120
 It probably does have a meatloaf vibe.

900
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,600
 Oh, there's, there's also the, the, the, the big hit song from goose.

901
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,320
 Yeah.

902
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,040
 Something happened to my brain at some point.

903
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:56,680
 That's the torch song number at some point, something happened to my brain for intermission.

904
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:07,840
 And of course it's the big, the big surgical race goose lightning.

905
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:14,160
 There's an operating room in the back of my car.

906
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:22,360
 It's very hard to steer while he's operating on me in the car.

907
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
 Cut me up.

908
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
 Cut me down.

909
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:34,000
 In the car, Ooh, it's a nice goose lightning.

910
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,480
 Something's emanating from that scar.

911
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
 Goosh.

912
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,480
 Feed me.

913
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,720
 What could it be?

914
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,980
 Feed me.

915
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,000
 The scar goes quaddo slash Audrey.

916
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,960
 Audrey T.

917
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,000
 I loved, did you guys see the, the Christmas ad with Travolta in it with him doing the,

918
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,560
 the grease lightening thing with the Santa sleigh?

919
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
 What was that?

920
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,360
 You notice how they didn't even, I have no idea what it's for.

921
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,200
 Did you notice how they didn't even try to match up the lyrics with his mouth movements?

922
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:17,600
 No, they were like, it seems like they had for like three hours is like, yeah, we got

923
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
 that shot moving on.

924
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,600
 No, sir.

925
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
 We didn't get moving on.

926
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,480
 We don't wheels up in 10.

927
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
 Let's go.

928
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:32,840
 Like his mouth is not moving close to what the words are doing.

929
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
 It's weird.

930
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,480
 And yeah, I have no idea what that ad is for.

931
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,080
 Uh, I forgot.

932
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:45,800
 Did I talk to you guys about the club gray skull She-Ra hat, or was that another thing?

933
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,440
 I don't think you talked to us about it.

934
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,800
 No, I think it was about us.

935
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,800
 Okay.

936
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:55,200
 Well, I guess I talked about it at during the scoop chat, but yeah.

937
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:03,320
 So if you go on Mattel creations website, Mattel creation, all the time, which I do

938
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,320
 all the time.

939
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
 I do.

940
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:11,560
 Uh, but, uh, you know, they have club gray skull, which is their little thing and they,

941
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:19,080
 they sell merchandise and one of the things they sell is, uh, a new hat that they've created

942
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,560
 just in the last couple of weeks.

943
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,120
 It's She-Ra's 40th anniversary.

944
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:30,280
 So they decided to make a She-Ra hat, but what they've done is they've created Schrodinger's

945
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,480
 ball cap.

946
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:52,080
 It is a red baseball hat, which given today's political climate has ramifications and yeah,

947
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,320
 it means something, right?

948
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,320
 Right.

949
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:04,580
 However, this red baseball cap also, there it is, has the words She-Ra princess of power

950
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,980
 written on it.

951
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:15,640
 So I don't know that a lot of She-Ra fans are going to want to go around in a red baseball

952
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
 cap.

953
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,200
 This might be the target demo.

954
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:31,200
 This is just for Sidney Sweeney, just for Sidney Sweeney, that's absolutely, I would

955
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,560
 assume is some kind of, I would, I, if I saw that hat, cause the She-Ra's thoughts

956
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,560
 very small.

957
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,140
 Yeah, it is.

958
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,140
 And the wings are pretty big.

959
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,440
 That's the weird thing to me about it is that it's not that it's red, but it's like, that's

960
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,600
 her helmet.

961
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,000
 From far away, I would have thought it was a, uh, military background Republican.

962
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,160
 Uh, that's what I would think if I saw that hat from afar.

963
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,160
 Yeah.

964
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
 Right.

965
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,160
 Right.

966
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,640
 So I don't know what Mattel is smoking that they would choose a red cap.

967
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,600
 I get it so far as color coordinate, but you could go white.

968
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,280
 You could go blue.

969
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,760
 You could go pink or whatever.

970
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,120
 Many years ago was why I went to like wine country and we bought, I bought this red

971
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:18,200
 trucker hat from his diner in, uh, uh, uh, Northern California.

972
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,080
 And I was wearing it around and I was at first getting compliments, make America great again

973
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,440
 on it on my cool diner, like vintage diner, trucker hat, right.

974
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,680
 And then all of a sudden, one day I got mistaken for a MAGA hat and it was a guy giving me

975
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,160
 a thumbs up from across the coffee shop and my friend being like, he thinks you're wearing

976
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
 a MAGA hat.

977
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
 And I was like, what?

978
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,160
 I was like, no.

979
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,080
 And at that time I was like, how many people are really wearing those?

980
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:50,440
 Um, oh, you sweet summer child.

981
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,680
 Oh, I was, I missed it by a mile and, uh, uh, but yeah, I eventually had to stop wearing

982
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,760
 it because everyone was starting, everyone was starting to think of it was a MAGA hat.

983
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,320
 Oh, you got a, you got one of your hats ruined because people said it looked like a MAGA

984
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
 hat.

985
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,840
 Oh, that's, that's tough shit.

986
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:18,080
 Jacob has absolutely been victimized by that on camera right here with his Las Vegas hat

987
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,240
 that is Las Vegas aviators.

988
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,000
 That hat is much better than the one I'm talking about for my trucker trucker hat.

989
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,480
 Beautiful happens, happens to look weird.

990
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:37,240
 Uh, there's a guy, there was a guy driving down my street and, you know, that, that sketch

991
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:43,080
 and, uh, I think you should leave with the call, like the, the driving crooner or whatever

992
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:48,560
 it's called, where he puts the stickers, makes it look like he's smoking a cigar and wearing

993
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,560
 it.

994
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,560
 Yes.

995
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,560
 On the window.

996
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,560
 Yeah.

997
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,880
 Uh, in the back of this guy's truck, in the cab section behind his main cab, he has,

998
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,080
 you know how you can put a little sticker on the window.

999
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,080
 Yes.

1000
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:08,600
 He's got, he's got our president in the back seat, the neck and head of the president,

1001
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:16,920
 you know, looking like, oh, he's sitting in the back seat and he's tooling around in there

1002
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,320
 for good.

1003
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:24,280
 And I casually yelled out the window, he didn't hear me of course, but I warned him, you've

1004
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,520
 got a pedophile in your truck.

1005
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
 Look out, careful.

1006
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,240
 He's behind you.

1007
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,520
 Um, yeah.

1008
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:40,280
 So may have fallen on deaf ears, maybe, maybe, uh, feel free to always give Matt a thumbs

1009
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,360
 up if you see him wearing a red hat from now on to thumbs up in his scars.

1010
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,320
 It's like, it's like where I've had to wear my Hooters jacket and, uh, cause there's too

1011
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,160
 much weight in my, in my bags.

1012
00:56:53,160 --> 00:57:00,840
 And then I get some, I get compliments on like nice jacket and you're like, no, no,

1013
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,340
 it is not.

1014
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:24,240
 Please don't, let's do a little joke versus nerd, I'm on the hunt for balls on the hunt

1015
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,280
 for balls.

1016
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:44,060
 I'm on the hunt for balls, I'm on the hunt for balls, I'm on the hunt for balls, I'm

1017
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:59,960

1099
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:50,520
 I'm on the hunt for balls, I'm on the hunt for balls.

1100
01:25:50,520 --> 01:26:05,820
 Let me know that the word basically was doing a lot of heavy lifting in Matt's sentence.

1101
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:10,040
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preachingfun.com takes you over to our Patreon page where for

1102
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,480
 as little as $3 a month you can upkeep this show on the air.

1103
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,820
 Like Matt said, we are dependent on our Patreons.

1104
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,240
 We love each and every one of you.

1105
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,240
 Thank you so much.

1106
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,520
 Just show the Patreons the email we got for last month for like, "Hey, money's coming

1107
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,520
 your way."

1108
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,080
 And then I clicked on it and went like, "What?"

1109
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,080
 From the ad revenue.

1110
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:35,360
 Put it this way, our podcast company could not buy Jacob and Jameson on New Year's Eve.

1111
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,360
 Oh no!

1112
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:42,640
 And they're pretty reasonably priced, they're pretty reasonably priced.

1113
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,640
 Oh no.

1114
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,960
 That's right, we are dependent on our Patreon supporters out there.

1115
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,520
 It's as little as $3, you can do the support every month, you can do it for the year, if

1116
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,960
 you do it for the year you get a little discount on there, and it really helps us out, it lets

1117
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,560
 us do this thing that hopefully you're enjoying as well.

1118
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,560
 Yeah.

1119
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,260
 And if we break over a certain month, rather than give you a bonus episode, we will go

1120
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,460
 to community college for geography.

1121
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,460
 That's what we will do.

1122
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,480
 We'll take a CSN course.

1123
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,480
 Speak for yourself.

1124
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:18,920
 I'd rather a bonus episode.

1125
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,920
 Thanks for this everybody.

1126
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,920
 Stay safe out there.

1127
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,920
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1128
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:21,920
 We'll see you soon.

1129
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:58,640
 We're sending out preaching smarts.

1130
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,400
 Never claimed to be.
