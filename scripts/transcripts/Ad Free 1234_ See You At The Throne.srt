1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you're here. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Thank you so much Ice Cream Truck Drivers. It's a new month, we don't have a new list just yet, but we will thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Before the show starts, this part of the show right here, on a future show, not this show, this show we're already recording now, and I don't have the list yet.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 But thank you to all you Ice Cream Truck Drivers out there, those are the folks that deliver that fucking Ice Cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 If you would like to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and I sure hope you do, because that Ice Cream needs a driving.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I just feel like you say-

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Here's the show!

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Hey, let's go!

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's better.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Hey, if you want to join the Scoop Fantasy Football League, Jacob and I are playing.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Just go over to Scoop Fantasy Football League group on Facebook, and ask to be invited into the group, and Matt Daugherty will take care of you.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social, sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly, sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Daugherty, and in Las Vegas too, let's check out the audio guys, we're PreachingFun.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Preaching for the fun.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I'm not anywhere until August 20th to 24th, I'll be in the Magic Castle.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Nice.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And then, then someone went to like give me a weekend at a Magic Club, and I looked at September, October, November, December, and I was like, I can come in January.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Oh, you're booked.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I am booked.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 That's wonderful.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Yes, it is good, it is good, no complaints, no complaints.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Now, you're home for a little bit then, for like a week or two.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Yes.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And are the boys still out of school right now?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Right, as the last week, they start school August 11th.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Okay, so you're finally putting your boys in school.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Yeah, the homeschooling thing turned out to be, you know, it's for some people.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Yeah, yeah, no, I get you.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 But it turns out if I'm on a cruise ship, you know, virtual learning from me on a cruise ship is not really the best way to...

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Oh, can you imagine any of us just homeschooling in general? Just homeschooling anyone's children.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Look, we went through the pandemic, so every parent has a taste of what they'd be like as a homeschooling teacher, no matter what.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And part of it was a little, I mean, as it was daunting for all of us, it was exciting at some point.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like at one point we were like on our own for a couple of weeks while the schools figured out what they were doing.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We were like diving in at home trying to figure out ways to like do cool stuff, like anything our kids were curious about.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Turns out there's a YouTube documentary on something or the other.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 That's true.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Whatever. And so we did for a little while have like we're going to watch an educational documentary a day.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 We did work on their stuff.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 The strange thing was that in the panic of, and maybe other parents relate, in the panic of schools getting their shit together,

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 originally they just put together work packets for the parents to do at home.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Right, I remember that.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And then they switched to giving everyone a computer and doing virtual classrooms with the teachers in the classrooms.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And the virtual classrooms with a kindergartner and a first grader were useless.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Yeah.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And the work packet stuff was awesome.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Like I actually liked when they were just handing us different work packets to do at home.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Yeah, you could teach from that, sure.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Like it was really great.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And so I basically remember like a month into like the virtual classrooms and watching my kids just like, you know,

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 when like kids are so bored, they're like crying with boredom, like they're just like aching with boredom.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Like I was just like.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I see that happen automatically every now and then too.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 On this show, on this show.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I'm not immune.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I was like, I wish we were just working on the packet stuff.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But I guess for people who actually had to like work work and not just cry and hope that entertainment wasn't over as a thing.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Those people were more and more grateful for the virtual classrooms.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 That's probably true.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Yeah, yeah.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Are you guys up on the descendants?

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You guys up on all the zombies movies on all the Disney on the Disney Channel?

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I am not.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 The descendants are doing zombies right now.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 There's two franchises in the Disney world.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 One is called Descendants and one is called Zombies.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Zombies is like the B franchise.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Descendants.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Like last year, I went to the kids Halloween parade and I was like, why is everybody wearing dressed as I was like, is everyone dressed like Deadpool?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And turns out no, no, they're all dressed as this character Red from Descendants.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Yeah.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And his thing, my my oldest kid didn't get in either one of them.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 My youngest got into the zombies thing.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But then Kimmy Gatewood, Apple sister.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Yes.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Got hired to direct the latest Descendants movie.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Oh, wow.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And then all of the Disney, right?

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So then all of a sudden there's these concerts with all the people from zombies and descendants doing live concerts across the nation.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And so Kimmy got everybody backstage passes.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So all the Apple, all the Apple children went to the concert and then went backstage and met everyone who's in Descendants and Zombies.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And the side effect of that is that it is way into it now.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 All my kids listen to in the car like everywhere, it's like we're driving Arizona and back and driving them all to, you know, their soccer and drums and also their stuff for kids houses.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I am just listening constantly to Disney music and it is driving me insane.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Who is Red a descendant of?

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Because they're all descendant from like famous heroes and villains of Disney.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Yes. And it's hysterical because in the show, they'll be like, and my dad, you know, you know, Maui or whatever, they go.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And everybody acts shocked when they find out a kid is related.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Like basically the show is just a parallel of like like a Beverly Hills Grammar School where like everybody just finds out that their parents work in show business one place or the other.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So every single character is a child of a major Disney character and they all have a wink to what there is.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And so Red is the child of the queen of hearts.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Ah, so OK, a bad person.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Most of them are. It's mostly the children of villains.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Yeah. But are they good children?

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Yes, they go through their own adventures where they figure out whether they're going to be good or evil.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So it's runaways. That's cool.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Yeah, yeah. But Disney owns Marvel now.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So that's totally fine.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Yeah, yeah.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 No, I mean, I'm fine with it.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I will not have you disparage the originality of them where they're rehashing all of them.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I don't know if Brian is writing credit on descendants.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 He may that be great.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Who are the runaways children of of all kinds of Marvel villains?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Yeah. Yeah, but they're like mid-tier villains that you don't necessarily know that much about.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 But I like that your point is that it is even more unoriginal feeling than it was already feeling.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Don't worry, Matt. It's already not that good.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 They're like we have two options.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 We can either pretend to zap them and make them go back in time to children or we can say that they're children of the property we already own.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Yes. Cooper Nova girl in the chat.

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Marvel, baby, is that making your dreams come true?

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I never watch runaways. I never watch runaways either. I read it.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I can't speak to the quality. Oh, no, I can't speak to the quality of the show.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I'm not pleased. He's up motherfuckers.

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Take a moment to puff on that pipe, you intellectual.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I've not heard the best things about the film adaptation.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I prefer to see it happen in the eye of my mind.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 No, honestly. Yeah. No, no. I mean, it's a graphic novel.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I don't have those kinds of abilities, Jacob. I can't just read books. I need picture books.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Come on. Yeah, I read it.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 But the thing is like it's it's Disney, right?

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So they have like these crazy, you know, music and, you know, everything's a musical and that kind of stuff.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And it's all really well produced music.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Like some of them are catchy, which the snag is that it's all sung through the throats of very precocious children.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So like it's all like these really super like it could be like rap or R&B or like all these things that like a very popular music.

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And then it's just like tiny children singing it.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And you're like, it's so weird. Yeah, it's kids bop.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And it really kind of makes me I'm like, is this a good thing or a bad thing?

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Do you guys listen to kids bop? Did you go through a kids bop phase when I was younger now?

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 No, I mean, with the kid with your kids.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 No, this is the part of like the things like I like I said, like my kids were born just after Frozen was popular.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And I was like so glad to not be you miss that listening to that on repeat.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And, you know, Moana didn't catch on as as feverishly as as that.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 No. And then my kids got into like real music.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So they always used to switch from basically real music to like just YouTube, YouTubers, YouTube music, where they just sing about video games.

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And some of that was pretty good. And some of that's just strange to me.

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But they go back and forth. Is Hill still in his Gigi Allen phase?

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Because I know he was way into that.

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Wait, who was the drummer that you had to like wear raincoats and stuff to perform with him because he was so disgusting?

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Well, Keith Moon, because he was always crazy with Ginger Baker. He was dangerous. Oh, I don't know. No, I don't know.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I don't know. No, never.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Anyway, anyway, whatever he did, he did all kinds of gross stuff on stage to, you know, he'll use it in the car used to fall asleep to Iron Man.

145
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 That was the way to get him to fall asleep was that he would just chill to Iron Man and the Sabbath Iron Man.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So, you know, and then we went and saw MJ the musical over the summer.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And so Michael Jackson music was dominating our household, which obviously gives me mixed emotions as a parent.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 But the music is catchy, but the music is well made.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And so now I'm stuck in Disney produced weird music land.

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Would you prefer the Disney or Michael Jackson?

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Well, I would let me say I would not have liked someone getting a backstage pass for my children to meet Michael Jackson.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 So let's just say let's start there. Oh, interesting, interesting. OK, OK.

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 We're different people. All right.

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 No, my only my only hope for the coming out of this phase is that my my my oldest is still in school of rock.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And so he is learning different rock songs on drums and he has a concert coming up.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I'm hoping that that music will take over the car soon.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That's what I'm hoping probably will. There you go.

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Yeah, probably. What's his favorite music to play?

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Like a favorite song to play or anything. Yeah.

161
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I mean, like he plays like like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Weezer, trying to think what else they go through over there.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Yeah, he plays it. He plays a bunch of different stuff to destroy my sweater.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 No. Weezer, man. Yeah.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I would love it if your son just started singing Weezer randomly all the time around me.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 It would be so confusing, but so delightful.

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 When they first dropped, I had a class that I had to go to.

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 But at the record store down in Louisville, they were putting on a show in Louisville.

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Yeah, like three dollars right when the Blue Album first hit.

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And I was like, oh, I really wanted to go, but I didn't really know much about them.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And I had like, like I said, I had some other little responsibility.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 But boy, if I could go back in time, I would tell me to go see Weezer for three dollars.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Yeah. So one thing we didn't get into last episode.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 But I was debating whether to share it or not. But it was a low point for me.

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I was when I was hosting Magic Live. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And I basically we finished one of our shows and I said I'm going to have to go to the bathroom,

176
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 but I'm going to go downstairs because I don't want to hear what people think of the show in the bathroom across from the venue.

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Oh, no. OK. Buddy, you're already overthinking this.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And also, like, take a walk, like get away, like go. OK, there you go.

179
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom. What's the rule?

180
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Just get out of the magic blocks. What? I don't know.

181
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Oh, my my rule was always next county, next county.

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Yeah. You couldn't say anything about the show or about the venue or the personnel until you got to the next county over.

183
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Yeah. If you're on the road, that's a good that's a good rule.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Right. There is like some there is like some universally acknowledged like five blocks, ten blocks, something like that.

185
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Even then, that always scares me because I because I go into a restaurant.

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I'll go. I'm the guy that goes into the restaurant like 20 miles away and goes like, holy shit, that venue was terrible.

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And then I hear from the next table over like, oh, you were at that venue. I do the tickets for that. Exactly.

188
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Yeah. Well, I thought they wanted to hear the reactions to the show and reactions to people hearing me pee as well.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 So I'm fighting it. I'm fighting a UTI and I'm just it's just a lot like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Did someone bring a bean filled horse cock into this bathroom?

191
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 All I hear is plops and drops. Good God.

192
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 You know, you should drink some cranberry juice.

193
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Yeah, man. Clear that shit up. That's disgusting.

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Look, everyone's leaving the chat. Everyone's.

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 That did it. That did it.

196
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Matt is beans.

197
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So I I go downstairs and I finish peeing in the toilet.

198
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 This is after the show is done.

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 After this one. Yeah, I saw one more to go. So I'm like, oh, I'm on a break. OK.

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And a guy just goes like, oh, you should say now they can get into the magic circle.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 There you have a closing joke for your show. OK, I go.

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Oh, I go. What is that?

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It's like I'm already. So so to catch people up, I was hosting a show that the show was having any mixed reactions.

204
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Some people love it. Some people hated it. And I was not necessarily like a good fit, I thought, for the show.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So I just felt awkward hosting it. And so right.

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 But it was a big magic convention and it was a big deal to be asked.

207
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And so I am just trying to process those feelings.

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 But I'm but I'm five of six shows and I'm just like I just want part of me just wants to be over already.

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Right. Yeah. And so to catch people up from the last one, you said the show was more out there than you were really expecting it to be.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And probably more out there than maybe anybody was really expecting it to be.

211
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I spent a lot of it to be out there, but it was they all had kind of like a chill and cerebral vibe to it.

212
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 That's what I wasn't expecting. It was tough coming out to try to be the funny, funny comedian.

213
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Nobody wanted a wacky host in between these rights. Right.

214
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And that's all I'm good for, guys. Yeah.

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And again, like I don't even want to blame circumstances. I thought I also was doing just an OK job myself, like just personally.

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I just thought I could have been doing a better job than I was doing. Right.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And so it was a bit of an uphill battle, though, from the start.

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Yeah. And so I literally like have no patience. I go like I go. What?

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And he goes, no, you say you have a joke for the end of the show.

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 You say, now you get the magic circle. And I go, I don't understand that joke.

221
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 That's not a joke. I just looked at him point blank as I don't understand that joke.

222
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Simply not a joke. And he goes, the last guy was doing a very comedic version of a Cups and Balls routine.

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And so and he goes to get into the Magic Circle in England.

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 It's the big organization in England. Right. You have to audition with the Cups and Balls.

225
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 You can't get into the Magic Circle unless you can do Cups and Balls.

226
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 OK, I consider myself somewhat in the magic world. Blah, blah, blah.

227
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Whatever. Yes. I've never heard that before in my life.

228
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 That is fucking baseball. Right. No, this guy's on to it.

229
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Here's how you deliver it, Matt. Fine. All right.

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 That last routine was awesome. Now you can get into the Magic Circle in England,

231
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 because as we all know, get into the Magic Circle in England.

232
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 You have to present the Cup and Balls trick. Good night.

233
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 That's a perfect topper. It's kind of like my closer joke. Yeah.

234
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 That was my last joke, everyone. That's my closer.

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So he said, OK, I'll use that joke like that. Yeah.

236
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 So I felt bad of being addicted to this socially awkward person.

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's a magic convention. I should have more empathy.

238
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Everybody there is socially awkward.

239
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Should you, Matt? You're too close to the flame right now.

240
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You don't remember how magicians need to be ostracized.

241
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 But this is just... Natalie, he's got a point.

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 This is just the prelude. This is not the story.

243
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I do love, in this prelude, I do love when civilians catch you in your blank face.

244
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Matt will go into that moment where he just can't talk to you for a minute.

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Just give him a minute now. And then when people go up and talk to him,

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 it makes me laugh every time.

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Because my comedy entertainer self is the shell I've put over this bitter asshole

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 who growing up without comedy was an angry, bullied jerk.

249
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So it was only through comedy that I found a way to be palatable in this universe.

250
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And so sometimes I go back to that kid that just wants your lunch money if you talk to me.

251
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And I have to walk away. I have to recalibrate.

252
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Oh, man.

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I just need a second.

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I need a second. I know who I am right now. And you won't like me.

255
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I'm aware. It's not that I'm unaware. I am aware. That's why I'm taking this walk.

256
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Yeah, yeah. But a closing joke.

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Behind him is some guy. He's like aggressively drying his hands with paper towels.

258
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And he's wearing like a drippy t-shirt. He does not look like a magic attendee.

259
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 He's not well put together.

260
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 What's that? What do you mean a drippy t-shirt?

261
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Like he's he is like a skinny person and he's wearing like a large t-shirt that is like hanging off of him.

262
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 It's like he's very much draped and not wearing the shirt.

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And he's a Vegas local. So he looks a little messy.

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 His outfit is not bespoke.

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 No.

266
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And he says, he says, you know, as funny as most people don't even know where the suits of the cards come from.

267
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, my goodness sakes alive.

268
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You're right. That is funny.

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 That's it. That's it. Boy, that right there. That's a joke.

270
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Finish it out like that. That's my closer.

271
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 One last funny thing, folks.

272
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 A lot of people don't even know where the suits of the cards come from.

273
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And so I ignore him.

274
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Now you can join the magic circle.

275
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 You ignored him. Good for you.

276
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And I try to walk out and he stays over my shoulder.

277
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Oh, he's following you, telling you the story of the of the suit.

278
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And he goes one more time, it's because most people don't know where the suits of the cards come from.

279
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Now, I will tell you, in this moment, my brain is going through multiple things and I I literally go like, oh, I literally go in my mind.

280
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Oh, no. Is there religious connotations to the suits of the cards?

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Because that's the way this guy is aping me. I was like, this is not right.

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 He's not trying to fun fact me.

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 No, he's trying to set you up for a Bible. He is giving you what?

284
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Circa nineteen ninety four piff the magic dragon routines.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 He's about to bust out Christian card magic.

286
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. The three silks are the father, son and the Holy Ghost.

287
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Look at this glass of filthy water. You would never drink this glass of filthy water.

288
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 But you bring in the Holy Spirit with the cross cleaned up.

289
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And notice, I'm still not going to drink, still not drinking.

290
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's still horribly poisonous.

291
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's just clear now. So again, I'm in a mood and I don't want to be.

292
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Yeah. So I stopped dead in my tracks and turned to him and I go, go ahead.

293
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Hit me. I go ahead and he recoils an offense that I've said, go ahead.

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Because I basically I don't want to say I'm curious as I'm not.

295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Right. Yeah. It's like, you know exactly how curious you are.

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 You and Google could provide me the same information right now.

297
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And I want to talk to one of you.

298
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 You and Google can both provide me the same information that I don't care about.

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 He goes, oh, well, I didn't realize, you know, you're going to be so sour about it.

300
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 I don't know if we have to get into it or whatever.

301
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 We're in the fucking bathroom, man. And I go, well, then we don't.

302
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And so he huffs ahead of me and turns right out of the bathroom.

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 All right. Yeah. So I go left.

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And for people who've been to Scoop Fest or in the Orleans before,

305
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 knows that this bathroom is right outside the Keno station.

306
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 When you walk into the Orleans, it's the Keno thing.

307
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I know what you're talking about now.

308
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So it turns out my man is just a Keno player.

309
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 So even though he went right, he just circles back

310
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and just weaves back through the chairs towards me

311
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 and is mouthing off about me out loud as he parades through the Keno chairs.

312
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 I was just going to tell this guy about the different suits of the cards

313
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 and where they come from. He doesn't want to hear about it, though.

314
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I don't know what his problem is.

315
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I was going to tell him about the hearts of the diamonds, the spades of the clubs.

316
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And people don't know about the frogs. That was the fifth suit for a while.

317
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 But I was going to tell him all about that stuff. He didn't want to hear it, though.

318
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I guess I'm going to play Keno. Bingo. Shit. Wrong game.

319
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 See, I'm throwing off my game now. I mean, you're 90 percent.

320
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Yes, Jacob. Yes, it's exactly what's happening.

321
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And I don't know why I stopped. I don't know why I should just kept walking.

322
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Oh, buddy. Oh, but I stop and go like, what is your problem, man?

323
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Yes, my problem. What is your problem? You're the one being a jerk. I go.

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Oh, because you're being nice. Is that what it is?

325
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 I'm a jerk while you're being a very nice person.

326
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You just want to tell me your fun facts.

327
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Tell me your fun facts. You know, man, I don't need to do that, whatever, man.

328
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And he goes, he goes, no, you can go off, you go off, do your thing, man.

329
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 He goes, I'll see you at the throne.

330
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Ah, it was religious. And so I go, what? Oh, I go, what?

331
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And he goes, nothing, man. I go, no, what did you just say?

332
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 What was the statement you just made? And he goes, no, nothing.

333
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I go, no, you said something about a throne. What did you just say?

334
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And he said, I'll see you at the throne.

335
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It means that when we are done with the life that the Lord gave us,

336
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 we meet at the throne to figure out how we spent our lives.

337
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You and I specifically meet at the throne?

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Nothing better than a heartfelt evangelical moment

339
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 from a degenerate gambling piece of shit in Las Vegas.

340
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 That's what I said. I go, oh, that's you being nice.

341
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And he goes, yeah. I go, really? And then I step right into space.

342
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And I go, so when you and your friends part ways,

343
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 you guys go see you at the throne and you high five and you walk away.

344
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Everyone just says see you at the throne when they get in their car and drive away.

345
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Everyone just saying see you at the throne all the time.

346
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I go, are you just being a condescending dickhead? Yeah.

347
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 He's saying see you when you die is what he's saying. That's what he's saying.

348
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I'll see you when you're dead, fucker. I'll see you when you're on your way to hell.

349
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 I'll see you from heaven. Yep.

350
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I'll be in the throne sitting on daddy Jesus's fat lap.

351
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Leon thought that the throne was a gay bathroom thing.

352
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Leon, it would have been better.

353
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 A gay bathroom thing would have been a great surprise here.

354
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Yes, correct. I would have actually been much happier if he was like,

355
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I'll see you when you take a shit. Like, that's right.

356
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I'll follow you. I'm going to follow you to the bathroom.

357
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Everyone's got to go sometime and just when you least expect it.

358
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Elvis was the king.

359
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I saw you eating that protein bar earlier. Yeah, it's good coming in.

360
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 It's rough coming out.

361
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And I was like, there's a little voice, a voice, a sane voice in my head.

362
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 It was like, why are you still here? What are you writing?

363
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 What are we doing?

364
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And then one of my friends was like, if you get kicked out of the Orleans.

365
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 For arguing with a crazy Christ.

366
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 If you get 86 from the Orleans for this, Matt, I am going to be angry with you.

367
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I was like, it would be the only thing people were talking about in Magic Live

368
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 is that the host of the show got kicked out for fighting a crackhead religious person.

369
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And then, and then the scoop fest is at the Orleans, so I can't get banned from the Orleans.

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I can't get 86 from the Orleans.

371
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And so I did walk away, finally.

372
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 No, Dan Lazlo, Dan Lazlo in the chat says scoop fest live from the Orleans parking lot.

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 When they 86 you can't be in the parking lot either.

374
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Yeah, it's got to be from like the Chevron. Yeah, across the street.

375
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 In view of the Orleans, scoop fest 2025.

376
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 We really have to pull our weight with fucking.

377
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 McMillan's. Yeah, McMillan's. Oh, yeah.

378
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 We'd have to be like, please, McMillan's, please.

379
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 The alcohol free Irish bar.

380
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 You know who else is as successful as an alcohol free Irish bar?

381
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 That's the following sponsor.

382
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 The show is brought to you by.

383
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Customs scrotal implants.

384
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 That's right from scoop of Henny or scoop of Henley.

385
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Sorry, scoop of Henley in 2022.

386
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 That's custom scrotal implants.

387
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages.

388
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Welcome to custom scrotal implants.

389
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 The only amusement park dedicated to fake balls.

390
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 That's right. Yes, come on in.

391
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Come on in.

392
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 We've got nothing but food rides and shows dedicated to false testicles.

393
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Yep. We have the ball buster.

394
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Our number one roller coaster in the nation.

395
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 An 800 foot drop with no seats.

396
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So you rattle your taint right against the floor of the car.

397
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Ow, you're going to need some of our famous fake balls after that.

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 We also have Jimmy yum yums.

399
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Big old buckets of balls that serves nothing but prairie oysters.

400
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 That's right. Go to Jimmy yum yums and get yourself a big old.

401
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Prairie oysters with our patented ball free sauce.

402
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That's right.

403
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It's ball free because there's no balls in it.

404
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Or are there? We don't know.

405
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 We don't even know what Jimmy yum yums is selling.

406
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Honestly, I brought this guy in.

407
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He told me he had prairie oysters.

408
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I took him at his word.

409
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 It's on you and Jimmy yum yum to sort it out.

410
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And don't miss the cavalcade of stars performing in testes one,

411
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 two, three on our big commemorative stage in the Hall of Presidents.

412
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 That's right.

413
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 We talk about all the presidents testicular problems from FDR's

414
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 folded boys that he couldn't ever access because he was constantly

415
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 sitting down to Abe Lincoln's Ring of Ding Dingers that swung like

416
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 the Liberty Bell itself.

417
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 All the presidents testes coming out swinging.

418
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 That's right.

419
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 That's what it's called.

420
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Come out swinging.

421
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 The show is called coming out swinging.

422
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And then the finale, which everyone loves, Gravity Wins.

423
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 That's the finale song.

424
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Gravity wins.

425
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And it's nothing but saggers.

426
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 But guess what, everybody?

427
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 That's what this ballpark is all about.

428
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 This ballpark is dedicated to fake balls.

429
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 So when Gravity does finally defeat your testicular sack,

430
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 you can come here and get what we're really famous for,

431
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 which is ball replacement surgery.

432
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Get your fakeies in there.

433
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 As someone who got ball replacement surgery,

434
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 I can't tell you how fun it is, honestly.

435
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I have my fake tiny balls and I put a bell around my scrotum.

436
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 And now whenever I play with myself,

437
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 people think I'm collecting money for the Salvation Army.

438
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And you might be.

439
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 There's no way to tell.

440
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 When I got my ball replacement surgery,

441
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I had them replace it with those clicky clacky things that are on

442
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 desks in people's offices, you know?

443
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Where like the one ball flies in and it hits the other balls and

444
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 then the one ball flies off the other way.

445
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 That's what I got them to replace mine with.

446
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 It's great.

447
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 When I walk along, I just go click clack, click clack.

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 All kinds of wild, wacky ball replacement stuff.

449
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You can get those kinds that you put on your truck.

450
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 You can get truck nuts put on yourself.

451
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Why the fuck not?

452
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Who cares anymore?

453
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Just go nuts.

454
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Go nuts.

455
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 It's our company slogan.

456
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 That's our slogan.

457
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Go nuts.

458
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Oh, man, I want to scoop baby.

459
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Just turning it out of his seat and he's got a real gamer chair, man.

460
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 He's got a real comfortable gamer chair.

461
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Oh, yeah.

462
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Oh, look, there we go.

463
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 There they are.

464
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 What are you holding?

465
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Oh, proper sack.

466
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 He's dangling his fake balls.

467
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Yes.

468
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I couldn't remember.

469
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I need to get Jacob to the internet.

470
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 If you wouldn't mind.

471
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 All right.

472
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Is there a name for when dogs get neutered?

473
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 They have fake balls that you can implant on your dog so they don't feel so emasculated?

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 All right.

475
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Are they called like nudicles or something like that?

476
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Or, or nexticles or fake stickles?

477
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 There's some.

478
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Is it?

479
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Nutri, neuter calls.

480
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 That's it.

481
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Neuter calls.

482
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 That's when they get neutered, neutered calls.

483
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That's the new name of this podcast is neuter calls, neuter calls.

484
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 They're called these nuts.

485
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 You're right.

486
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Newticles.

487
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Yeah.

488
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Newticles.

489
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 All right.

490
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Newticles.

491
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 That was the one I was searching for.

492
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 But I was like, it can't just be newticles.

493
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 But I guess it is newticles.

494
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 I guess it is.

495
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 All right.

496
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Yeah, that's all.

497
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 What was the story you wanted to get into before we got on air?

498
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Oh, well.

499
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 So for those of you who may not know, America is in steep decline and it's being helped

500
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 along by a bunch of Gestapo bastards called ICE.

501
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And unfortunately, you guys know how many times I've lamented the options that we have

502
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 here in beautiful Allison Park PA for eating.

503
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 That's right.

504
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 At least 12.

505
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Right.

506
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 So one of the places that Anne and I have frequented over the years has been a Mexican

507
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 restaurant, Emiliano's.

508
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,200
 And they have a couple of locations around this area and it is one of our favorite spots

509
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,680
 to go to.

510
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,560
 We've been like probably 40 times, I would imagine.

511
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:46,200
 Yeah, we go there fairly frequently as far as stuff goes.

512
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,100
 Their owner was in Florida, I believe it was Florida, was away.

513
00:33:52,100 --> 00:34:01,460
 She was overseeing her son's graduation and gets an emergency phone call that there's

514
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:10,300
 an ICE raid at the restaurant and comes back to people missing.

515
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,940
 There's video of they just ransacked the restaurant.

516
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,260
 Like there are ceiling tiles all fucked up.

517
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,940
 They started a small fire in the kitchen.

518
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,440
 There's just shit all over the floors.

519
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
 It's insane.

520
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,740
 It looks like somebody came in and robbed the place, which essentially they did.

521
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:35,840
 And it just feels so deeply wrong and illegal that I'm just beside myself thinking that

522
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:44,640
 these are government authorized agents acting supposedly in the name of the people of Pennsylvania.

523
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,000
 It's just fucking sick.

524
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:59,980
 And it's so frustrating that anyone who's in this country that wasn't born here is considered

525
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,440
 a criminal at this point, even if they have paperwork and stuff.

526
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,340
 Even if they're trying to get things done properly.

527
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:19,340
 And there's a naivete, I guess, an ignorance of basically how much we rely on illegal immigrants

528
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,300
 in this country.

529
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,860
 We have been relying on people who have snuck into this country for many, many facets of

530
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,100
 our economy for a very long time.

531
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,660
 For generations.

532
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:38,340
 And the majority of them are not criminals besides that one aspect we just discussed

533
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,440
 of sneaking in here.

534
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,980
 And yeah, it's just not...

535
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:53,460
 But even that, the criminality behind that, and we've discussed this before, asylum seekers,

536
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,100
 which until the person who runs the government didn't understand the difference between asylum

537
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,940
 and insane asylum got into power because that's what he honestly thought.

538
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,140
 That was his insane thing.

539
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,420
 He thought asylum seekers were people who were from insane asylums.

540
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,660
 He doesn't understand what the term asylum means.

541
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:22,460
 Anyway, that's a whole nother kettle of fish, but it's just so fucking crazy.

542
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:31,300
 And illegal or not, quote unquote, illegal or not, this is fish in a barrel type shit.

543
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:42,900
 There is no actual seeking down these drug runners or sexual predators.

544
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,500
 This is where the Democrats have fucked it all up too.

545
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,180
 Of course we don't want drugs or more drugs or violent criminals or any of that in our

546
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
 country.

547
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
 Oh, yeah.

548
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,020
 I don't want violent criminals in our country.

549
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
 Nobody does.

550
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,180
 Nobody wants that.

551
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:07,180
 But you want is a way for the government to step up and figure out who is those people.

552
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,380
 And you don't do that by ripping families apart that have been here for decades.

553
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,380
 No.

554
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,500
 Multiple generation families that have been here for decades.

555
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:21,600
 Yeah, if your first line of attack is the Home Depot parking lot and Mexican restaurants,

556
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,400
 you ain't going after shit.

557
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,980
 That's just the stupidest fucking thing.

558
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,880
 And my only hope is that we get this turned around somehow and that there are any legitimate

559
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,300
 courts left to fix this.

560
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,220
 Well, you know who stepped up to help this situation?

561
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,220
 Who is helping?

562
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,420
 We need a hero.

563
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,420
 We do.

564
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,620
 Dean Kane.

565
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
 Dean Kane.

566
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,620
 Right.

567
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
 Right.

568
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
 Superman has stepped in.

569
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,340
 The 90s Superman has announced that he is joining ICE.

571
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
 Yep.

572
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,700
 As if the show "Mashes of Illusion" on the CW couldn't get any grosser.

573
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,020
 Well, he's outdone himself for the Superman curse.

574
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,700
 He's clearly the worst example of the Superman curse.

575
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
 Yeah.

576
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
 What is the Superman curse?

577
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,500
 It's notoriously that the people who have portrayed Superman have had very rough ways

578
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,220
 to go of it in their later life.

579
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,220
 Yeah.

580
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
 Who was it?

581
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
 The first guy...

582
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
 Christopher Reeve was fine.

583
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
 George Reeves.

584
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
 Yeah, yeah.

585
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,220
 No, he didn't.

586
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,220
 Nothing happened to him.

587
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,220
 He was fine.

588
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
 Yeah, you're right.

589
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
 He was fine.

590
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
 That's a fellow with some good old horse sense right there.

591
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
 No, they're all...

592
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,940
 They all have tragic things, but this is the worst.

593
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,660
 This is clearly the worst.

594
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
 This is fucked up.

595
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,000
 Christopher Reeve just hoofing it through life.

596
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 But it is like...

597
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 This is like...

598
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,460
 I don't understand the way ICE is operating to go like, "Oh, yeah.

599
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,780
 I got to get in on that.

600
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
 I got to get in.

601
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
 I got to be a part of that."

602
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,580
 Well, he's following the playbook from...

603
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,900
 Oh shit, what's his name?

604
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,660
 The action star, the Aikido guy...

605
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
 It's Steven Seagal.

606
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,660
 It's Steven Seagal to the next level.

607
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,660
 Yes.

608
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,660
 Yeah, he's following...

609
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,740
 Because remember when Steven Seagal was doing the cop reality show?

610
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
 Yeah.

611
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,340
 They made him like an honorary sheriff in town.

612
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,180
 He was like roughing people up on TV and everything, and they were like, "Shit, this is getting

613
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
 too much."

614
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,260
 Bounty hunting and all that kind of shit, and then he moved to Russia.

615
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,260
 What a fucking joke.

616
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
 Yeah.

617
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
 Yeah, yeah.

618
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
 Jurassic scoop.

619
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
 He's starting from Superman to Homelander.

620
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
 There it is.

621
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
 There it is.

622
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,260
 It's not a far leap.

623
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,420
 It's not a far leap if you're not careful.

624
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
 Homelander's at least funny though.

625
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,140
 Dean Cain is not funny.

626
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,900
 I haven't listened to the dollop in a while, but the dollop they did on Steven Seagal is

627
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,260
 outrageous and amazing.

628
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
 It is worth-

629
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
 I can't imagine.

630
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
 It is worth it.

631
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,500
 If you have a podcast or a video or whatever that you're like, "I want Jacob Smith to

632
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,420
 watch this," just start off by telling me about Steven Seagal.

633
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,980
 If you just start your whole thing by telling me some ridiculous thing that Steven Seagal

634
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,900
 did in 1996, I am in for your entire show.

635
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,500
 Before he hit at all, before he was famous at all, he had three different wives in three

636
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,460
 different countries before he even-

637
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
 Yeah.

638
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
 He was already a fucking-

639
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,140
 Motherfuckers got shit going down.

640
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
 Yeah.

641
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,660
 That guy was just a disgusting narcissist from the jump and-

642
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
 Yes.

643
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,660
 Yeah, yeah.

644
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,260
 But he's hilarious to me.

645
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,060
 That crazy karate bullshit stuff where he's sitting in a chair and people come up to him.

646
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,060
 He's like, "Whoa, whoa."

647
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,060
 Yeah.

648
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,060
 He says he's an Aikido master.

649
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,060
 Yeah.

650
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
 He's a something all right.

651
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,780
 I mean, Dean Cain thing, we talked about this before in the pod, which is if you're an actor,

652
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,620
 these actors keep making themselves prominent in these different movements and stuff like

653
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
 that.

654
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
 Right.

655
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,140
 And it's because all you want, your dream is to be told what to do.

656
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,580
 That's what your job is as an actor.

657
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,580
 When you dream of being an actor, you dream of being handed something and being like, "Become

658
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,060
 this," and then having a director direct you to do stuff or whatever.

659
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:59,380
 And so yes, it seems like Dean Cain having, hosting 13 episodes a year of Master's Illusion,

660
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,580
 not enough for him.

661
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,700
 And so he needs something to do.

662
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
 He needs to be told.

663
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,260
 Well, I mean, it does speak to the travails of Hollywood right now.

664
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,740
 It's hard to find work.

665
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,380
 So you know.

666
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,580
 It's especially hard to find work if you're Dean Cain.

667
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,260
 Oh, for fucking sure.

668
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
 For fucking sure.

669
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
 Yeah.

670
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
 Yeah.

671
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
 Yeah.

672
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,260
 Yeah.

673
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,260
 Yeah.

674
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,260
 When you've burned every bridge you've ever encountered.

675
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
 Right.

676
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
 A lot of...

677
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
 Yeah.

678
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
 Nobody's knocking on Dean Cain's door.

679
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,980
 There's a lot of people who swing their politics the other way because they're blaming Hollywood

680
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,980
 for their misfortune.

681
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,980
 Of course.

682
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,100
 They're saying they're ostracized before they're ostracized and then they double down on politics

683
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,940
 so they can claim that they're victims of something instead of just, "It's really fucking

684
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,140
 hard to maintain a career.

685
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,180
 It's really hard to be an actor for a very long time.

686
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,700
 It's really hard to be in more than one hit thing."

687
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,380
 It's just hard.

688
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,900
 I consider myself extremely fortunate and basically an outlier to have made as much money

689
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,620
 professionally performing as I did for as long as I did.

690
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:08,060
 That's just ridiculous and I'm grateful for that time, very grateful for that time.

691
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,460
 I'm hoping maybe it swings back again one of these days or something, but this is such

692
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,460
 a wonderful outlet.

693
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,620
 I'm so grateful for this, having this opportunity too.

694
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:22,180
 But yeah, it's incredibly hard and if you can't just straight up say, "Well, due to

695
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,660
 some circumstances that are in my control and some circumstances out of my control,

696
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,060
 I just don't have the same career that's happening."

697
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,040
 By the way, you can outrun Dean Cain.

698
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,540
 That guy is a little long in the tooth.

699
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,740
 He's older than you think.

700
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
 Yeah, no.

701
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
 He's an old guy.

702
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,740
 Oh, yeah.

703
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,140
 Him joining ICE is helping no one.

704
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,140
 That's not...

705
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,140
 No.

706
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
 Let's also be clear.

707
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
 Well, ICE is helping no one.

708
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,700
 Well, that's the ultimate thing that really just broke my heart today is that Emiliano's

709
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,340
 has set up a GoFundMe page to try and help the families that are being...

710
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
 Legal defense.

711
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,060
 Yep, legal defense, and to help rebuild their trash restaurant.

712
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,060
 Jesus Christ.

713
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
 Right.

714
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,060
 It's fucking insane.

715
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,480
 But they're already over 40 grand in 24 hours.

716
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
 And that's just like...

717
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,780
 But that's exactly the point is these people are in the communities.

718
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
 They are functioning in the communities.

719
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
 Absolutely.

720
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
 They are loved in their communities.

721
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,300
 They make their communities better.

722
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,180
 We have to find a way to honestly assess what's happening with these families on an individual

723
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,460
 level and how they impact their community, and we have to find a way on a governmental

724
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,460
 level to give credit where credit is due.

725
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,540
 The Statue of Liberty tells us who we want coming to the country, and nobody fucking

726
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
 is down anymore.

727
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,580
 I bet you that preamble's been eliminated on the government website.

728
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,940
 I bet you can't find it on the website.

729
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,660
 It very well may have been rubbed out at Ellis Island, for all I fucking know.

730
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,220
 They may have sandblasted that shit.

731
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,220
 Statue of Liberty's on Liberty Island, not Ellis Island.

732
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,700
 No, but yeah, you know what I'm saying.

733
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
 Yes.

734
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
 Yeah, yeah.

735
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
 But isn't that on Ellis Island, too?

736
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
 They're all gone, Jacob.

737
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,700
 All the islands are gone.

738
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
 No, no, no.

739
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,380
 By the way, that was the most ready Rich I've ever felt doing a podcast.

740
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,380
 That's fine.

741
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,380
 Just getting it correct on one quick little thing.

742
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,380
 Yeah.

743
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,380
 Very happy with that.

744
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,380
 That's fine.

745
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,380
 Isn't that saying on Ellis Island, too?

746
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,380
 It might be.

747
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,380
 I have to find out if this comment is true or not.

748
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,380
 Jurassic Excuse says they rubbed one out on Ellis Island, and I've got to know if that's

749
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,380
 true.

750
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,380
 Hold on.

751
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,380
 I'm checking the records.

752
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,380
 I've got to know.

753
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,500
 That was like a bad class trip.

754
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:26,120
 What are we talking about, Jurassic Scoop?

755
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,120
 Where are you?

756
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,600
 Show yourself.

757
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,740
 I think Jurassic Scoop just masturbated at Ellis Island.

758
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,740
 Yeah.

759
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:40,060
 Jurassic Scoop is saying they were at a fair in Wisconsin having some fried cheese.

760
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
 Okay.

761
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,060
 Yeah.

762
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,060
 I'm just curious.

763
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,020
 I'm just curious what would motivate someone to rub one out at Ellis Island.

764
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,020
 That's all I know.

765
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,020
 I'm just curious.

766
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,020
 Hot immigrants.

767
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,020
 It was just a bad joke.

768
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,020
 He's saying it's a bad joke.

769
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,020
 Sexy immigrants.

770
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,020
 Yeah.

771
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,020
 Yeah.

772
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,020
 Yeah.

773
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,060
 I mean, inside my balls is the whole of mastering to be free.

774
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,060
 For that joke.

775
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,580
 That's just how it goes.

776
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,100
 You better rub one out right now.

777
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,940
 Have the courage to man up and be the bit.

778
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,860
 Not on Twitch.

779
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,540
 Don't do it on Twitch.

780
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,660
 Not on Twitch.

781
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,640
 So anyway, just if you happen to be around the Pennsylvania area and you're seeing Emilianos,

782
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,560
 go and frequent them.

783
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
 Give them some business.

784
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
 Give them some money.

785
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,140
 Give them some love.

786
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,140
 Yeah.

787
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,380
 Just, yeah, fuck this shit.

788
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,620
 This is fucking gross.

789
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,500
 The poem, The New Colossus, which is the poem that you're referring to, Paul, that gave

790
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,940
 me your, you're tired, you're weak, all that stuff.

791
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,060
 That is on the, it is inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.

792
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,060
 Right.

793
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,380
 According to the U.S. National Park Service.

794
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,380
 Okay.

795
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,860
 So that is on Liberty Island.

796
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,140
 That's on Liberty Island, not Ellis Island.

797
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,140
 Got it.

798
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,140
 Got it.

799
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,140
 Got it.

800
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,780
 Ellis Island is where the immigrants would come and do the processing and whatnot.

801
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,780
 Right.

802
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,900
 Where you change your names.

803
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,900
 That's right.

804
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,500
 I have the copy of my great-grandfather, my dad's grandfather.

805
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:10,700
 I have the copy of the Ellis Island form that he filled out when he entered the country.

806
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,700
 Wow.

807
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,700
 Yeah.

808
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,820
 You can apparently request these through Ellis Island.

809
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:21,580
 It has a picture of the ship that he came in on and the information they took down from

810
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,580
 him when he entered at Ellis Island.

811
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,240
 And he landed on Smith for a last name, huh?

812
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
 That's right.

813
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
 That's right.

814
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
 All right.

815
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
 Creative guy.

816
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
 Yeah.

817
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
 Yeah.

818
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,620
 I got my creativity from him.

819
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
 Well, you know what?

820
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,020
 I bet back in the day, Smith was probably, Smith was probably a good name to go with

821
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,300
 because you're just like, oh yeah, I'm a Smith, I can do anything.

822
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,300
 I can do it.

823
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,300
 I'm ready for work.

824
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,300
 Everybody knows how to spell it.

825
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,300
 Yeah.

826

1412
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1413
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,660
 Smith.

1414
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1415
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,660
 Smith.

1416
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1417
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,660
 Smith.

1418
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1419
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,660
 Smith.

1420
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1421
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
 Smith.

1422
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1423
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,660
 Smith.

1424
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1425
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,660
 Smith.

1426
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1427
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,660
 Smith.

1428
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1429
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,660
 Smith.

1430
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1431
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,660
 Smith.

1432
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1433
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,660
 Smith.

1434
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,660
 Jack-a-vault.

1435
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:40,660
 Smith.

1436
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,660
 You know, it exists.

1437
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,660
 It's totally real.

1438
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:50,660
 I've got this very emotionally needy ferret that needs attention.

1439
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,660
 It needs medication on the hour every hour.

1440
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:59,660
 My fur baby has the sniffles.

1441
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,660
 Latter-day scoop.

1442
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:07,660
 I think just look at it as more of the social engagement that you'll be gaining from it

1443
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:13,660
 and, you know, don't worry about, I don't know, what is your objective?

1444
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,660
 What are you hoping to get out of it?

1445
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:22,660
 Well, it's something that I chose because, one, it was cheap.

1446
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,660
 Okay.

1447
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,660
 Something I could afford.

1448
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:32,660
 Two, it's sort of in my wheelhouse, but not something I'm great at, that's for sure.

1449
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:38,660
 I'm looking at it as, because everything I know is self-taught, and I went to college

1450
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:45,660
 previously doing multimedia, which included animation and graphics and all of it, and

1451
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,660
 it was just not a good time.

1452
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:54,660
 So, even if I learn nothing, it's not much of an investment put into it.

1453
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,660
 All right.

1454
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,660
 So, at the very least, I'll learn something, hopefully.

1455
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:05,660
 Again, me personally, I would put the emphasis on the social aspect, the fact that you can

1456
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:11,660
 meet some like-minded folks who might be in the same industry, and, you know, I think

1457
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,660
 that's the best that you can hope for.

1458
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,660
 Don't put this on yourself.

1459
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:23,660
 But you might meet someone who you can truly collaborate with, and, you know, I was fortunate

1460
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,660
 enough to have Matt drop into my lap out there in Vegas.

1461
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,660
 Hey, guys, I'm Donnelly.

1462
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,660
 I wish Matt would drop into my lap.

1463
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,660
 Yeah, don't we all.

1464
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,660
 Don't we all.

1465
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,660
 There's a price.

1466
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,660
 But that absolutely changed the trajectory.

1467
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,660
 Preachingfun.com.

1468
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,660
 Preachingfun.com.

1469
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,660
 Matt will drop into your lap for a price.

1470
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:47,660
 Totally changed my trajectory and helped me in a myriad of ways to keep me more creative

1471
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:52,660
 and the opportunities that have come my way because of my association with him.

1472
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:58,660
 So, you know, I think that's key, at least that's been my experience is that it really

1473
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,660
 it's all about networking and getting those those social webs designed.

1474
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,660
 Paul's bringing up something actually pretty significant, which is that you actually might

1475
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,660
 find someone in there that you want to collaborate with.

1476
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,660
 In other words, like that's that would be interesting.

1477
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,660
 All the things that hold you back, you might find someone is like is better at it, right?

1478
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,660
 Like so like if you're not an organized person, you might have someone who's organized but

1479
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
 not funny, right?

1480
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,660
 Or organized but not a good writer.

1481
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,660
 Right.

1482
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,660
 And so like you want to figure out like you basically want to find someone with different

1483
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,660
 superpowers, right?

1484
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:39,660
 And so that might happen through this class.

1485
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,660
 I think these are all good ideas.

1486
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:48,660
 I do think that you shouldn't ignore the idea of that is presented in such classic films

1487
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,660
 like old school and the Rodney Dangerfield film.

1488
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,660
 Yeah, school.

1489
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,660
 I think you should emulate these people.

1490
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
 I'll search out the showers.

1491
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,660
 How should be your heroes?

1492
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,660
 The raging party zone.

1493
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,660
 I think you should endeavor to have your classmates call you old blue.

1494
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:11,660
 I think you should just go with the full bit.

1495
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:18,660
 Old school, old school.

1496
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,660
 That was one of the characters in old school.

1497
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,660
 That's my boy blue.

1498
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,660
 Because in Australia, blue is slang for someone with ginger hair.

1499
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,660
 Oh really?

1500
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,660
 Ow.

1501
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,660
 Yeah, it is.

1502
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,660
 Because you have red hair.

1503
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,660
 What the fuck?

1504
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,660
 It is.

1505
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:36,660
 Like I didn't understand it as a kid and one time.

1506
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
 I don't understand it as an adult.

1507
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,660
 And went to the butchers.

1508
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,660
 I'm like five years old.

1509
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,660
 And the butcher says, oh, good day, blue.

1510
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,660
 And I'm like, what the fuck?

1511
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,660
 Well, I was five.

1512
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,660
 I wasn't thinking what the fuck.

1513
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,660
 I was thinking, this guy has been mean to me.

1514
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,660
 What the fuck did you just say to me, motherfucker?

1515
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,660
 Yeah.

1516
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,660
 So as we're leaving, I'm like, see your sausage face.

1517
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:02,660
 And my mom's like, how dare you.

1518
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,660
 I'm like, I'm just giving it back to this guy.

1519
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,660
 He gave me the business.

1520
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
 I'm giving him the business.

1521
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,660
 It's up there with, hey, buddy.

1522
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,660
 Nice hat.

1523
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,660
 Yeah, it is.

1524
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,660
 See your sausage face.

1525
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,660
 See your sausage face.

1526
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:21,660
 I see a joke about two kids hanging out with the wrong kind of kids.

1527
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,660
 And they've been learning how to curse words and stuff like that.

1528
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,660
 And they just think it's exciting.

1529
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,660
 And wake up in the morning.

1530
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,660
 And mom goes, what do you guys want for breakfast?

1531
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,660
 And the kid goes, I'll take some fucking eggs.

1532
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,660
 And mom just backhands them across the room.

1533
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:41,660
 You don't speak like that in my household.

1534
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,660
 And what about you, little Jimmy?

1535
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,660
 What do you want?

1536
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:52,660
 And he goes, well, I sure as fuck don't want some fucking eggs.

1537
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,660
 Yeah, so I think that's what you need to aim for.

1538
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,660
 OK.

1539
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,660
 Backhand the kids.

1540
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1541
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,660
 Is blue a derogatory term for gingers in Australia?

1542
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,660
 Or is it just a term?

1543
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,660
 No, no.

1544
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,660
 Sausage faces, though, yeah.

1545
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:13,660
 Derogatory is, for me to say, a term for gingers in Australia is ranger.

1546
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,660
 Ranger?

1547
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,660
 Spell that.

1548
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,660
 Ranger, yeah.

1549
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,660
 I'm assuming it's got to do with orangutans or something.

1550
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,660
 Because they have orange hair.

1551
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,660
 I haven't searched the etymology of the word.

1552
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,660
 That sounds right.

1553
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,660
 I think you do.

1554
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,660
 Yet.

1555
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,660
 No, you just hear that when you run, right?

1556
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,660
 Get out of there.

1557
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,660
 Right, yeah, yeah.

1558
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:40,660
 He just hears that word and wants a banana.

1559
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,660
 Well, thank you.

1560
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,660
 Well, thank you, Wayne.

1561
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,660
 Good luck in school.

1562
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,660
 Keep us updated.

1563
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,660
 Yeah, no, thank you for the advice.

1564
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1565
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,660
 Good luck, buddy.

1566
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,660
 Let us know how it goes.

1567
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:55,660
 Form a frat, an awesome party frat headed by just the oldest people on campus.

1568
01:03:55,660 --> 01:04:00,660
 I should make it clear that this is a one night a week, three hours a week course as

1569
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:01,660
 well.

1570
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,660
 Then it's going to be easier to have the frat house.

1571
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:10,660
 They'll never expect that the group at least expects zeta, zeta, zeta to form.

1572
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,660
 Thanks, Wayne.

1573
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,660
 Thanks, guys.

1574
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:21,660
 Let's see, we had Captain James T. Scoop in the chat.

1575
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,660
 Wait.

1576
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,660
 You had a story to tell us.

1577
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1578
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,660
 Go for it.

1579
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,660
 Yeah, you.

1580
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,660
 Yeah.

1581
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,660
 Where are you, Captain James T. Scoop?

1582
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,660
 Let me find you here.

1583
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,660
 There you are.

1584
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,660
 All right.

1585
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:37,660
 So you said you had a story to tell us about the -- you had two stories to tell us.

1586
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:38,660
 Which one's better?

1587
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,660
 Well, actually, well, they're the same story.

1588
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,660
 I just didn't know it.

1589
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,660
 Even better.

1590
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,660
 Just in case my first job --

1591
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,660
 Ha, ha.

1592
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,660
 She got you, Jacob.

1593
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:48,660
 She pitched two stories in the same one.

1594
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,660
 I know.

1595
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,660
 Yeah.

1596
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:51,660
 Perfect, perfect.

1597
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,660
 Yeah.

1598
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,660
 I will stay there.

1599
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,660
 Okay.

1600
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,660
 So, thank you for answering my last email.

1601
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,660
 That was about my grandfather passing.

1602
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,660
 I appreciated that advice.

1603
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,660
 I appreciated that advice.

1604
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,660
 That was really cool.

1605
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:10,660
 So, I mean, he'd already been dead for two weeks, so it wasn't, like, super helpful.

1606
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,660
 No.

1607
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:12,660
 I'm just kidding.

1608
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,660
 That's our brand.

1609
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,660
 We don't want to be too helpful.

1610
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:17,660
 Two weeks?

1611
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,660
 That's pretty good turnaround for a Scoop Mail.

1612
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,660
 That's better for us than it is for Scoop.

1613
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,660
 Actually, you're welcome.

1614
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:24,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1615
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,660
 No, thank you.

1616
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,660
 Better relation never.

1617
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:36,660
 But at the end of that, I mentioned something about a return missionary dating application.

1618
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,660
 Yes.

1619
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,660
 And Matt seemed, like, kind of grossed out by it, right?

1620
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,660
 Like, oh, that's weird.

1621
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:48,660
 I think this is, like, actually an application for will you date me when I get back from

1622
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:49,660
 my mission.

1623
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,660
 Well, Matt was absolutely correct.

1624
01:05:52,660 --> 01:06:00,660
 And I sat and thought about it, and I was like, well, that is, like, fucking creepy.

1625
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,660
 Like, that's not funny.

1626
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,660
 That's weird.

1627
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,660
 And, like...

1628
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,660
 That's what I'm here for.

1629
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,660
 I know.

1630
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,660
 It just got me thinking.

1631
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,660
 Matt Donnelly, not funny, but weird.

1632
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,660
 That's right.

1633
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,660
 Now you can join the Magic Circle.

1634
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,660
 It just got me thinking.

1635
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:23,660
 It just got me thinking about these things that, you know, you do growing up, probably

1636
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:28,660
 in any religion, but growing up Mormon, that don't seem weird, that are weird to outsiders.

1637
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,660
 Yep.

1638
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,660
 So I've got a story for you.

1639
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,660
 July 24th is a state holiday in Utah.

1640
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:47,660
 It's called Pioneer Day, and it's the day that we all celebrate, you know, Brigham Young

1641
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:54,660
 and the early church saints, as we called them, arriving in Utah, right?

1642
01:06:54,660 --> 01:07:01,660
 So, something else that we do for the youth in the church, when I say youth, this is between

1643
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,660
 ages 14 and 18.

1644
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,660
 You do something called Trek.

1645
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,660
 You do it during the summer.

1646
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,660
 Paul.

1647
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,660
 I didn't mind.

1648
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,660
 It's not what you think.

1649
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,660
 Yeah.

1650
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,660
 It's not what you think.

1651
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:17,660
 It'd be a lot cooler if it was, though.

1652
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,660
 Yeah, it would be, yeah.

1653
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,660
 So, I had my Trek experience.

1654
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,660
 I grew up a military brat.

1655
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,660
 We were living in Virginia in the time.

1656
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,660
 Y'all are from the East Coast.

1657
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,660
 You know how crazy humid it gets in the summer.

1658
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,660
 It's, like, disgustingly hot.

1659
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:41,660
 So, the summer before my senior year of high school, I went with my youth group from church.

1660
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:47,660
 We went up to the Marriott Ranch in July, you know, to celebrate Pioneer Day, even though

1661
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:51,660
 we weren't living in Utah.

1662
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,660
 We all had to dress up in Pioneer clothes.

1663
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,660
 Oh, that's great.

1664
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,660
 I'm already happy with this.

1665
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,660
 Slower, slower.

1666
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
 Were there buckles on your shoes?

1667
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:06,660
 Tell me there were buckles on your shoes.

1668
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,660
 My regular, I think I had regular shoes on.

1669
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,660
 I don't remember that.

1670
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,660
 Damn it.

1671
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,660
 But, yeah, I'm right.

1672
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,660
 So, this was, like, a three-day trip.

1673
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:22,660
 We were not allowed to bring anything that the pioneers would not have had.

1674
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,660
 Syphilis.

1675
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:30,660
 So, that's not just, like, phones and, you know, MP3 players or whatever at the time.

1676
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,660
 I mean, that's, like, toothpaste.

1677
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,660
 Yeah.

1678
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,660
 Toothpaste.

1679
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,660
 That's a lot.

1680
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,660
 No.

1681
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,660
 Come on.

1682
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,660
 Disgusting.

1683
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,660
 Yeah.

1684
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,660
 Yeah, I'm serious.

1685
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:47,660
 It's a bunch of 14 to 18-year-old teenagers in Pioneer clothes pushing hand carts on the

1686
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,660
 Marriott Ranch for three days with no deodorant or toothbrushes.

1687
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,660
 I was going to say, it's like, these guys are going through hormonal changes and puberty

1688
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,660
 and everything else, and they already feel horrible about themselves.

1689
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,660
 How can we make them feel even less attractive to each other?

1690
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,660
 We must.

1691
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:06,660
 Did you see Latter-day Scoop posted an image in the chat there?

1692
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,660
 Does that match your experience, James T. Scoop?

1693
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,660
 They're pulling some kind of wagon and mud.

1694
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,660
 Let me see.

1695
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,660
 Oh, it's people, like, strapped up to a wagon and pulling it themselves instead of horses.

1696
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,660
 Yeah.

1697
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,660
 Also, I've got bad news.

1698
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,660
 That's pretty much what they were doing, huh?

1699
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,660
 I've got bad news for you, James T. Scoop.

1700
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:34,660
 So, Brigham Young arrived in Salt Lake City or the Salt Lake Valley in 1847.

1701
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:38,660
 Toothpaste was invented in 1824.

1702
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,660
 They already had toothpaste by then.

1703
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:47,660
 They were just fucking with you and didn't want you to brush your teeth.

1704
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:52,660
 They were lying to you the whole time.

1705
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:57,660
 Couldn't you technically bring, like, golden glasses and a couple of tablets and be like,

1706
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,660
 "Hey, I just read on here that every modern thing is cool.

1707
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:02,660
 It's all good.

1708
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,660
 We can just bring whatever the fuck we want."

1709
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,660
 I should have, right?

1710
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,660
 I should have.

1711
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,660
 No, I've got some invisible tablets here that say tooth brushing is fine.

1712
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,660
 Become a new prophet.

1713
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,660
 Kudos to the rich.

1714
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,660
 I mean, I'm a woman though, so they wouldn't have listened to me.

1715
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:21,660
 Kudos to the rich kid that was like, "I'm bringing a horse.

1716
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,660
 We're bringing a goddamn horse.

1717
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,660
 We're taking care of the horse the whole time."

1718
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,660
 So, is there a start point and destination?

1719
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,660
 What exactly is the...

1720
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,660
 Yes.

1721
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,660
 Yeah.

1722
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,660
 So, there's a place that you start and a place where you end.

1723
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,660
 And so, we get there.

1724
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:40,660
 They go through our bags, make sure we don't have anything we're not supposed to have.

1725
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:41,660
 No toothpaste.

1726
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,660
 My toothpaste.

1727
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,660
 We're dividing into families.

1728
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,660
 You can keep the whiskey.

1729
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,660
 The whiskey existed then.

1730
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:47,660
 Go ahead, here you go.

1731
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,660
 That's right.

1732
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,660
 Right?

1733
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,660
 Yeah.

1734
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,660
 I should.

1735
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,660
 Yeah, right.

1736
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:57,660
 They divide us into families and we're all paired with a married couple that we have

1737
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,660
 to call Ma and Pa.

1738
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,660
 Gross.

1739
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:01,660
 Boo.

1740
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,660
 Boo.

1741
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,660
 Boo.

1742
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:11,660
 Is there a way for Matt, Paul, and I to become one of the people that they call Paul?

1743
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1744
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:16,660
 Can I apply to be a camp counselor at this thing?

1745
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,660
 No.

1746
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:21,660
 I would bring my own fishbone record with that Hey Ma and Pa song.

1747
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,660
 Hey Ma and Pa, what the hell is wrong with y'all?

1748
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,660
 I promise I'll show up with the dirtiest mouth and the stinkiest armpits to apply.

1749
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,660
 Oh, God damn it.

1750
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,660
 Does that help?

1751
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,660
 God.

1752
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,660
 Yeah, totally.

1753
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,660
 That'll get you in for sure.

1754
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:43,660
 Well, you want a side tangent, but for girls camp, the LDS girls camp, they always want

1755
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,660
 priesthood holder volunteers.

1756
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:49,660
 You don't have to have a girl going to the camp to volunteer.

1757
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,660
 Just throwing that out there.

1758
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,660
 Super creepy.

1759
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,660
 Of course not.

1760
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,660
 Oh, he's creepy about that.

1761
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:59,660
 Why doesn't anyone care about young women?

1762
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,660
 But he's got priesthood, so we're good.

1763
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,660
 I like that Chuck E. Cheese literally has better security.

1764
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:11,660
 Chuck E. Cheese literally has better, more guidelines about who can touch the children

1765
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,660
 in their establishment.

1766
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:17,660
 I could be way off base here, guys, but I feel like there could be a correlation between

1767
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:22,660
 these organized religious practices and the fuckery that's going on at the top levels

1768
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,660
 of our government right now.

1769
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:27,660
 I might be missing a beat here somewhere.

1770
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,660
 No, no.

1771
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,660
 Our president has very shiny teeth.

1772
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,660
 He's got some toothpaste.

1773
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,660
 You think those are his real teeth?

1774
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,660
 Fuck off.

1775
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,660
 And do I think he brushed them himself?

1776
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,660
 No.

1777
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,660
 Oh, no way.

1778
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,660
 No way.

1779
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,660
 No way.

1780
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,660
 Certainly not the bottom row.

1781
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,660
 I think he just brushes the top teeth and just ignores everything else.

1782
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:51,660
 That's weirdly horrible.

1783
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:52,660
 Okay.

1784
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:57,660
 If I found out that was true, I feel like that would be the thing that I thought was

1785
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,660
 the worst thing about Donald Trump.

1786
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,660
 I got news for you.

1787
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,660
 Yeah.

1788
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:03,660
 Okay.

1789
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,660
 I'll try to speed this up.

1790
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:09,660
 I'll just mention a few of the most egregious things that happened.

1791
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,660
 Please.

1792
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,660
 All right.

1793
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,660
 Okay.

1794
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,660
 So for the three days.

1795
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,660
 So we start on this handcart trip.

1796
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:23,660
 For lunch that day, we got a cutie, one of those little cutie oranges, and that was it.

1797
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,660
 Jesus.

1798
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:25,660
 I was so hungry.

1799
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,660
 I ate the peel.

1800
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:31,660
 Oh, God.

1801
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,660
 I was so hungry.

1802
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:41,660
 And then for dinner, we got a little 10 cup of broth and a roll.

1803
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:47,660
 And then to sleep in, we got a tarp for the whole family, and we could choose to either

1804
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:52,660
 sleep on top of the tarp or underneath it if it was going to rain.

1805
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:55,660
 Those were our options.

1806
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:59,660
 And this was your real family, or these were the people that you were just instructed to

1807
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,660
 call ma and pa?

1808
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:04,660
 Oh, he was instructed to call ma and pa.

1809
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,660
 Oh, and I was called the big sister.

1810
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,660
 I got nominated to be the big sister, and there was a big brother.

1811
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:16,660
 So you are getting under a tarp with a fake mom and dad and family.

1812
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,660
 Yeah.

1813
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:22,660
 Well, after having a cup full of broth.

1814
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,660
 And a cutie.

1815
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,660
 And a cutie, Matt.

1816
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,660
 I have to tell you, I think the pioneers were better at it than this.

1817
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:34,660
 I just want to say that I don't think -- this sounds like someone who didn't understand

1818
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:35,660
 history.

1819
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:38,660
 I don't know that they were that much better at it.

1820
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,660
 How was this broth contained?

1821
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:44,660
 Was this in a sealed canister?

1822
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,660
 Was it like a soup canister?

1823
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
 What was that?

1824
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,660
 How was the broth contained?

1825
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,660
 Oh, well, no, they made it over the fire.

1826
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:58,660
 Like they heated it up in like a pot and then ladled it into the cups.

1827
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,660
 Okay.

1828
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,660
 All right.

1829
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,660
 Gotcha.

1830
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,660
 So we had to walk along with our little cup and then we had a ladle of broth.

1831
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,660
 What was it made of?

1832
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,660
 It was just like teardrop broth.

1833
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,660
 It was probably just bouillon cubes, to tell you the truth.

1834
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,660
 Right, right, right.

1835
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,660
 Like salty flavored chicken water.

1836
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1837
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:18,660
 Good news, though.

1838
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:23,660
 The orange peel actually has more vitamin C and fiber than the inner fruit.

1839
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,660
 So you did yourself a favor by eating the cutie peel.

1840
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,660
 Well done.

1841
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,660
 You won.

1842
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,660
 You won the game.

1843
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:30,660
 You won the survival game.

1844
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:31,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1845
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,660
 I knew that all along.

1846
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:33,660
 I was just testing you guys.

1847
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,660
 Yeah.

1848
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,660
 I wanted to see.

1849
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,660
 That's the kind of instincts we need a big sister to have.

1850
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,660
 Yeah, exactly.

1851
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:47,660
 You know, I'm bringing I am in real life a big sister, so I'm just bringing that experience

1852
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:50,660
 everywhere I go, you know, bringing that knowledge.

1853
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,660
 Yeah.

1854
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,660
 But a couple other things.

1855
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:57,660
 So one time it was supposed to be a lesson on faith.

1856
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:05,660
 We had to be blindfolded and they would tell us where to go with the cart and guide us,

1857
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:09,660
 you know, with their voices, but the worst one.

1858
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:16,660
 And even at the time, like and I was, you know, I mean, I'm 17, fully in it, fully believing.

1859
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:20,660
 But even at the time, I was so upset at this.

1860
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,660
 They have something called the woman's pool.

1861
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:33,660
 And there was a stretch of time, you know, but there was a time.

1862
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,660
 It's a wagon.

1863
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,660
 It's a wagon washing fundraiser.

1864
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:44,660
 That would have been a lot better.

1865
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,660
 It would have been a lot more fun.

1866
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:47,660
 I'll tell you that.

1867
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:52,660
 But it was supposed to commemorate this time that we're like the men went away to do something

1868
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:56,660
 and the women spent some time with the hand cards on their own.

1869
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:03,660
 And so we were supposed to like it was like in their honor kind of a thing.

1870
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:07,660
 Right. So the boys were not permitted to help.

1871
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,660
 They had to stand on the edges.

1872
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:13,660
 They waited till we got to the steepest, hardest part of the trail.

1873
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:17,660
 Well, it wasn't even a trail, but of our area.

1874
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:22,660
 And that the boys were allowed to do was like fan us with like their hats and stuff.

1875
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:39,660
 And us girls, the women in the women's pool, we had to push the cards up this huge hill all by ourselves while singing hymns.

1876
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:46,660
 And at the end of it, we had like a testimony meeting, you know, where everybody can talk about how amazing and wonderful it was.

1877
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:52,660
 The boys got up and they were like, it was so hard to watch you struggle.

1878
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,660
 It was just so difficult.

1879
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:58,660
 And I can't imagine how those husbands must have felt leaving their wives.

1880
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,660
 I just wanted to help you guys.

1881
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,660
 And I'm like, you little bitches.

1882
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,660
 No, you didn't.

1883
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,660
 You're just glad you didn't have to do the hardest part of the whole thing.

1884
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:16,660
 Do these little Mormon boys think that the Mormon pioneers had just watched and fanned their wives with hats while their wives did all the work?

1885
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,660
 Well, I don't know, man.

1886
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,660
 I don't know.

1887
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:24,660
 But they just kept going off about how like it was so hard for them to watch us struggle so much.

1888
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,660
 And I'm like, I'm sure it was.

1889
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,660
 No, they're the victims in this.

1890
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,660
 Do you understand?

1891
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,660
 It's good to be a lily white Mormon boy.

1892
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,660
 Is there any way that they could have stepped in?

1893
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:40,660
 Was that a possibility that they could step in and just help or they were forbidden?

1894
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,660
 No, they weren't allowed to.

1895
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:46,660
 What do you think would happen if somebody did?

1896
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,660
 Oh, you know, I mean...

1897
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,660
 It'd be at least as bad as drinking coffee.

1898
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,660
 Oh, you think that bad, huh?

1899
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,660
 I think that bad, yeah.

1900
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,660
 Wow, holy shit.

1901
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:02,660
 I mean, I think somebody would have intervened and told them to stop and that they hadn't.

1902
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,660
 I would have stepped in.

1903
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,660
 I would have just been like, man, let's help push this wagon.

1904
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,660
 Also, I would have never done any of that stupid shit.

1905
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:11,660
 Maybe. I don't know.

1906
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:14,660
 I got roped into some dumb shit when I was young, young.

1907
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,660
 But I think I...

1908
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,660
 And we started a podcast.

1909
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:22,660
 It took me to like 20 to really free myself from this shit.

1910
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:26,660
 And even then I was still kind of fucked with it.

1911
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,660
 It's hard.

1912
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:33,660
 I mean, yeah, I started questioning, you know, mid-20s, but then just that fear of like...

1913
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,660
 Right.

1914
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,660
 I don't want to go to hell, you know?

1915
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:37,660
 Yeah.

1916
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,660
 But, you know, it ended up okay.

1917
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:44,660
 We got to kill a chicken and learn square dancing.

1918
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,660
 And then I got my period at the end of it.

1919
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:47,660
 So, you know.

1920
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,660
 See? Pushing that cart uphill.

1921
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,660
 There's a plan for everything.

1922
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,660
 There's a plan for everything.

1923
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:57,660
 Thank you, Captain James D. Scoop.

1924
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,660
 Amazing. Thank you for sharing.

1925
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:05,660
 I killed the chicken because I was the big sister.

1926
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,660
 The big brother had to kill the chicken.

1927
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:12,660
 I was allowed to de-feather it, but I could not behead it because that was a boy's job.

1928
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,660
 But anyway, that's my story.

1929
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,660
 Awesome.

1930
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,660
 Yeah.

1931
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,660
 All right, Captain James D. Scoop.

1932
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,660
 We'll see you at the throne.

1933
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,660
 See you at the throne.

1934
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:24,660
 See you at the throne.

1935
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,660
 Thanks for letting me share, guys.

1936
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,660
 Oh, yeah.

1937
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:32,660
 Also, you look good as a wrangah.

1938
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,660
 Now we've got...

1939
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:34,660
 Thank you.

1940
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:37,660
 Now we've got you in more Australian slang.

1941
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:38,660
 Perfect.

1942
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,660
 I'll say it.

1943
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,660
 I think the Mormons got a couple things wrong.

1944
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:45,660
 I know I don't want to ruffle too many...

1945
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,660
 All right.

1946
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,660
 I don't want to ruffle too many recently plucked chicken feathers, but I think they got a few things wrong.

1947
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:55,660
 Well, we'll see you at the throne.

1948
01:20:55,660 --> 01:21:05,660
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1949
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:18,660
 Time for Chuck vs. Mike.

1950
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:21,660
 I'm chicken feathers.

1951
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,660
 Okay.

1952
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,660
 So I want to scoop, baby.

1953
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,660
 I want to scoop, baby.

1954
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:29,660
 Just put in the chat.

1955
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,660
 Is that going to be a thing?

1956
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:31,660
 The throne thing?

1957
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:39,660
 And I was just thinking, like, we've got I need help salt pork as our greetings.

1958
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
 Yeah.

1959
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,660
 How about as our farewell?

1960
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:46,660
 See you at the cone.

1961
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,660
 That's our new check you later.

1962
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,660
 Huh?

1963
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:51,660
 Huh?

1964
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,660
 Huh?

1965
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,660
 See you at the cone.

1966
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,660
 Approve.

1967
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,660
 We're going to workshop that.

1968
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,660
 Approve.

1969
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,660
 I think it's good.

1970
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,660
 I think it's good.

1971
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,660
 Turn the pages in.

1972
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,660
 Turn the pages in.

1973
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,660
 So all right.

1974
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,660
 Yeah.

1975
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:03,660
 Well, let's just hear from the...

1976
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,660
 Yeah.

1977
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,660
 All right.

1978
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,660
 Love it.

1979
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:07,660
 We'll see how it catches on.

1980
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,660
 See you at the cone.

1981
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,660
 I like it.

1982
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:10,660
 See you at the cone.

1983
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:14,660
 To every Orleans employee you encounter at Scootfest, please end every conversation with I'll see you at the cone.

1984
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,660
 See you at the cone.

1985
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,660
 I think people are down.

1986
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,660
 I think people are down.

1987
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,660
 All right.

1988
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,660
 Thank you for this drink.

1989
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:20,660
 See you at the cone.

1990
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,660
 All right.

1991
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,660
 I'm running.

1992
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,660
 Joe, you could use it.

1993
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,660
 You got to just come out to a Scoop event.

1994
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,660
 Come on out, man.

1995
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,660
 And hopefully there'll be some more Scoop events around the country next year.

1996
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:31,660
 That'd be a great goal.

1997
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,660
 I'm running into a time conflict here.

1998
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,660
 So let's do the...

1999
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:35,660
 Oh, shit.

2000
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,660
 Oh, let's go.

2001
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,660
 We got a Scooper today from Diamond Scoop.

2002
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:42,660
 The categories are Oakland, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Raiders.

2003
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,660
 Paul, you're up first.

2004
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,660
 What do you want?

2005
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,660
 I will go ahead and try Las Vegas for 200.

2006
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,660
 Las Vegas for 200?

2007
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,660
 Everything you think of when you think of Las Vegas, including the Strip and the home

2008
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:57,660
 stadium of the Las Vegas Raiders, is not actually in the city of Las Vegas.

2009
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:02,660
 What is the name of the unincorporated town these attractions reside in?

2010
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,660
 It is known as Paradise, Nevada.

2011
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,660
 Paradise, Nevada is correct.

2012
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,660
 Yeah.

2013
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,660
 Me, I'll try Raiders for 200.

2014
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,660
 Every year there are stupid rumors that the Raiders will trade QB Derrick Carr.

2015
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:20,660
 Oh, this is an older Scooperty from before the Raiders traded Derrick Carr.

2016
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,660
 This is a very old Scooperty.

2017
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,660
 Derrick Carr has already played for the Saints and retired.

2018
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,660
 Yep.

2019
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:32,660
 Maybe they'll stop now that the Raiders traded for this player who is an All-Pro, a Pro Bowler,

2020
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:36,660
 and Carr's former teammate at Fresno State.

2021
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:39,660
 That was shit.

2022
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:40,660
 Adams.

2023
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,660
 Yeah.

2024
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:45,660
 Devontae Adams.

2025
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,660
 Come on.

2026
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,660
 There it is.

2027
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:48,660
 Devontae Adams.

2028
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:49,660
 Nice.

2029
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,660
 Man.

2030
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:51,660
 Matt, you're up.

2031
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,660
 I got to test my vintage Raiders knowledge here.

2032
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,660
 I know, right?

2033
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,660
 Raiders for 400.

2034
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:56,660
 By the way, we could use more Scooperties.

2035
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,660
 Head over to HayScoops.com.

2036
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:01,660
 Just a reminder.

2037
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:06,660
 The Raiders are one of the more mobile teams having played home games in LA, Oakland, Las

2038
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:10,660
 Vegas, and even San Francisco for their opening season while Oakland Coliseum was being built.

2039
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:14,660
 What year did the Raiders move to LA within five?

2040
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,660
 1985.

2041
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,660
 Wow.

2042
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,660
 1985.

2043
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,660
 That's right.

2044
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,660
 That's right.

2045
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,660
 That neighborhood.

2046
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,660
 '82 for sure.

2047
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,660
 You got it.

2048
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,660
 Safe.

2049
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:24,660
 Well done.

2050
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,660
 Paul.

2051
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,660
 Vegas, please.

2052
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:27,660
 Vegas.

2053
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:35,660
 During the last weekend of April 2022, Las Vegas will hold this event with people coming

2054
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,660
 from all over the world to attend the festivities.

2055
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,660
 Oh my God.

2056
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,660
 Was this ScoopFest?

2057
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:46,660
 It might have been.

2058
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,660
 I'm going to go ScoopFest.

2059
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:48,660
 Taylor Swift.

2060
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,660
 Let's try ScoopFest.

2061
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,660
 It was ScoopFest.

2062
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,660
 The NFL Draft does not count.

2063
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:58,660
 Oh, that was the year that we had ScoopFest during the NFL Draft.

2064
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,660
 That's right.

2065
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:00,660
 It's me.

2066
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,660
 I'll try Oakland for 200.

2067
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:06,660
 This former Oakland resident is known for his comedy and political podcasts and his

2068
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:09,660
 very sexy salt and pepper hair and beard.

2069
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:12,660
 He currently resides in Austin, Texas.

2070
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:16,660
 I believe that would be the one and only Justin Robert Young.

2071
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,660
 Yeah.

2072
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,660
 Jury if you're nasty.

2073
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,660
 Jury if you're nasty.

2074
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,660
 Matt.

2075
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,660
 Raiders 600.

2076
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,660
 Daily Double.

2077
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:27,660
 All of it, Jacob.

2078
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,660
 I want it all.

2079
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:36,660
 Raiders legendary owner Al Davis is known for his catchphrase, "Just win, baby," and

2080
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,660
 suing the NFL so he could move to LA.

2081
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:42,660
 Al got his start with the Raiders in 1963 in this position.

2082
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,660
 Doggy.

2083
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,660
 Doggy position.

2084
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,660
 Yes, that's right.

2085
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:52,660
 Oh, it's a Daily Double, so I have to come up with something.

2086
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,660
 Was she the water boy?

2087
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,660
 Was she the guy that brought the waters?

2088
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,660
 What's it called?

2089
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:02,660
 When you collect the uniforms and stuff.

2090
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,660
 Like the equipment manager?

2091
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,660
 Equipment manager.

2092
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,660
 Equipment manager is my guess.

2093
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,660
 Head coach.

2094
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,660
 He would write the head coach.

2095
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:11,660
 Excuse me.

2096
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:12,660
 Jesus.

2097
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,660
 Excuse me.

2098
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:17,660
 The equipment manager for the entire team.

2099
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,660
 The head coach.

2100
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,660
 Equipment, personnel, all of it.

2101
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,660
 Yeah.

2102
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:23,660
 Paul.

2103
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:25,660
 Las Vegas, please.

2104
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:28,660
 The other Daily Double.

2105
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,660
 Not digging it down.

2106
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,660
 Look at you fellas.

2107
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:37,660
 Vegas is becoming quite the sports town, it sure is, with the Golden Knights making the

2108
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:41,660
 Stanley Cup finals in their first year and the Raiders making the playoffs in their second

2109
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,660
 season in town.

2110
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:46,660
 What other major team is rumored to be moving to Las Vegas?

2111
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,660
 The A's.

2112
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,660
 The A's.

2113
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,660
 Let's see.

2114
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:51,660
 It is the Oakland A's.

2115
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,660
 Maybe they'll room with the Raiders again.

2116
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,660
 They are still rumored.

2117
01:26:55,660 --> 01:27:02,660
 I'm actually draining my pool right now because we're going to build a stadium right by backyard.

2118
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,660
 Can you believe all that dirt moving around, bullshit they're doing for nothing?

2119
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,660
 Yes.

2120
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:07,660
 Yes, I can.

2121
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,660
 They can afford it.

2122
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,660
 Yeah, they can.

2123
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,660
 I'm Las Vegas for 800.

2124
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,660
 No, they can't.

2125
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:18,660
 In the year 2281 of the Fallout universe, after the Great War wiped out most of humanity,

2126
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:24,660
 Hoover Dam is the site of much turmoil, as depicted in Fallout New Vegas, two factions

2127
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,660
 fight in the second battle of Hoover Dam.

2128
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,660
 Name one of the factions.

2129
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,660
 Damn.

2130
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,660
 Damn.

2131
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,660
 Damn.

2132
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,660
 Damn, son.

2133
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,660
 I don't have a single idea.

2134
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,660
 I have to pass the mat.

2135
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,660
 Oh, well as a Fallout player, I pass.

2136
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:45,660
 Yeah, but you don't want to reveal the secrets.

2137
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,660
 Yeah.

2138
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,660
 Paul.

2139
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:53,660
 Vault-Tec would be my guess, but I don't have a guess because I don't know.

2140
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,660
 I'll pass.

2141
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,660
 All right.

2142
01:27:55,660 --> 01:28:02,660
 NCR, that's the New California Republic, and/or Caesar's Legion, or just The Legion.

2143
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:07,660
 Hey, Leann Casab, don't type the answers into the chat during the scooper, you jerk.

2144
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:08,660
 Oh, no.

2145
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:13,660
 No, Leann's just too used to us playing our night games.

2146
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,660
 He's playing with me.

2147
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:16,660
 Thank you.

2148
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,660
 Thank you, Leann.

2149
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,660
 I can't see the chat.

2150
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:23,660
 I'm sharing the screen, so I'm not getting the answers.

2151
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,660
 All right, Matt, you're up.

2152
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,660
 Los Angeles, 200.

2153
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,660
 All right.

2154
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:35,660
 LA is the home to a ridiculous number of sports teams, including the surrounding suburbs.

2155
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:41,660
 How many professional teams from the big four leagues currently call LA home, plus or minus one?

2156
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:52,660
 Let's see, we've got the Kings in hockey, Lakers, Clippers, and then we've got the Chargers.

2157
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,660
 There's a WNBA team there, I'm sure.

2158
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,660
 Yeah, but they don't call that part of the big four.

2159
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,660
 Really?

2160
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:02,660
 Big four is basketball, football, basketball, and hockey.

2161
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,660
 Seven.

2162
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,660
 Baseball.

2163
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,660
 Seven.

2164
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,660
 Let's see.

2165
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:08,660
 Eight.

2166
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:09,660
 Wow.

2167
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:10,660
 There you go.

2168
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:13,660
 Chargers, Angels, Dodgers, Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and Ducks.

2169
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:14,660
 Ducks is what I was missing.

2170
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,660
 What's two more if you include MLS?

2171
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,660
 Ah, you didn't have the Anaheim Ducks.

2172
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,660
 No, the Ducks.

2173
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:21,660
 But you got it within one.

2174
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:22,660
 Wow.

2175
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,660
 Paul, you're up.

2176
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,660
 I'll close out Raiders.

2177
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,660
 What the hell?

2178
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,660
 I don't know anything about this.

2179
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,660
 What the hell?

2180
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:34,660
 This head coach led the Raiders to their first Super Bowl win, has the second highest win

2181
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:39,660
 percentage, and revolutionized sports video games by insisting the series with his name

2182
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:41,660
 on it was the most realistically.

2183
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:44,660
 He tragically died in 2021.

2184
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:46,660
 That is John Madden.

2185
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:52,660
 John Madden, of course, the coach.

2186
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,660
 It's me.

2187
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,660
 I'll try.

2188
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,660
 It's a me.

2189
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,660
 It's a me.

2190
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:57,660
 It's a me.

2191
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,660
 Oakland for 400.

2192
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:03,660
 The Oakland Coliseum was the shared home of the Raiders and the A's for many years.

2193
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,660
 In its later years, it was known for the dugouts flooding with sewage.

2194
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:12,660
 What year was the Coliseum built within 10 years?

2195
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:16,660
 Within 10 years?

2196
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:20,660
 Let's try 1980.

2197
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,660
 1966?

2198
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:27,660
 Holy shit.

2199
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,660
 They don't build what they used to.

2200
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:30,660
 They don't.

2201
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,660
 I saw a lot of games in there.

2202
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,660
 It didn't seem that old.

2203
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,660
 Matt.

2204
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:39,660
 Let's do Oakland for 600.

2205
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:43,660
 San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge opened November 12, 1936.

2206
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,660
 True.

2207
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:50,660
 Six months before the Golden Gate Bridge at a cost of $78 million.

2208
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:55,660
 The estimate to replace the Eastern span in 2013 was $250 million.

2209
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:59,660
 With overruns, how much did it actually cost within a billion?

2210
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,660
 Pass.

2211
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,660
 Passes to me, Paul.

2212
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,660
 Matt and I both have zero.

2213
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,660
 I'll take a swing at it.

2214
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:10,660
 I'll say it was supposed to be $250 million.

2215
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:14,660
 I'll say $2.5 billion.

2216
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:18,660
 Good guess.

2217
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,660
 $6.4 billion.

2218
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:22,660
 What the shit?

2219
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,660
 I'll say it.

2220
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:24,660
 That's too much.

2221
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,660
 That's a lot more than I expected.

2222
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,660
 Yeah, it is.

2223
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:33,660
 Paul.

2224
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,660
 That's worse than the sphere.

2225
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,660
 Los Angeles, please.

2226
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,660
 Which is impressive.

2227
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,660
 And 2028, L.A. will tie London and Paris for hosting the most Olympic games.

2228
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:48,660
 Name one of the two previous years L.A. hosted the Olympics.

2229
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,660
 '84.

2230
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,660
 '84, I think that's right.

2231
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,660
 '84 and '32, that is correct.

2232
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:58,660
 Yeah.

2233
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:02,660
 Me, I'll do L.A. for 800.

2234
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:06,660
 In 2022, Will Smith slapped the shit out of Chris Rock during the Oscars,

2235
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:11,660
 held at this theater named after an American company specializing in audio noise reduction,

2236
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:21,660
 audio encoding, compression, spatial audio, and HDR imaging.

2237
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:24,660
 Oh, sorry, that question is directed at me.

2238
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,660
 That's right.

2239
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:29,660
 I was just reading the question and waiting on one of you guys to answer it.

2240
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:31,660
 I believe that is the Dolby Theater.

2241
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:33,660
 Got to be.

2242
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,660
 It is the Dolby Theater.

2243
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:37,660
 I was like, why aren't you all talking?

2244
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:40,660
 The Thomas Dolby Theater.

2245
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:43,660
 Matt, you got it, Oakland or L.A.?

2246
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,660
 If I get both of these questions, I can get in second place.

2247
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,660
 And right now, I'm just in second place.

2248
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,660
 No, I'm in third.

2249
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,660
 I'm in second place, yeah.

2250
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:53,660
 Get 200 points behind me for second place.

2251
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,660
 Oakland for 800 to seal a tie for second place.

2252
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:57,660
 Let's do it.

2253
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:00,660
 According to a random list I found online,

2254
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:07,660
 the ATAT from Star Wars was inspired by the huge four-legged cranes on the port of Oakland.

2255
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,660
 It also says the port is top five in North America.

2256
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:17,660
 What does @@ stand for or what's the largest port in North America?

2257
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,660
 Geez.

2258
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,660
 Matt, there are two very simple questions here.

2259
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:27,660
 You can answer either of them.

2260
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,660
 Artificial testicle, artificial testicle, because it's two balls.

2261
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,660
 Sure, you got that one dead on.

2262
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:33,660
 Yeah.

2263
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,660
 Go for your bonus.

2264
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:42,660
 I thought the largest port in North America was the port of San Francisco, but I might be wrong.

2265
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:45,660
 But I have to guess here because we're at the end of the time here.

2266
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,660
 I'll go with the port of San Francisco.

2267
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:50,660
 All right, let's try it.

2268
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:54,660
 All-terrain armored transport or port of Los Angeles?

2269
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,660
 Port of LA.

2270
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,660
 You're just a little north, just a little north.

2271
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:01,660
 I got all-terrain, but I couldn't put my finger on armored transport completely.

2272
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:05,660
 Paul closing out the category and the game, Los Angeles for 600.

2273
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:08,660
 LA is the home of many conventions and trade shows.

2274
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:15,660
 This trade show covers the video game industry and at one time was the largest gaming expo of the year.

2275
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:18,660
 E3, which no longer exists.

2276
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:23,660
 E3 or Electronic Entertainment Expo, that's absolutely right.

2277
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,660
 It's gone.

2278
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:29,660
 And with that correct answer, Paul just submitted his win with 3,000 points.

2279
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,660
 I'm in second place with 200 points.

2280
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:35,660
 Matt is in a close third with a negative 800 points.

2281
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,660

 We opened up a couple of more whiskey barbecue tickets for Scoop Fest.

2290
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:00,660
 So there are a couple of them there on the website to purchase.

 Come join us here in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada at the end of September.

2293
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:10,660
 My brother's coming.

2294
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,660
 My brother's going to be at the thing.

2295
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:13,660
 Oh, that's fantastic.

2296
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:14,660
 So come and meet my brother.

2297
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,660
 Yeah, yeah.

2298
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,660
 And we're going to do it at the Orleans.

2299
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,660
 Call the Orleans, use our discount code.

2300
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:20,660
 Stay at the Orleans with us.

2301
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,660
 I actually see Akshay Mysore up there.

2302
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:26,660
 I believe he was the first winner of the American Accent contest at Scoop Fest.

2303
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,660
 Yes, I believe he was.

2304
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:29,660
 Akshay, good to see you, buddy.

2305
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,660
 Yeah, thanks for popping on, pal.

2306
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:32,660
 I love seeing Akshay.

2307
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:36,660
 Shout out to Wayne and Captain James T. Scoop for joining us here today.

2308
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,660

2312
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,660
 Oh, right.

2313
01:35:47,660 --> 01:36:05,660
 I forgot I had to hit a button.

2314
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:10,660
 Or if you, like Dead Lazlo in the chat, wonders aloud if Matt Donnelly will still be allowed

2315
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:14,660
 in the Orleans in September, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

2316
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:23,660
 See you at the gym.

2317
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:26,660
 That's fartsinabag.biz, that along with PreachingFun.com.

2318
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:30,660
 It takes you over to our Patreon page, where for as little as $3 a month, you can help

2319
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:31,660
 keep this show on the air.

2320
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:36,660
 If you think this show is worth more than $0, we would certainly appreciate you visiting

2321
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:40,660
 PreachingFun.com and/or fartsinabag.biz.

2322
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:43,660
 You don't really have to go to both, but it couldn't hurt.

2323
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:44,660
 All right.

2324
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,660
 Couldn't hurt.

2325
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,660
 Well, thanks for listening, everybody.

2326
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:47,660
 Stay safe out there.

2327
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:48,660
 We love you and we'll see you at the Cone.

2328
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:49,660
 We'll see you soon.

2329
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,660
 It's just a nice friendly thing that my friends and I say to each other.

2330
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,660
 Anytime we're just leaving the room, we go, "Hey, we'll see you at the Cone."

2331
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:52,660
 What are your favorite songs to play on drums, Keeler?

2332
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:53,660
 Oh, no one else by Weezer, because that's one of my favorites.

2333
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:54,660
 All right.

2334
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:55,660
 Solid choice.

2335
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:56,660
 All right.

2336
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,660
 Let's go.

2337
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:16,040
 We're PreachingFun.

2338
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:25,300
 Come together on the drums.

2339
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:26,300
 Boom-ba-boom.

2340
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,300
 That's the drum solo.

2341
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:31,240
 solo and come together. See ya!
