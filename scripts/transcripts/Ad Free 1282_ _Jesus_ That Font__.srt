 sitting over there in Pittsburgh VA that's Paul Mattingly sitting over in Las Vegas it's Matt

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,620
 Donnelly in Las Vegas as well it's me Jacob the audio guy we're preaching fun uh it's a lot a

13
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,120
 lot like Taskmaster it's I am a huge fan of how did this get made the podcast with Paul Shear and

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,940
 Jason Manzoukas who has done Taskmaster in the past I don't know if he's on this season or not

15
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,020
 that well Jason Manzoukas and I haven't gotten to it I was just informed by a friend but Jason

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,900
 Manzoukas basically wrote them being like why aren't I on this show and like barged this way

17
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,980
 on and got himself invited onto the show yeah uh but it's an English show and you should have

18
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,060
 English comedians or British comedians on there and uh it's just a snarky host

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,840
 and they put people through like random tasks where they have to be very creative or justify

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,560
 their answers it's all very like very funny and I didn't know about the show and turned out a friend

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,080
 of ours their daughter uh was uh I'm being informed that's that's not snarky it's just British uh

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:24,580
 fair enough and uh their daughter was totally into this show and so we uh decided they're

23
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:35,720
 birthday party so what happened was uh uh my kids invited out to California and um and they

24
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,560
 couldn't come without bringing a gift because every on the show every comedian has to bring

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:48,520
 a gift with a certain theme ah and uh the theme had to be uh uh rain and uh sticky was the was

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,560
 the theme of the of the uh so everybody brought her a rain stick an impressive an impressive

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,800
 object it was rain and sticky and someone could have you could have done that but the problem is

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
 if you watch the show if you do something predictable then the snarky slash just British

29
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,080
 host will slam you and not give you points so you have to surprise they'll be British at you

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,380
 and give points and so at first I was like I cannot believe that I'm driving my kids out to

31
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,400
 California and I'm giving them homework right but I started watching the show with my kids

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
 and they haven't seen it either at the prep and the show is really great like it's really funny

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,820
 I'm gonna have to check it out it's it's really great

34
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:35,540
 what gift would you bring under the restrictions of rain oh I I'm glad you asked I already thought

35
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:44,020
 about it I would bring a bottle of pancake syrup that's exactly what I was gonna do I was gonna do

36
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,440
 a Mrs. Butterworth dressed up like a queen oh no no I'm going to have somebody else sit in a chair

37
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,520
 and then I'm going to do a sticky rain on them oh I was going to have the queen

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,080
 the queen Mrs. Butterworth she would have the rain of sticky oh that's good too I like that

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,480
 it's a bit of a pun what about you Matt what did you end up bringing her so I helped my kids out

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,360
 with two different ones my one kid decided to make a fortune telling jar of answers to any

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,500
 questions that he had with a with a fishing pole with a and this the hook was sticky it was a ball

42
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,380
 of sticky tape so great he basically wrote like yes no maybe ask again fill in the blank

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,420
 hell no uh oh he didn't write a whole bunch of like really super specific answers and just drop

44
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,760
 it in there uh no you should not invest in that property yeah and my other kid uh took an umbrella

45
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,780
 wrote the most impressive thing on the umbrella uh with sticky notes and then uh dropped glue

46
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,060
 sticks from strings from each prong on the on the umbrella uh so he opened up the umbrella

47
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,480
 and with that had an umbrella of glue sticks he won he won the challenge with the really with

48
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,360
 the glue stick umbrella yeah he's he's good at a lot of things this was a like 24 hour event

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,840
 this was my friend went way the fuck overboard so uh they were throwing a birthday party for

50
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,360
 their child with all the kids the next day but the chosen five were to be contestants in in in the

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:24,460
 in the contest for the whole day the day before they're doing all of that and then having a

52
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:31,180
 yes i was like that is crazy that's too much you need to have an intervention with these people i

53
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,980
 i was like no one loves their child this much no one no uh so we had our objects i

54
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,980
 load up with all the stuff they needed for their sleepover and they were tasks waiting at the door

55
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,140
 uh before you enter the house so it's like they have these like little ornate envelopes with like

56
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,440
 the red wax kind of sticky on them or whatever and i

57
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,700
 i had two children so they were given two different assignments one was told to enter the house in the

58
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:09,340
 most annoying way please i don't even know i don't even want to know which kid that was

59
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,900
 go on and then the other kid was told enter the house in the smartest way

60
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:23,520
 both kids instantly had an idea great so uh one kid who had the annoying assignment just

61
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,420
 opens door

62
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:33,420
 and goes hey six seven six seven six seven six seven six seven six seven uh and just does it

63
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,280
 and my other kid just threw his stuff at me and ran around the house like went to find another

64
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,900
 way into the house yeah and so i entered behind the kid who got the annoying assignment and said

65
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,280
 you got to go find my other kiddies coming in some other part of your house

66
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,880
 probably good luck to everyone involved

67
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,380
 uh you know they were given like all kinds of crazy tasks and the birthday girl was the host

68
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:09,940
 and the mother was the co-host and they literally uh ran the whole afternoon with games uh and tasks

69
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,280
 for five of her friends to compete in in a contest that took place all day

70
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,540
 you know i'm thinking about i think this is a girl parent versus boy parent difference

71
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,400
 you know i'm thinking about i think this is a girl parent versus boy parent difference

72
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,780
 you say that jacob just but i think it's just a demonstration of how much harder it is to be a

73
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,160
 girl parent than it is to be a boy it definitely is it definitely is different challenges for sure

74
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,080
 i i would say though too like some people birthdays are way more of a thing like with my

75
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,200
 yes wife's family birthdays are big big deal you get to eat wherever you want

76
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:54,380
 everybody has to go along like it's a it's a it's a thing yes my my family wasn't that big

77
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:01,320
 of a all i mean occasionally it would be a big thing when we were little little littler but you

78
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,380
 know it wasn't uh it was in our house it was able to be shuffled around like we still would do like

79
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,640
 a dinner somewhere or some kind of event but it was like hey this brother has a basketball game

80
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,080
 this brother is a football game this was it's like we need to we're gonna do it next saturday

81
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,860
 well especially you got that many siblings too yeah yeah so it was always just a movable thing

82
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,360
 right like we're gonna go have dinner we're gonna we're gonna have a cake

83
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,540
 and candles or something like that some kind of celebration thing and we're gonna do it at

84
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,180
 some point did you have a heavy month matt was there a triple sibling like with my period

85
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,740
 yeah yeah did you have to you know really contain your birthday flow

86
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:47,380
 no we were pretty we're pretty spread out actually with my fam oh that can be a trouble

87
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,880
 with the period too yeah june july we have a june and july we have a june july and august three month

88
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:04,160
 see a doctor see a doctor and then and then uh yeah april december my sister and i are uh well

89
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,640
 we're nine years apart but we're five days apart that was with the only similar birthday okay

90
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,360
 that's what i was wondering yeah yeah but now like when my uh do you know all of your siblings

91
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:22,340
 birthdays i do yeah wow that's why i know no one else's right uh but uh people go like

92
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,320
 something's like i've gotten shit for like not remembering when

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
 someone's birthday is and i'm like man i just have my family and that's enough

94
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,840
 but my when my when my second son was born just two days after my birthday

95
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,620
 i was relieved i was like great we don't have to worry about my birthday ever again

96
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:47,000
 and that can just be his birthday yes i really thought it'd be so cool to have the same birthday

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,460
 but it didn't work out right probably for the best for his own thing but i thought it was awesome

98
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,660
 i mean i think that'd be nice yeah because when he's when he's little you just don't mention it

99
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,820
 right you know like you're at his birthday party or whatever and like you know like it's also my

 i've recently started hiding readers around my house as well uh that just go along with my

162
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,800
 contacts because now my farsightedness is thinking about starting to catch up with my nearsightedness

163
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,380
 which is going real bit real bad for jacob seeing anything hit the tune jacob let's hit the tune

167
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,560
 the kitchen and i'd sit in the kitchen and i'd sit in the kitchen and i'd sit and look at my phone

168
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,740
 there's a pair of glasses yeah look at my phone and then i started uh for directions on stuff to

169
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:36,240
 cook i had this time i was like oh no yep yep damn

170
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,520

171
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,320
 i just have two just just the two around the house well at first uh my and this is really

172
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,800
 fascinating for the listeners but at first like you know obviously reading tiny things was was

173
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,020
 where it started just not being able to look at look at small things um so so did you have the

174
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,760
 same did you have the same reaction that i did when i started to not be able to read my comic

175
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:11,280
 books i was like what the fuck is wrong with this printing yes uh and the same with like macaroni

176
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,580
 and cheese instructions and things like that i'd be like who is this font for what what lilliputians

177
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,300
 are picking up and i'd be like what is this font for what what lilliputians are picking up and i'd be

178
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,280
 like who is this font for what what lilliputians are picking up these boxes this is ridiculous yeah

179
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,220
 and now the problem might be me you see the tv above my head that's the bet that's the tv in my

180
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,340
 bedroom so my um uh i'm further away from the tv than like a regular tv viewing kind of thing

181
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:39,260
 uh now i'm having a hard time uh seeing uh the subtitles on shows i'm watching uh from there so

182
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,520
 now the other side's going too so now it's time it's time that's both ends it's time

183
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,300
 uh but i went right after yeah right after this episode i'm running

184
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,260
 over to pearl vision oh nice yeah so they said yes we can help but not today that's right yeah

185
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,380
 that was let's do it let's do a whole appointment we'll do the whole thing

186
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,220
 which gave me uh some time you know give me some time to think about it and so i started uh

187
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,140
 buying a lot of supplements i've uh off of amazon and i think i spent this time trying to cure my

188
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:17,320
 eyesight train your eyes train your eyes in three days so i can call him back never mind i'm fine

189
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,280
 right as rain

190
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,700
 click i saw some tiktoker he's like problem solved what i tell you about wearing these

191
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,280
 glasses and he's got these glasses that just have nothing but little pinholes in them

192
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,020
 and he's like i wear these and it fixes my eyes i'm like the fuck you do the fuck it does

193
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:44,680
 you lying asshole the uh you hope it does it yeah i understand that you would like it too

194
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,280
 it doesn't know the idea like look i know medical

195
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,180
 costs and medical care in this country is complicated annoying and expensive and everything

196
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,420
 else but the idea that it's a constant just like no we don't want anyone to know that the simple

197
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,780
 blank exists so that we can just rake in the dough on every single ailment that we've come up with

198
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,000
 it's just it's a little much sometimes yes it is it is i don't want to sit around and defend the

199
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,360
 medical industry but i don't think that the whole eye doctor industry is like shit hope they don't

200
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,960
 figure out pinhole glasses that we're doing like yeah my eyes

201
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,820
 here's how bad the the medical insurance here is my eyes are terrible we've talked about that on the

202
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,800
 show before my eyes are horrible uh you've never seen me without contacts or glasses i can't

203
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,160
 function without uh at least one of those things and uh like if this weren't this century if this

204
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,060
 were just a few hundred years ago i would just be dead in the woods somewhere right remember there's

205
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,420
 an old like back like a decade ago an old netflix show i think it was called godless it was a western

206
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,260
 show and it had a guy his glasses broke on that

207
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,880
 like a on the terrain and he's yeah and he spent the rest of the series like not able to see and i

208
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:01,160
 was like holy shit yes i was like oh my god i didn't you don't think about that like my worst

209
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:11,200
 fear on vacation like if i leave town if my contacts or glasses get fucked up yeah i can't

210
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,840
 do anything yeah i'm just i'm just done no you would cut pinholes and two pieces i would cut

211
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,160
 yep you'd fashion a mask

212
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,180
 out of it like a placemat maybe fashion a mask you would tape it to your head that's right that's

213
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:34,600
 right man just pinhole your way around portugal and i'd be fine then i'd be fine but no our our

214
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,000
 insurance is so bad uh like i i have good i have good insurance i have good health insurance i've

215
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,980
 good uh medical and vision insurance and all that kind of stuff there is a surgery that could fix

216
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,240
 my eyes because my eyes are so bad i'm not going to be able to see my eyes because my eyes are so

217
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,300
 bad i'm not going to be able to see my eyes because my eyes are so bad i'm not going to be able to

218
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,420
 see my eyes because my eyes are so bad i can't do like the lasik

219
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,580
 thing and so the surgery is basically a cataract surgery where they they take that lens out and

220
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,680
 they put a corrective lens in in its place and it's just an implanted contact lens is basically

221
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:07,740
 all it is probably safer than lasik maybe i have no idea who knows uh but i i do know what it does

222
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,720
 is is it keeps you from getting cataracts later in life it's also it's also a preemptive surgery

223
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,240
 for cataracts preventative because you're doing the cataract surgery before you have cataracts

224
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:27,460
 smart with my astigmatism i'm very likely to have cataracts they will not pay for that surgery now

225
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,060
 until they will pay for cataract surgery until you get they will not it's not they will they

226
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,620
 will not pay for the surgery that would also correct my vision because that's uh that's an

227
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,760
 elective surgery even though i will almost certainly get cataracts in the future and

228
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,040
 then i'll have to have the surgery anyway yeah it's fucked it's really this is so stupid it is

229
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,220
 it's stupid it's awful i mean well and this is the the kind of obstacles i faced as a man of size

230
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:02,000
 uh trying to address my hip issue for years you know and just being basically you know dismissed

231
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,320
 out of hand by the first guy i went to because the doctor didn't have the appropriate eye

232
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,280
 prescription and couldn't see you well oh he could see me and he was like oh he was like look here

233
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,480
 fatty and i was like motherfucker put these put these pinhole glasses on and you can only eat

234
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,160
 things that fit in the eye and you can only eat things that fit in the eye and you can only eat

235
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,320
 this pinhole i just i'll never get over i'll never get over the glory hole diet the the the

236
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,940
 actual guy that actually helped helped me and fixed my leg and the fact that when they got in

237
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,360
 into my hip socket they were like it was basically deteriorated into fragments and dust yeah we're

238
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,880
 really surprised how you were walking on that as am i assholes i told you this for you it's fucked

239
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,320
 if y'all listen to him bitch about it for the whole time you wouldn't be that surprised buddy

240
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,080
 yeah jacob

241
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,060
 and i were not surprised yeah it was terrible it was terrible if anything it was better than what

242
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:01,900
 we thought it was gonna be but this is the same thing like why the fuck don't i just you know and

243
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,900
 it's it's worse for women i know that too like it's one thing to be a heavy dude but but if you're

244
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,260
 a woman forget it my god the shit the fucking and that is the only aspect where it's harder

245
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,160
 to be a woman than a man but yes thank goodness only applies in the medical field oh yeah yay

246
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,540
 just aggravating as fuck well hope everybody has a good day i'll keep you posted um well jacob do you

247
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,420
 think there's any way that you could possibly rectify this because i know that there has

248
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:41,000
 recently been a kerfuffle on tiktok i don't know what other social media sites you frequent or are

249
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,360
 party to but there was a guy on tiktok i'm pretty much just i'm pretty much just tiktok paul i just

250
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,920
 i just do uh lots and lots of tiktok well he needed he needed a liver transplant right okay and the

251
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,480
 the insurance would not cover it they would not go through with it he was ready to do it and you

252
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,020
 know he he was gonna die and so he raised a bit of a stink on on his uh tiktok page and it went

253
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,720
 very viral and what do you know sure enough they turned around and they did the surgery and he's

254
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:24,060
 gonna live but it takes a couple of million strangers screaming at these mega corporations

255
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:32,740
 to say hey help this person it's fucked up i'm the same way i won't i won't do that i won't help

256
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,740
 anyone until there's millions of people experiencing intermittent outrage i would also like a liver

257
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:45,200
 though so uh if everyone could please raise a lot of outrage get jacob a liver i don't want i don't

258
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,940
 want any surgery i just want the liver um put it on ice by the way it's a little update on the old uh

259
00:24:52,940 --> 00:25:00,300
 duolingo um i've after what i was suggested to be friends with my dead friend i since i've got a lot

260
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,400
 of scoops and other people follow me on duolingo i'm following everybody back um i think it's gonna

261
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:13,960
 be really funny if my most popular social media outlet is duolingo um i am eating apples i am

262
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,940
 drinking water i am you know uh eating pan i'm asking people if they speak english or espanol

263
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:27,120
 i'm on a roll i'm on a roll yeah uh but but in terms of like hey do does your phone listen to

264
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,640
 you do apps listen to other topics and try to compete with each other my instagram apparently

265
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,720
 was very jealous of duolingo uh-huh so that they gave me not one but two friend suggestions for

266
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,940
 two people who were dead they two dead friends they offered me

267
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:52,180
 to follow back two dead friends just one and two right there first so many dead friends you can

268
00:25:52,180 --> 00:26:01,900
 follow what is happening why why would you compete with this yep i think actually matt you have

269
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:08,320
 inadvertently subscribed to cul-de-sac which is the new app that just has you trapped in a

270
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,920
 circle of dead friends and you can't escape uh yeah

271
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,260
 i'm downloading i have a lot of friends on seance have you guys downloaded seance

272
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,300
 that's good that's good

273
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:29,880
 you wanted you wanted to say spanish you got the seance you wanted to say spanish yeah that's right

274
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,480
 that's right uh chaotic points out in chat that my duolingo streak is better than my dead friends

275
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,860
 so there you go you got that going for me those are wins wins or wins might not have made the

276
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,760
 milers club but god damn it that streak is on no problem no problem what are we getting buried with

277
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,940
 our phones what's the plan here what are we doing with our what are we doing with our phones i don't

278
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,900
 know wait wait wait what what's the hypothesis that made that what's that how does that answer

279
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,420
 a question i don't know i'm just thinking like maybe you keep it plugged in throw some kind of

280
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,240
 bullshit ai on it and let it keep chirping and chipping away at people long after you're dead

281
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
 and be like hey man what's up you know it's like wait i thought you're fucking dead yeah i'm dead

282
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,620
 i got this ai running my running my shit it's just paul having weird dark thoughts over here i'm doing

283
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:24,420
 fine that's precisely like that i can't think of a more tech bro idea than being like wouldn't it be

284
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,680
 great when you as your ai self can let other people know you're dead so they don't have to

285
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,280
 find out from anyone else yeah i mean i mean your brain knows for like six minutes or something like

286
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,480
 that they say so hey yeah great yeah uh phones are waterproof now so it doesn't that doesn't

287
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,820
 mean i can't tell you that you're dead so it doesn't mean you're dead so it doesn't mean you're dead

288
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,080

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,280
 well i mean there's plenty of gravestones with qr codes and shit on them and that stuff's not

299
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,740
 gonna stay around forever it's just weird i don't know grave gravestone qr code is actually

300
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,160
 that sounds better to me than what we just came up with that seems like a lot of fun oh how so

301
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:08,360
 the idea of just strolling through a graveyard and scanning qr codes is both uh beautiful and

302
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,460
 you can do it right now there's plenty of graves with qr codes you can scan it up it'll bring up a

303
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,560
 little memorial and pictures and videos and stuff yeah that's what i want i want people on their

304
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,400
 phones you know like i really want people just to be in tech just in their day-to-day shit

305
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:35,940
 grieve through the screen grieve through the screen put these vr glasses on and grieve give

306
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,860
 me your grief in ai ai grief

307
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:48,260
 uh so my oldest kid's a spoiled brat he's this this this week ends with him going thank god you

308
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,180
 figured it out first this this week ends with him going to the sphere with his schoolmates to see

309
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,420
 wizard of oz which we still haven't seen uh-huh and then the next day uh they go to disneyland

310
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:09,380
 with the show choir that's that's his thursday friday this week tough tough days but uh uh

311
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:19,120
 the uh message we got for the sphere was hysterical okay so like one is that we have to

312
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,360
 fill out photo and press releases for our children in order for them to go you can't go unless you

313
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,800
 fill out a photo release because both the sphere and the school need to publish to publicize the

314
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:40,000
 event they're having school kids visit the sphere okay what's what's going to be shown is i've got a

315
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:46,680
 they show in the big nature film wizard of oz yeah no one cares about nature anymore paul

316
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,520
 that was when the sphere opened i don't think they even do the nature film anymore

317
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:59,700
 and then uh uh lauren shreve is uh it sounds expensive it is uh we we fundraise throughout

318
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,320
 the year you know it's it's death by a thousand donations with schools they just keep beating

319
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,680
 you with the same fundraisers i have no idea how much money we gave to make this happen but i know

320
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:17,540
 in like several several increments of time do you think that you gave more money to this than

321
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,840
 you would have given if you just paid for the kids to go to these events well certainly disneyland

322
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,240
 because their grandmother has a pass so all right yeah certainly yeah so more than free more than

323
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,340
 free uh you should have been like yeah yeah you can take my kid to disneyland hold on i'll set

324
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,900
 up his ticket then the sphere had a breakdown that was like hey

325
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:48,260
 there'll be no book bags or any kind of carrying permitted into the sphere not even water bottles

326
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,960
 you can't bring water bottles or anything into the sphere nothing your children will come in

327
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:01,420
 as they are dressed that's it okay and we will not sell any food or beverage to anyone while

328
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,420
 they're in the sphere this is the second point no this is no this is i get this because you get

329
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,140
 one peanut allergy and it's all downhill

330
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,020
 bottles of water no you don't want nothing it's the desert look give them some water go get your

331
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,000
 own camel back or whatever kids aren't camels fuck that this is the first line of the sand i've seen

332
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,580
 with anyone with school kids and their access to water because one thing kids have just been able

333
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,680
 to be fucking nuts with is that they must have access to these crazy oh my god they're so hydrated

334
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:37,980
 these children nowadays so hydrated mark gates is no peanut water peanut water

335
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:47,180
 there's a market salty and delicious peanut water my waffle house bug hey look at that is that

336
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,980
 official waffle house merch it's official waffle house bunk yeah did you buy that at a waffle house

337
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:58,860
 i bought it off the waffle house website because i was raving about waffle i just send me send me

338
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,640
 waffle house uh stuff and i was like what there's nothing here i will reusable coffee mug

339
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,420
 yeah look at that i like that it wasn't the yellows this is the blue one

340
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:16,700
 that is a classy subtle waffle house and uh but yeah so so the kids can go there they're they may

341
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,840
 starve while they are in there but that's what's gonna happen they go in there and they have no

342
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,820
 evidence that they were ever there ninjas they must come in and leave without a trace there's

343
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:33,320
 just gonna be a whole sphere filled with starved and desiccated children stuck like mummies to all

344
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,280
 the little chairs just i just want to know what the sphere is gonna do when a busload of kids

345
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,160
 shows up and they're all carrying water bottles like yeah what are you gonna do it really feels

346
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,600
 like like whoever's running the actual like boots on the ground part of the sphere doesn't have kids

347
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,140
 and like for like eight meetings they're like and there's a we have another request from school

348
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,220
 they're like jesus christ but these school kids want to come here god yeah and so i was like well

349
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:05,200
 it might be good pr all right they better sign photo releases they better have no evidence they

350
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,660
 were ever fucking here they better not fucking pee or eat or drink or not like i want to it's like

351
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,900
 it's just someone yeah tell them the bathrooms will be closed up tell them we pulled the

352
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:21,020
 bathrooms out there aren't bathrooms anymore we will bring them in through a series of locked

353
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:30,220
 chambers it's a bad idea i think it's a bad idea to bring them there yeah any of it yeah yeah

354
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,180
 i think that i think this fear is making a drastic error how about that

355
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,780
 uh do your kids are your kids familiar with the wizard of oz yes okay i wonder at what point

356
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,620
 well what point will we get to the point where people haven't seen the original wizard of oz

357
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,980
 enough to get what's going on at the sphere yeah i don't know i mean you know the whole thing is

358
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,720
 that the wicked wicked creates this extra more current curiosity for the original that's true

359
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,160
 yeah if anything

360
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,160
 couldn't couldn't have thought that this was that

361
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,480
 this was going to happen with that of all the you know quote-unquote ip the wizard of oz like you

362
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,800
 know that's a crazy it's a crazy ass weird psychedelic the guy who wrote wicked or the

363
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,140
 guy who wrote wizard of oz wizard of oz yeah the person who wrote the original yeah the wonderful

364
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:31,780
 world of oz and all that stuff yeah that um that's uh frank bomb right i think so bomb sounds right

365
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,180
 yeah so what's fascinating about him is that he's not a wizard of oz he's not a wizard of oz

366
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:48,040
 is that his wife is a woman of some renown who's now flying out of my head um one of the suffragettes

367
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:57,720
 or she can fly no no no i'll fucking find it but uh yeah his whole family situation was really

368
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:04,120
 really interesting and that's a big part of why he put women forward in much of his work

369
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,180
 because he's a woman of some renown and he's a woman of some renown and he's a woman of some renown

370
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,320
 he he and his family especially his wife are in the forefront of feminism in that time oh wow

371
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:19,700
 oh and it worked women have it so easy now yeah no good job everybody no but it's great i didn't

372
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,400
 realize that and it's good it's good that it's good that it just puts women forward and i don't

373
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:32,620
 necessarily make it like oh it's a pro-woman thing so it's good oh pro-women oh pro all right

374
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,000
 yeah so i still haven't gotten anything in the sphere so my kids will my kid will beat me to

375
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,840
 the sphere experience there do you have a a desire to do you have anything you want to go see at the

376
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:52,460
 sphere i don't have like an 800 desire yeah it's just the price point thing like even even the

377
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,020
 movies like yeah because because i'm not gonna see wizard of oz by myself so i think that's like

378
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:02,540
 200 something dollars right right but it's still a hundred dollar day if i take the fam right sure

379
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,140
 so that's like it's just it just it just doesn't add up or

380
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:10,580
 whatever yeah our pal lewis was looking out for me for a little while for first fear stuff that

381
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,460
 was popping up he runs that liquor distribution company oh right okay uh but still the spheres

382
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,520
 it's tight it's a tight ticket it's pricey it's a tight it's a tight ticket well uh if nine inch

383
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,860
 nails ever plays a sphere that will prop that that could very well get me to vegas they did

384
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,720
 uh metallica the metallica thing is like that's that but that's gonna be pretty great that's gonna

385
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,120
 be i bet

386
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,560
 i bet i'll see that one money so much money it'll be i think it's gonna be a lot of money and and uh

387
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,840
 but if i ever get the opportunity to i would go see the metallica the sphere that's for sure yeah

388
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,320
 are people making films of these concerts yes uh several of them yes okay i know there were

389
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,180
 films of the u2 one well i know see that's the thing like trent resner was working very closely

390
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:05,100
 with um james cameron at one point to put together a tour film and it just

391
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:11,820
 fell apart at the 11th hour but i would love still love to see all that um i still have

392
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,960
 i just realized i haven't i still haven't sat down and watched uh ozzy osbourne's last concert

393
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,140
 that that big huge concert they did shortly before he died that he actually performed at so two things

394
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,300
 from that you guys have both gotten really kind of contemplated or beating yourselves up for not

395
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:33,120
 seeing stuff it's really kelly has turned into a scarecrow and jack was just on uh tv talking about

396
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:42,480
 how the benefit money was way over inflated i guess they they had claimed like 190 million

397
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,180
 dollars or something like that for ozzy's concert yeah remember the giant big time money that was

398
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,040
 supposed to be coming in i don't remember hearing anything about the money but i believe it yeah

399
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,920
 this latest interview jack was like no it was like 10 million dollars yeah it's like it wasn't

400
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,660
 190 million dollars but then part of me goes oh wasn't it jack

401
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,060
 oh really mr runs the till

402
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:14,060
 yeah as far as i know we donated i don't think we got any money our way

403
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,080
 all the money went out no i've got a lot of expenses here if somebody could reimburse me

404
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:27,200
 that'd be that'd be really great exactly exactly so i don't know i don't know uh yeah so my kid

405
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,260
 my kid will do that and then i'll i'll go i'll actually take all of the school to metallica

406
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,080
 that's what i'll do

407
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,940
 good man that would be hip as shit well for your for your next kid's birthday you could have uh

408
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:46,640
 five of their friends uh show up they could learn to play all of the metallica music on uh real

409
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,160
 instruments and then you could book the sphere for them to open for metallica before metallica

410
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,560
 sphere concert you could do that and then the next day you could throw a birthday party for your kids

411
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,080
 and wanted me to tell you matt and wanted me to tell you i don't know if you know this matt but

412
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,100
 there is a thing about metallica that i don't know if you know this but there is a thing about metallica

413
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,620
 you could do for your kids and their friends relatively inexpensively if you wanted to show

414
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:18,480
 up like a boss uh starbucks has just unveiled a mr beast drink oh yeah that's smart of starbucks

415
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,580
 you could take the kids to starbucks for a mr mr beast pick me up i think that would be like number

416
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:30,280
 one uh on the kids list like if i if i if they could meet a celebrity i believe both my kids

417
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,080
 would choose mr beast really really yeah

418
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:40,840
 damn that's sad huh i know i started watching much less obtainable for them than audio guy for a podcast

419
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:52,480
 i uh yeah i mean they we just started watching beast games too the second season of beast games

420
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:59,260
 came out this is admittedly not as psychologically torturous as the first season so far i've only

421
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,080
 watched the first two episodes lessons have been learned there's been lawsuits have been settled

422
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,840
 not just a bunch of people being terrible right off the bat and just making everyone cry

423
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:13,140
 there's been a lot of tears in this first two seasons um and it actually is much more tears

424
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,580
 and actually much more of like competition stuff which is which you feel like legit things happen

425
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,640
 with winners and losers so i do think they've learned something from the first season which

426
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,580
 wasn't like go in a room until one of you has a psychological breakdown and then you lose

427
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,060
 it would have been difficult for them to i i

428
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,980
 how hard would it have been for them to just recreate that first season

429
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,700
 oh if they if you're just like do exactly the same thing here's the new people

430
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,040
 yeah you would have been like fuck no yeah i can't yeah it'd be if they did it again it'd be a felony

431
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:54,620
 no i thought it was so funny because he's he is remarkably uh not empathetic uh and he hosts like

432
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,740
 his authentic reactions of what he laughs at or like what gets him like uh a little a little

433
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,040
 stirring is always like wow he just has no room for him to do anything he wants to do

434
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,820
 uh another human heart in there just not right not in there um and uh there's one game where

435
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:16,180
 they had to wear circles on the colored circles on the back of their head and there was uh different

436
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:22,740
 circle colors on the floor and within 10 seconds you had to run and be in the proper color okay

437
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,920
 that matched the back of your head so it means you had to ask uh the person next to you what

438
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,960
 color is in the back of your head or whatever and so you quickly looked around to see who you had a

439
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,020
 line with and you had to ask the person next to you what color is in the back of your head

440
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:39,580
 and it would be truthful to you and in this particular round everyone was truthful with

441
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,920
 one another no one wanted to fuck anyone over oh nice and so everyone kept going to the proper

442
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,960
 colored circles and he kept being like if this is supposed to be a bluffing game and if no one

443
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,320
 plays the game then we have to find another way to eliminate people and you will not like it and

444
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,700
 he had to like admonish them for not fucking each other over and it's sure enough they did

445
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,000
 they just started drawing people at random and eliminating people uh because everyone's

446
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,620
 being truthful and even after the first rounds of that happening it never got the bluff game going

447
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:14,380
 they just eliminated people arbitrarily until it got down so that game was just people well you know

448
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,180
 that gives me a little hope that creeping fascism might have some speed bumps along the way oh no i

449
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,640
 think i think that is a i'm i'm not even terribly surprised to hear hear that honestly i've seen

450
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:31,360
 several things now uh like reality tv games i go down weird rabbit holes on these reality tv game

451
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,980
 shows especially uh foreign-made games and i'm not even surprised to hear that honestly i've seen

452
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,160
 some of the foreign-made ones yeah and uh i just got done with a korean one called something like

453
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,200
 the it translates to something like the devil's game yeah and it is not a well-made show uh but

454
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,600
 the game that they that they built to to build to to film the show around is a fascinating game

455
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,800
 and it was there were people who were doing kind of what you're talking about matt there was one

456
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,840
 guy specifically he was like i'm gonna try and play this game where nobody gets eliminated until

457
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,960
 the final episode we're just i want

458
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,000
 to play this game where no one gets eliminated and we just play for the prize at the end and

459
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,720
 that's it wow and it didn't work out that way but like he had real momentum going and just like

460
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:20,860
 kindness and working together is definitely something that is in in the face of shitty

461
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,560
 people doing shitty things is definitely something that is making a resurgence i mean i think people

462
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,860
 recognize that it's a needed commodity and and they're filling a void i think yes and i mean

463
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,940
 it's a good point that should be represented in those kinds of

464
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,500
 more uh exciting or mainstream or attractive kind of media ways people are generally good

465
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,740
 good like like the problem yes the problem is that what makes the news is very right now we're we're

466
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,840
 living in an unprecedented era of blatant power grabs by very powerful people right right and it

467
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,160
 used to be even the power grabbers would have to pretend to be altruistic or pretend to be you know

468
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,580
 uh caring in some way they had to do at least one press conference where it wasn't just about the oil

469
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:11,420
 could you imagine if you know as uh elon musk keeps winning court cases of anyone trying to be in the

470
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:16,100
 way of him becoming the most obscenely rich person on earth right and he keeps winning these court

471
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:22,360
 cases and tesla keeps battling to pay him the most amount of money possible and the thing that i find

472
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:31,900
 generally baffling if i were a major tesla shareholder i would just be furious yeah all the

473
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:39,140
 time and it's this it's this tech bro like messiah culture where they just make anyone who's come up

474
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:45,920
 with a good idea and got fucking really lucky um yeah become the most you know worship person on

475
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,480
 earth and therefore these things can't exist without the worship person being a part of it

476
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,480
 and uh it's really strange but could you imagine if he said hey if you if since everyone's since

477
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,840
 i'm making all this money i've decided to make dedicate blank of my income to go to these other

478
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,260
 people but he doesn't right i mean look there are plenty of examples of people who who have

479
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:11,800
 you know uh like right bloomberg soros there are plenty of people who have made sure uh that bill

480
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,980
 gates has spent a lot of his money and influenced with altruistic endeavors so it's not it's not

481
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:24,580
 without examples that uh that exist but it's just not the culture it's just simply not the way it's

482
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:31,420
 it's going and so right now we have an era where very few people are being blatantly greedy

483
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:40,560
 for both money and power and going out of their way to affect people's lives that have nothing to

484
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,540
 do with it right and this is yeah this is a weird thing and those people are inviting other people's

485
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:53,120
 kids to come to these weirdly elaborate birthday parties for their kids just to entertain it's not

486
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:01,840
 it's not free for the other parents i mean they have to do they have to spend the time and the

487
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:08,320
 with their children uh the parent did uh offered to reimburse anyone for expenses for for uh ready

488
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,140
 supplies and begged them not to spend more than twenty dollars so uh but but but it's interesting

489
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,940
 the thought did cross the mind obviously for that yes of course

490
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:26,520
 oh uh but yeah well but i i think the majority of people are still good and the majority of people

491
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,660
 are empathetic and look out for each other and i do too and we see it with people putting together

492
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:38,260
 like for example even the crazy ass liver story that you told paul millions of people did rally

493
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,980
 right yes like you know like yeah you know it's like we we we do look out for for people all the

494
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:51,360
 time i did you see the uh the field doctor pepper thing uh i have a lot of friends in minneapolis so

495
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,320
 i'm haphazardly now uh donating to numerous couples who are trying to get their loved one

496
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,800
 out of uh detention from uh ice agency although they are citizens so yeah uh

497
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:08,800
 well matt i'm glad that this has i'm glad that all these people's discomfort has provided a way

498
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,840
 for you to feel a little bit better about yourself i'm a good person so yeah yeah no you're doing

499
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:20,360
 great matt yeah i mean you can't have my liver but other than that you're good we're fine what

500
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,100
 about part of it all right let's talk all right all right all right it grows back what's the

501
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,120
 doctor better friend do that i had a friend do a live uh donation live liver donation oh wow

502
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,780
 because your liver is one of your only organs that

503
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:37,740
 does grow back yeah it regenerates yeah yeah i mean yours yours is a strong term for you jacob

504
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:44,920
 but like the general one's liver can grow back yeah yeah a liver can grow back a liver can go

505
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:52,360
