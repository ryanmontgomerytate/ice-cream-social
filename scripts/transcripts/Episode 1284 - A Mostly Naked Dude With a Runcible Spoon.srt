44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
 I don't think all of it.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,500
 Yeah, all of it!

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,800
 All episodes!

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,500
 It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social sitting over there in Indiana.

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,100
 It's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh.

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,200
 It's Paul sitting in Vegas.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
 It's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
 We're preaching fun.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,900
 We're preaching fun.

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,700
 Are we twitched up?

54
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
 We're twitched up.

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,900
 Matt is still freezing.

56
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,100
 He took us off over there in Indiana.

57
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,600
 Me, too.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,500
 Yeah, we're recording this on a Monday.

59
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,800
 My feet are a little chilly.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,500
 It's just shy of 70 here, and I am slightly uncomfortable.

61
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
 I have my house shoes on.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,600
 They're taking care of most of it, though.

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,500
 So don't worry about me.

64
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,100
 Did you get a snow measurement, Matt?

65
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,400
 They said 20 to 24 inches fell here in Indiana.

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,000
 Oh, my goodness.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,100
 That's double what we got.

68
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,900
 That's crazy.

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,600
 Yeah, and because of that, they don't serve breakfast anywhere.

70
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,000
 I went on a very long, long, cold walk with Mike Mills on our Tech Guy scooter.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,300
 We were inept, but it changed our opinion of where we were staying.

72
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
 So we were finishing up our show.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,000
 We did a show in Leicester, Kentucky.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Then we did two shows in Cincinnati.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
 And we were supposed to go out to Bloomington and do a show.

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
 It was canceled.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,900
 And then we're heading to Chicago.

78
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,600
 But it's another show being produced out here by Mike Mills.

79
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,000
 And so we were going to come out here to see a preview of that show anyway.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,200
 I don't know if it's public yet, so I can't say which show it is.

81
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
 It's a tradition that people may or may not have heard of.

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,700
 But so we're deciding whether to snow ourselves into Cincinnati

83
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,800
 and then just see if the roads are good to come out Monday to watch the show.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,700
 Yep.

85
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,700
 And then go to Chicago after that or snow ourselves in in Indiana.

86
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,600
 Where you're at and be right there.

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,100
 And then just be here for three days.

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,900
 And that will be fun.

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,800
 And so we voted for going to Indiana.

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
 So we finished our show and it was already snowing when we were packing up our van.

91
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,300
 Yeah, it was really exciting.

92
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,700
 And then we did you have that like that that that feel of like we got to get the fuck out of here or we're not going to.

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,500
 Yes.

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
 Yeah.

95
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 And and so off we went.

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,200
 I don't like that feel at all.

97
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,800
 Off we went hit the snowy roads driving at a brisk forty miles an hour.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
 Good as we head out through the snow.

99
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,800
 And we're in a big sprinter van.

100
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
 It's nice and heavy.

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,300
 So we're not worried about feeling good.

102
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,300
 We weren't something to slide last like hour of the trip.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,500
 It was supposed to take like an hour forty five minutes took three hours three and a half hours.

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,700
 Yeah.

105
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,200
 And we were following a snowplow, which is one good because we're driving on a plowed street.

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,000
 The plows go about fifteen to twenty miles an hour.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,800
 Yeah, they're not they're not known for their quickness.

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
 No, no.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,800
 So we were just like it was a crawl to the to the place.

110
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,000
 Now we're staying at the spot called the Grant Street in here in Bloomington.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,800
 And we call the head twice to be like we might come out late tonight.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,600
 Is that OK?

113
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,500
 And then we're definitely coming out late tonight.

114
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,600
 Is that OK?

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,400
 And so we pull up and the Grand Street is actually like three houses converted into a hotel.

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,500
 So, OK, you check in the main house, but then you get sent across the street to the other house.

117
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,200
 So we pull up at about three o'clock in the morning.

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,100
 Mike goes in and we hear nothing for like ten minutes.

119
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,900
 We've just taken three and a half hours here.

120
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,800
 We're finally at the place we want to be.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 And now we're just sitting in the car.

122
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,300
 And then Mike says you guys might want to come in or whatever.

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,600
 So we couldn't find we couldn't find anyone at the hotel.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,000
 And then finally someone woke up and came our way and said,

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,200
 oh, gosh, I don't even have the passwords for the computer.

126
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,700
 I don't think I can check you guys in your house.

127
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,400
 Right. And this is things like Mike Mills.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
 I've had him on an abracadabra.

129
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 I should have him on here.

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
 It's very funny guy.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,500
 Also called calm like jacket again.

132
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,600
 Oh, shoot. You're clipping all this calm guy.

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,700
 Yeah, like at all.

134
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,000
 This is what time though.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,600
 This is what time in the lobby of the hotel 3 3 15 in the morning.

136
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,800
 Yeah. And you've been you've been driving behind the snowplow

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
 for how long about an hour.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,600
 And I asked him to chat earlier who drives who was driving.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,000
 Initially, I was driving as I picked up the car in Cincinnati

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,100
 and I drove it to Lexington and I was trying to drive.

141
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,900
 And Mike Mills does so much for the tour.

142
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,900
 I produce it and also does all of the logistics and stuff.

143
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,300
 So I thought I would drive but because it was snowing

144
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,200
 and he lives in New York and I live in Nevada.

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,800
 He thought he was maybe a little more qualified to drive in the snow than me.

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
 He's at least had a more recent practice most likely.

147
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
 Did you tell him Jersey born?

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,300
 Yeah, no, he's aware.

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,100
 He's aware.

150
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,900
 Y'all didn't have an argument about it though.

151
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,200
 Yeah, much like Springsteen people know where I'm from.

152
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,100
 They figure it out.

153
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,500
 Yeah. So we go.

154
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,400
 So your dreams is where he's from.

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
 Well, we got to stay here.

156
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 I guess like in the main building like at least you got to have at least in the lobby.

157
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,700
 No, but like a key to open up some room somewhere like they have to be something right.

158
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,200
 Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

159
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,300
 So she says yes.

160
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,200
 And so we start opening the van.

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 It's still snowing, right?

162
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 This is this is the right.

163
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,800
 This is the start of the God.

164
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
 Yeah. So we're unloading all of our stuff.

165
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,600
 And then one of the really funny things that happens that both Mike

166
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,700
 and I have tricks that involve can't liquids cans of stuff.

167
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,200
 Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,300
 Okay.

169
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,000
 We can't leave that in the van.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,400
 So we bought we bought enough for the whole tour.

171
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,900
 So we had to like haul every all of our liquid props flats of cans of water in.

172
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,000
 Yes.

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So to unload everything and we get halfway through unloading our van.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
 Oh, no, I figured it out.

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,900
 We can get you guys checked in across the street.

176
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,800
 No problem.

177
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 Oh, god damn it.

178
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,100
 So then we pick up all our stuff and load it back into the van.

179
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,600
 I again, Mike, Mike, when he came out to explain this, he was like,

180
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
 I can't fucking believe this, right?

181
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,200
 Like he occurs.

182
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,900
 He never curses.

183
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,600
 He's like, I can't fucking believe he's he's shoveling snow off of the thing

184
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,500
 because he hasn't told us yet to unload our van, but he's clearing the way

185
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,600
 as he's cursing to like he's clearing a path.

186
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,900
 So I tried to like do an end around and I grabbed the shovel

187
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,200
 and I run across the street to like pre I start shoveling the other house

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,300
 out so that we can load our stuff into the place that we are staying.

189
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,200
 Gotcha. OK, you're thinking ahead.

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,800
 Yeah, the van can't get out of the parking space that it's in because of the snow.

191
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,400
 It's like we're doing the wibbly wobbly, you know, rock it back and forth thing,

192
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,100
 trying to get some grip, you know, and we finally get loose.

193
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
 It goes up at three thirty in the morning.

194
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,200
 We finally get loose.

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,400
 And it's we're on a one way street and it's snow covered, right?

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,300
 So it's definitely one way street, one lane, one way street.

197
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
 And we get to the middle and we're about to unload our stuff.

198
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
 And just another car just pulls up behind us.

199
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,100
 Oh, shit.

200
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,100
 And it's four in the morning.

201
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
 Yeah.

202
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,700
 Mike drives around the block, right?

203
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,600
 It takes like five minutes a good night.

204
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
 And I'm like just shoveling away.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I have no gloves.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,100
 It's 15 degrees and I'm just shoveling away, waiting for the van to return.

207
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,900
 Luckily, you're only 19 years old.

208
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,100
 Furiously shoveling away.

209
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
 It's still snowing like a mother.

210
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,400
 And then he pulls back around.

211
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,600
 Yeah. We open the door and another car pulls up in the morning.

212
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,300
 Also, this area is a grid, right?

213
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,200
 Like it's not complicated.

214
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
 You can go around us, right?

215
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,400
 Yeah. And then so Mike pulls up and he actually pulls up just so we can

216
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,200
 get the car out of the way that reverses back.

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
 Yeah.

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 And we unload half of our van through the path I've shoveled into the house

219
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,300
 that we're staying at and halfway through a car.

220
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,700
 I can see it coming from blocks away.

221
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
 Our hazards are on.

222
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,000
 It is a giant Sprinter van.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,200
 The doors are open.

224
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
 We are moving in a chain of four people unloading.

225
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,300
 There's clearly something happening.

226
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:16,000
 This thing happening and a car just eases right up behind us and stop.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,500
 And I just said, we're finishing the unloading and I yelled at the team

228
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,400
 and I shot the dirtiest look to the person in the car.

229
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,200
 Like, are you fucking kidding me?

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
 You saw us.

231
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,900
 You can literally right now reverse 50 feet.

232
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,700
 Yeah, and drive left and just go a different way.

233
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,500
 Yeah, so they waited better than where I was afraid.

234
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,400
 The story was going.

235
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,100
 I was afraid.

236
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
 The story was going like I saw the headlights.

237
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,400
 He was coming ran right into the van.

238
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
 Oh my God.

239
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
 Yeah, no, no, no.

240
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,300
 But so yeah, so we loaded in.

241
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,900
 Thirsty Scoop says good thing.

242
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,500
 No, they want to change in your pocket.

243
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
 Right, right, right.

244
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,700
 So anyways, didn't have the password.

245
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,800
 It's the wrong place like we were pretty kind of a we were making fun of this hotel for a minute.

246
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
 You know, right.

247
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,000
 Come with it.

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
 So look at us.

249
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,500
 We're still doing it.

250
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 Got the two mornings later.

251
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,900
 We said we're going to try to get breakfast.

252
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,100
 Now, you know, famously, there's a restaurant here called The Runcible Spoon, which I have loved visiting here.

253
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,300
 I've talked about the Runcible Spoon.

254
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,200
 Runcible Spoon is what it's called.

255
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,300
 What's that mean?

256
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,100
 Who knows?

257
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,900
 What's the word Runcible?

258
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,800
 The Runcible is the word.

259
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
 What's that mean?

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,800
 We looked it up before, but it was unmemorable because we've had this conversation before.

261
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,100
 But I because I came here when I came.

262
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,000
 I played when I played Washington, Indiana, Aces Bar Grill.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I know that we've had this conversation before because there was it was Google remembered it.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,300
 Yeah, because I call it.

265
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,400
 What did it mean, Jacob?

266
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:04,100
 It's a nonsense word invented by Edward Lear, most famously from Owl and the Pussycat.

267
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,200
 Okay, great.

268
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
 Yes, he will never remember that again.

269
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 No, we'll forget next time.

270
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,900
 It's a nonsense word.

271
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,400
 Oh, it's like Jaleco cats.

272
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,900
 Yeah.

273
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,200
 All right.

274
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,100
 Great.

275
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
 But even dumber.

276
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,700
 And when I came here, I said I said it was like it was like it was like all the waitresses were like different Manson girls.

277
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,800
 Like that's what it was like college kids.

278
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,800
 Whatever.

280
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
 And it's hold the wall.

281
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,000
 I remember that part.

282
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,800
 Yeah, exactly.

283
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,600
 Well, that's what we all remember.

284
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,400
 That's why we all want to go back.

285
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,100
 Right?

286
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,900
 So principal spoons still not open for the blizzard didn't recover at 24 hours.

287
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,200
 No dice.

288
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,900
 We walk out and about to all of all of Bloomington and all these restaurants are still closed this morning.

289
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:56,300
 Yeah, we came back into the the host house of our three house hotel to get coffee and very kind host who wasn't the guy

290
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,900
 who's up at three through the morning is like you guys doing all right, you know, like, oh, well, we just tried to take a walk.

291
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,600
 And we didn't make breakfast here this morning because we thought we were going to walk somewhere else for breakfast.

292
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
 But every place is closed or whatever.

293
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,000
 He goes, oh, well, let me see if I can get some at least get some like fruit and stuff together for you guys.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,300
 Some vittles rustled up.

295
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,000
 Oh, and he goes downstairs and he comes up because, you know, the cook hasn't left and we still have eggs and bacon.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,700
 You guys wants to make up some eggs and bacon.

297
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,600
 Yes.

298
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,400
 Yeah, they went out of their way and gave three of us like an amazing immaculate breakfast.

299
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,800
 How kind Wow.

300
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,700
 And I was like, we are and I just turned to Mike.

301
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,600
 I was like, we are eating our fucking words right now.

302
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:46,100
 We've been trashing this place for 24 hours and they totally outclassed us today and they were just everyone.

303
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,700
 There was an incredibly nice.

304
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:55,300
 I went above and beyond and so I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Grand Street in right.

305
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,100
 Except that maybe they should have that past check in process is a little little if you take the put a post that know the password

306
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,700
 somewhere that everyone knows, you know, so you're like the password password.

307
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
 Who cares?

308
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,700
 And maybe we were just pissed about driving, you know, 42 to 15 miles an hour for three and a half hours.

309
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,700
 But you had also called ahead and giving them the heads up.

310
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,300
 That's it.

311
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,800
 That's a lot of you gave them the heads up a couple of times.

312
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,300
 We gave them that's something that is something.

313
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,600
 I'll tell you who else is something.

314
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
 These folks really are something.

315
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
 And that's the following sponsor.

316
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,000
 Today's show is brought to you by go.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,800
 Go phone go Michael Jackson's my skulls.

318
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,700
 Jack's son had exercises for dancers.

319
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,800
 Michael Jackson my skulls.

320
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,600
 Jack son head exercises for dancers.

321
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:09,300
 Hey, everybody, I just want everyone to know that I have opened a whole new store.

322
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,600
 It's called Michael Jackson's my Jackson's skull exercises for dancers.

323
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,800
 And many of you don't ascribe to phrenology, but that's ignorant.

324
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 That's just ignorant.

325
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
 Phrenology is key when it comes to dancing.

326
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,000
 The way your head's aerodynamics work with the breeze.

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
 That's if you can be a better dancer that way.

328
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,200
 Hey, are you saying that you that you're a good dancer because of your head shape?

329
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
 That's exactly right.

330
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,100
 Michael Jackson's head shape is perfect for being a good dancer.

331
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,800
 If you know anything about phrenology, then you'd understand, but you don't know.

332
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,900
 Phrenology is the study of the shape of the head and the discovery of attributes and traits.

333
00:16:51,900 --> 00:17:01,600
 It's been disproven time and again by science, but embraced by horrible racists for generations.

334
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
 So why are we talking about it?

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,200
 Because that's the only way I can open my school.

336
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
 You're ignorant.

337
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 You're ignorant.

338
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,400
 I had to open my school based on phrenology because I'm not a medical doctor.

339
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,000
 The only doctor I know gives me mama's milk.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Give me milk.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Give me some milk.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I need to sleep.

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Give me more milk.

344
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,300
 Check out.

345
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:41,000
 Well, speaking of he, it happened.

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,300
 Ladies and gentlemen, it happened.

347
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:53,400
 There is a new masters of the universe movie coming to theaters this year, June 5th.

348
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
 Yes.

349
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,280
 Are you excited about this?

350
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
 Paul?

351
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
 I'm very excited about this.

352
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
 Okay.

353
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
 Are you excited about how excited Paul is about this?

354
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,680
 Are you excited for the inevitable crash?

355
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
 I watch.

356
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
 Oh yeah.

357
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
 He's going to hate the movie.

358
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 He's going to hate it so much.

359
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
 I don't know.

360
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 I don't think I am.

361
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,840
 So they've been trying to make different masters of the universe projects for a while and this

362
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
 one finally came to fruition.

363
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,960
 Do you know the story behind that?

364
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,400
 Well, I mean, the other ones have been put on the back burner for several different reasons,

365
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,440
 probably because they were shit and Mattel didn't want their brand damaged, but here's

366
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,400
 why I'm hopeful.

367
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,420
 The Barbie movie, the Barbie movie made a fuck ton of money and was also critically

368
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,040
 lauded.

369
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:49,520
 So that combo put into Mattel's mind, Hey, if we put some auteurs and some actual directors

370
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,600
 in charge of this stuff and maybe hire some actors that actually know how to perform,

371
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,280
 we can put a little gravitas on the stuff.

372
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,520
 Well, they got a lot of other really great people in this movie too.

373
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
 A lot of really great people in this movie.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,960
 So I think they've learned their lesson with Barbie that this can be another real bankroll

375
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,140
 move and possible, you know, legacy protector if they do it right.

376
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,920
 And so I don't think they're fucking around.

377
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
 I know.

378
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,540
 So Paul, what are your thoughts on the trailer?

379
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,540
 It looks great.

380
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,080
 You just think you're just generally excited about it.

381
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,360
 There wasn't, there wasn't a single part of it that really stood out to you.

382
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 Everything.

383
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,640
 I mean, it all looks so like, okay.

384
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
 So here's the thing.

385
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,720
 I already talked to the scoops about this in the chat before, but I'll talk about it.

386
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,700
 So you've got Marlena Glenn, who was an astro, a human astronaut from earth.

387
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,380
 That is Queen Marlena, Adam's mother, right?

388
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,800
 And the trailer focuses on her talking to him as a child, sending him away to earth

389
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:05,240
 for protection because likely because Adora had been captured and war was continuing.

390
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
 That's all.

391
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
 That's all a real story.

392
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
 Yes.

393
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
 That's all.

394
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 That's all a lore.

395
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
 What's the word?

396
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
 Cannon.

397
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
 This is cannon.

398
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
 Yeah, this is legit.

399
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,040
 This is why I'm excited is because the real ones know that this is no, this is real.

400
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,800
 So I assumed watching this trailer that this was made up something like this, this whole

401
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 premise of like sitting earth and then, and then protecting all this stuff.

402
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,140
 Now that never happened.

403
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,240
 That never happened.

404
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,720
 However, Adora did get stolen away by Hordak and it would make sense for Marlena to want

405
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,480
 to protect Adam as the last heir to the attorney and throw really hard to take you seriously

406
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,000
 with their names like Hordak involved, just telling you how it went down.

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
 Hordak stole baby Adora.

408
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,240
 It's pronounced sex worker deck now, pimp deck for those who know.

409
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,380
 He keeps that pimp deck hand strong.

410
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,440
 I mean, Hordak's not even in the movie is he's even, he's even higher up than Skeletor.

411
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
 He's the one that trained Skeletor.

412
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,380
 So you know, this is going to be, they're leading, it's going to, it's going to end

413
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,760
 up leading to like sequels, which is going to be really cool, but no, this is legit.

414
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,920
 Marlena is from earth.

415
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,840
 He man is half earthling, half Eternian.

416
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,920
 That's part of the lore.

417
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,360
 That's part of why he is magically imbued.

418
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,440
 That's part of why he is this, uh, you know, character that transcends world or just fuckable

419
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
 Mormon.

420
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,640
 I mean, now the blonde hair and all that, that's an unfortunate side effect from, Hey,

421
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,320
 we have to make this unique IP.

422
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,520
 Conan doesn't have blonde hair.

423
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
 Let's do that.

424
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,000
 Because the origins of the masters of the universe toy line are steeped in a lot of

425
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,240
 weird shit, but not least of which Mattel was in talks with the Conan movie guys to

426
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,080
 possibly do a movie line, right?

427
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
 Yeah.

428
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,560
 But some of that, then they had to really deflect hard.

429
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,520
 So they made it sort of sci-fi, a little more spacey, a little more weird, a little more

430
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
 fantasy even than Conan.

431
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,800
 And they changed the look of he man drastically to keep him away from the Conan comparisons.

432
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 Oh yeah.

433
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 Yeah.

434
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,280
 No, he man and Conan could never change it super drastically.

435
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,760
 One of them is a mostly naked dude with a big fucking sword.

436
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,000
 And the other one's your mom.

437
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 That's absolutely, it's absolutely from Conan.

438
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,080
 Let's let, let's don't get it twisted.

439
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 I know that.

440
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,280
 I know where that stuff like, yeah.

441
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,080
 But Fisto shows up in the trailer, which is fantastic.

442
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
 Fisto's in there.

443
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
 Spy cores in there.

444
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
 In there.

445
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,080
 There's no Hordak in the trailer, but Fisto's just a coincidence in the IP.

446
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,560
 I'm sure Fisto's in it, but it's great.

447
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,640
 I mean, they start off with showing Adam in on earth and he's working for HR and they pan

448
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,720
 over his desk and it says Adam Glenn, which is, you know, his mom's last name.

449
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,820
 And it's got the he, him pronouns on there, which is a hilarious joke.

450
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,600
 Of course he's he, him, he's, you know, he man, uh, just fucking hilarious.

451
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,760
 Oh, so hilarious.

452
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,040
 I laughed so hard when I saw it, but not only was it funny, it's also a litmus test.

453
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,280
 Matt, how much would Paul hate that joke in any other movie?

454
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 No, no.

455
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,680
 What do you think, no, it's a litmus test for people who can't stand pronoun shit.

456
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,480
 And if you, if you focus on that as like a negative thing and don't get at the joke of

457
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,080
 it all, I don't, I don't have no hope for you.

458
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,560
 He's called he man, what the fuck?

459
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,200
 He is all pronoun.

460
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,400
 So then, you know, he goes into this toy shop, somehow he finds out that the, the power,

461
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
 the power sword.

462
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,600
 Why would I watch the trailer if you're just gonna walk me through it?

463
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,360
 This is what we're doing is we're reacting to it.

464
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,040
 Have you not watched any reaction videos?

465
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,060
 Do you not know how this, how reaction and breakdown videos work?

466
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,440
 I didn't know we were turning our podcasts into a reaction video to the trailer that

467
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,080
 it wasn't what I would like to do.

468
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
 That's what's happening.

469
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 All right.

470
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
 Well, what do you want to talk about?

471
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
 About it?

472
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
 Hold on.

473
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,840
 My next question to you was going to be, why did you make Jacob and I watch this?

474
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 What was your plan?

475
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,760
 You just revealed your plan so we could talk about it.

476
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 Yeah.

477
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,320
 I had already figured out that that was his plan, Matt.

478
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,520
 And so I was about to pivot by saying, Matt, did you have any thoughts on the trailer?

479
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,640
 I here's okay.

480
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,720
 Let me just address why I don't think it's going to do the same thing.

481
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
 Barbie did.

482
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
 Okay.

483
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,920
 Barbie was a comedy.

484
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
 Yes.

485
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,040
 It was like a really like fun comedy, like Casper, like really sophisticated comedic

486
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:52,600
 performers and it had a nice kind of feminist anthem and it was coming out against Oppenheimer,

487
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 which was incredibly masculine.

488
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,840
 So it was a really good way for like women to rally on opening weekend because there's

489
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,800
 a good, any contention that just basically wasn't interested in watching a move, a three

490
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,280
 hour movie about a guy who invented the atomic bomb was going to maybe go out and have fun.

491
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,000
 This, I did the Barbie Heimer day.

492
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,360
 It was a great day.

493
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,440
 This movie is made for neither crowd.

494
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,500
 I mean, he's made for kids.

495
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,560
 It's made for, it's made for Paul.

496
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
 That's what I think.

497
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,960
 I think it's really made for Paul because Paul, you said, can you make your kids watch

498
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
 it?

499
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,600
 I'm trying to think if watching this trailer, whether, whether my kids would be into it

500
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
 or not, I'll find out.

501
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 I'll find out.

502
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
 That's what I want to know.

503
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 That's what I want to know.

504
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,000
 I want to know if the, if a generation removed from all the hype has any interest at all.

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,680
 Does it, does it look interesting to people who don't already know what it is?

506
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
 Yeah.

507
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,880
 I'm seeing, I'm seeing yes from a lot of people who don't know in the chat.

508
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:55,920
 Tell us if I, in the chat, I'm curious if you were not familiar with the he man IP already,

509
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,520
 did this trailer make you, make you want to watch it or continue to not care about it?

510
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,560
 And actually like, I was just trying to make jokes, I mean, I'm not, I wasn't like, Oh,

511
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,920
 what the fuck about this movie.

512
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,840
 I just was like, Oh, this is kind of, I basically felt like I thought the trailer was kind of

513
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
 weird.

514
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
 And I was like, who is this for?

515
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
 That's what I thought when I watched it.

516
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
 Yeah.

517
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
 Well, I mean, here's the thing.

518
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,480
 Uh, we don't know, uh, how it's going to be, uh, and I'm ready to hate it.

519
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
 I'm ready to hate it.

520
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,040
 I hated the first one.

521
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
 I did not like that.

522
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,760
 Paul is always ready to hate movies about things that he loves.

523
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,880
 That's what I mean.

524
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,280
 Like I'm not, I'm not Paul is sincerely prepared to hate this film.

525
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,680
 This is a rare instance though, where I'm optimistic going in even after seeing the

526
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
 trailer.

527
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
 I'm just shocked that you're optimistic.

528
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
 Me too.

529
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,920
 When you believe me, I am as shocked as anyone.

530
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,880
 I was ready to just be like, Oh fuck, they did it again.

531
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,680
 But no, this looks very hopeful to me.

532
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,480
 When you text us last night to watch the trailer, I thought it was that we were going to rip

533
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
 it apart.

534
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
 No.

535
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,400
 I mean, you can rip it apart if you want to do that.

536
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,840
 You can rip it apart if you want to.

537
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,720
 I've already, I've already erased my notes.

538
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,920
 Once I heard your change of the tone, I raised my notes.

539
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,000
 No, do you have a fucking notes?

540
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,440
 If my notes, full of shit, uh, if there's anything that stood out to you as weird, I

541
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,600
 mean, I don't know if I've ever taken notes.

542
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,480
 It's hard for them to, it's hard for them to fight the whole Marvel influence.

543
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,320
 So that's clearly there.

544
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 That's clearly there.

545
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,680
 And they, and they've definitely toned down the colors of everything.

546
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,320
 So it's not quite like it's not that eighties bright.

547
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,280
 I'm concerned, but it's also not as dark and dreary as the first movie.

548
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,340
 It's brighter than that first fucking movie about the giant cartoon tiger.

549
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,360
 You have concerns about Cringer and battle cat.

550
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,500
 I have concerns about the giant cartoon tiger and being able to take scenes with the giant

551
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 cartoon tiger.

552
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 Seriously.

553
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,160
 I mean, see, this is another thing that two options to go with Cringer or battle cat and

554
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,120
 you insist on saying cartoon tiger.

555
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
 I do.

556
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,140
 Because that's what it looks like in the trailer is a giant cartoon tiger.

557
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,000
 He's a giant cartoon tiger.

558
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
 Uh, I don't know.

559
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,680
 I, I, there's something, I mean, I, I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff.

560
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,520
 I'm a sucker for anthropomorphized kind of animals.

561
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,620
 I did love He-Man as a kid and I did love it because I loved Coda, Coda the Barbarian.

562
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,620
 I definitely did.

563
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,240
 I definitely did connect the two and like it accordingly.

564
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,740
 Uh, and I watched the cartoon and stuff when I was younger, I say I liked it.

565
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,960
 I liked the toys.

566
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,720
 I never really watched the cartoon.

567
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,960
 You guys are younger than me.

568
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
 I watched Shira.

569
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
 Yeah.

570
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
 No shit old man.

571
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
 I know, but you really are.

572
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,680
 I mean, I was that thing, that fucking show got me right in the zone.

573
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,840
 It hit me exactly right.

574
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:57,560
 And I know I'm a victim of the Reaganomics, uh, fair broadcast standards, half hour commercials.

575
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,160
 Fuck every Gen X kid, train them to buy shit thing.

576
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
 I know.

577
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
 I know.

578
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
 I don't know.

579
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,500
 I just, I really, I was impressed with what they're doing with the source material.

580
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,880
 I'm pleased to see good performers in key roles.

581
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,800
 Idris Elba as man at arms.

582
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:22,040
 That is Idris Elba in the movie does definitely that, that is a check in the plus column for

583
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
 sure.

584
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
 That's a big check.

585
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
 Alison Brie is Evil Lin.

586
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
 Sure.

587
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 Alison Brie is awesome.

588
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,680
 Um, and I'm genuinely a bigger Jared Leto fan than you are in general.

589
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
 Well, that's great.

590
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,880
 And Monarella Buchanan is the sorceress, uh, Inara from Firefly.

591
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 Right.

592
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,640
 Like, yeah, like that's a great choice for the sorceress.

593
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,080
 They've made some really good choice and I don't know who the actress portraying Tila

594
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,360
 is, but she looks wonderful too.

595
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,800
 And you know, you talk about the whole feminist thing, Matt, I think it's not Tila Tequila.

596
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 It's not Tila Tequila.

597
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
 Not get the role.

598
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:05,880
 I think you have to remember, uh, Matt, that I scoop shooter on the same page, that, uh,

599
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,080
 women did a really good job of putting female characters forward in a time when that was

600
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,600
 not common.

601
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,040
 Like Tila was right there with Adam and, and, and he, man, like she held her own.

602
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,140
 She held her own.

603
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,880
 Same thing with the sorceress being the key to the whole secrets of Grayskull and the

604
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,680
 leader of the, of the whole, you know, good guy forum.

605
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,960
 And then of course, She-Ra being the evolution of that.

606
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,440
 And then it being a very female fronted show.

607
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,880
 In fact, they hate women.

608
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,240
 No, I'll tell you who else hates women.

609
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:52,160
 And that is the following sponsor by, oh, we shouldn't do this one, but I'll read it.

610
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,320
 Bill Cosby's guide to consent with a new special forward by Sean pity P. Diddy combs.

611
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,920
 That's an excellent joke.

612
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
 We're moving on.

613
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,160
 I'm reading that for high coup scoop, but we're moving on.

614
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,520
 Yeah, this is much, much cleaner.

615
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:14,120
 Gloria's glory hole hand drill from the sound man scoop in 2021 that is Gloria's glory hole

616
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
 hand drill.

617
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
 Keep it clean.

618
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
 Gloria.

619
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,680
 I heard you got a hand drill, hand drill.

620
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,640
 I heard you use the hand drill and the wiener sticking through the holes.

621
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,120
 You don't have to use it.

622
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,320
 If you don't want to, it's fine.

623
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,080
 Just leave it all behind.

624
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:47,320
 Hand drill Gloria, Gloria, watch out for the wieners.

625
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:55,680
 Gloria, here come extra wieners sticking through the glory hole.

626
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,160
 Grip them with the hand drill.

627
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,040
 Don't touch them with your hands.

628
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,160
 Your clients will understand.

629
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,280
 Gloria's hand drill glory hole and her hate scoops to check out.

630
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
 There you go.

631
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,880
 No, what I will tell you, Matt, back in the day, the Mattel executives were very upset

632
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,800
 because he man was cutting into Barbie sales because they had, they had some female forward

633
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 characters.

634
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,720
 And especially when princess of power debuted, uh, you know, that's kind of why they split

635
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 the lines.

636
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
 I hear you and I, I don't mean to cut you off in that.

637
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
 Like I knew it.

638
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
 I didn't know that.

639
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
 I didn't process that.

640
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,240
 I was talking about like current marketing power and sure, they have some great females,

641
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
 some great prominent roles.

642
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,840
 The titles, literally he man, it's literally and the masters of the universe and the masters

643
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
 of the universe.

644
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,880
 Is it called, is it called he man and a master's universe?

645
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,720
 I think this one might just be another master's universe.

646
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
 I can't remember.

647
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 Okay.

648
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
 I don't know.

649
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
 I don't know.

650
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
 I'm finding that.

651
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,160
 I don't know who's got top billing.

652
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,760
 I can't tell you what I'm trying to say is like that can all be true from a writing standpoint.

653
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,360
 It's not from a marketing standpoint, right?

654
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,160
 Like it's, it's not, oh no, for sure.

655
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
 I was a kid.

656
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,920
 I didn't know it was called masters of the universe is called masters of the universe.

657
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
 Great.

658
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
 The universe and it's femininity.

659
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,400
 Like there's nothing, nothing about the trailer that I saw was like, Oh girl, girls are going

660
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
 to love and rally around this empowering.

661
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,760
 Well, and the poster has, you know, they do love man facing off against scale tour, two

662
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,560
 dudes looking at each other to fight.

663
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,960
 So yeah, I get that.

664
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,640
 But it's not, it's not the same brand as, as Barbie, it's not, but this is, but this,

665
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,720
 this is like, you know, when the Barbie, I'm more like coming from this with like the Barbie

666
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,080
 versus Oppenheimer thing was such a phenomenon at everyone in Hollywood was racing to figure

667
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,880
 out what the takeaways were going to be.

668
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,680
 And none of it seemed to be that women led things can be funny.

669
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,760
 And instead it was like, we can do more movies with other toys.

670
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,140
 And I don't know if that was the right takeaway from an executive lesson, but learn the wrong

671
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
 lesson or not.

672
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,160
 They've got good people on the project.

673
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:11,480
 Look, it is now maybe, you know, it is existing IP that's been out there and those are things

674
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,060
 that people want to make movies out of.

675
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,360
 And so yes, for people like yourself and other people who grew up with Heman and yeah, maybe

676
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,200
 my kids will, their friends will want to go see it and they'll revitalize the franchise

677
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,600
 with the kids.

678
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
 You have to do that.

679
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 You have to try that.

680
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,600
 Yeah, and scooper Nova girl in the chat is like, what, you don't think women won't love

681
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,160
 a mostly sexy, naked man with abs fighting?

682
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
 Of course.

683
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
 Good point.

684
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,400
 It's not, you know, you can put the, he meant some serious man candy.

685
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,740
 He may point, uh, you know, so there's something he said there, episode title.

686
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,840
 He man candy.

687
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,960
 That reminds me of a story I heard, uh, over the weekend of, uh, uh, your good friend,

688
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
 Murray Sawchuck, Jacob.

689
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
 Yeah.

690
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
 I love Murray.

691
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,340
 The guy played, uh, I love how this bit has just morphed into just me and Murray just

692
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
 being genuinely good.

693
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,520
 He gave me that amazing parking spot at his wedding.

694
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 That's right.

695
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,480
 Um, uh, uh, someone said, uh, they were playing a college gig and they were like, you were

696
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,280
 so different than the last guy we had.

697
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,720
 And I was like, it wasn't, they go, uh, they go Murray Sawchuck.

698
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,400
 And he said sarcastically, did he show you his abs?

699
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
 Yeah.

700
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,360
 And they giggled and said, we touched his abs.

701
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:41,760
 Oh no, he does like an app parade, a big part of his show, the app parade.

702
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
 You can have his autograph.

703
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,640
 He can rub his abs and make a wish.

704
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
 Just do it.

705
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,080
 Just do a pencil, a pencil rubbing, a charcoal rubbing of his abs.

706
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
 And etching.

707
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,400
 And I just, you just push it against his abs and rub and get up and get the, like, like

708
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,520
 going to the, going to the, the wall at the Vietnam Memorial.

709
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
 Vietnam Memorial.

710
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
 Yep.

711
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
 Yeah.

712
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
 Yeah.

713
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
 I get, I get how it goes.

714
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
 Uh, that's crazy.

715
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
 Well, uh, yeah.

716
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,520
 Uh, you know, I don't know, I'm just really excited for, uh, I watched a couple of reaction

717
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,280
 videos from many of the creators that I follow who are into action figures, of course, primarily

718
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
 Pixel Dan.

719
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,800
 I wanted to get Pixel Dan's take because I've been following him for decades now.

720
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
 You like Pixel Dan?

721
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
 Talking He-Man.

722
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,880
 Pixel Dan is, he wrote the book on He-Man.

723
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,040
 He literally has the full compendium of all the action figures and all that kind of thing.

724
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,960
 He did a review for every figure that came out in the classics line as I was collecting

725
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
 that line.

726
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,700
 So he's how I kept up with it.

727
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,620
 And he's got two young boys now himself.

728
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,160
 And they of course know him as a toy enthusiast.

729
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,300
 His livelihood is going to toy shows, talking about toys, creating toy videos.

730
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,260
 So he drags them along to toy shops all the time.

731
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,280
 They themselves are not really into He-Man, those two, his two young boys, right?

732
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,000
 Because that's dad's thing, you know, and that's been his thing since he was a kid.

733
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,040
 However, when he showed them this trailer, then they asked to get the castles out and

734
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,480
 they're playing He-Man again after seeing this trailer.

735
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,320
 So there's something there too.

736
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
 Interesting.

737
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
 Like you're right.

738
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,840
 Then like as an adult looking at it, seeing it as like derivative of Marvel, but in terms

739
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,240
 of like what kids are growing up on, they're growing up on Marvel movies.

740
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,400
 So if it feels like it scratches that itch, it's probably gonna make kids more interested

741
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
 in seeing it.

742
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
 Absolutely.

743
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
 That's true.

744
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,680
 And, you know, He-Man is a superhero.

745
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
 That's what it's about.

746
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
 It's about empowerment.

747
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,320
 That's what the whole superhero thing is about.

748
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
 It's about empowerment.

749
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:39,880
 And that's, you know, I mean, Marvel is no less guilty of going to the lowest levels

750
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,520
 of marketing research to do, you know, I don't know if you're familiar with Secret Wars.

751
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,680
 You familiar with Secret Wars?

752
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
 Yeah.

753
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,120
 But that all came from just marketing.

754
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,460
 Marketing meetings about what do kids like?

755
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
 They love the word.

756
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,340
 They love secrets and they love Star Wars/wars.

757
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,240
 And so they go, "Oh, let's just do Secret Wars."

758
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,920
 We actually changed the department of our government to the Department of War.

759
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

760
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
 We love that word.

761
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
 That's what we love.

762
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
 That's what the kids love.

763
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
 Kids do love that war.

764
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,520
 And now it's a secret war that's going on in broad daylight that we can't really talk

765
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
 about.

766
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
 It's wonderful.

767
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
 So fun.

768
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
 So fun.

769
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
 All these secret wars.

770
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,320
 Where's the fucking Beyonder to fix this shit?

771
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,680
 No, he started it.

772
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
 He started it all.

773
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
 We need Adam Warlock.

774
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,400
 That's what we need.

775
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,360
 No, but that's the whole thing of where do you find that-

776
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,680
 Wait, if they say that you have a right to carry a thing, but they shoot you because

777
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,880
 you carry the thing, do you have the right to carry the thing?

778
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
 I don't know.

779
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
 That depends on where your political allegiances lie.

780
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
 I don't know.

781
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 It's so confusing.

782
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
 Yeah, yeah.

783
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
 It's weird.

784
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
 I don't know how it all works.

785
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,480
 It's a real head scratcher there, Jacob.

786
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
 Yeah, yeah.

787
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
 God damn it.

788
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
 It sucks to be in 30s Germany.

789
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
 I'm going to watch the trailer again.

790
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
 I'll probably figure it out.

791
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,020
 This is part of it too.

792
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,040
 This is coming out like a week later, so we should say who knows what other atrocities

793
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
 have happened.

794
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
 Oh, God.

795
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 That's true.

796
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
 Yeah, fuck yeah.

797
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
 That's true.

798
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,760
 We are recording this as a couple of days earlier than we usually record it.

799
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
 That is one-

800
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,840
 In the two extra days, who knows?

801
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
 Right.

802
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,720
 One other thing about the Masters of the Universe property and the movie, it filled me with

803
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,120
 some hope, which is something we're in desperate need of right now.

804
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,520
 It's certainly what cinema should be focusing on, for sure.

805
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,200
 He-Man is a bright spot.

806
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,600
 The Masters of the Universe has been a big bright spot in my life.

807
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,180
 I love the mythology behind it, and that's the thing.

808
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,000
 Like I said, they are adhering to the true lore and mythology.

809
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,880
 They're playing with it, but that's fine.

810
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,720
 That's what it has to ... You have to do that.

811
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,640
 You have to toy with it a bit, but I love the interpretation so far of the vehicles

812
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,160
 that I'm seeing and all that kind of thing.

813
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,080
 They look like rotons going through the sky, but you couldn't have a roton looking like

814
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,960
 a fucking roton if it looks stupid, but it looks cool.

815
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
 It looks really cool.

816
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
 What's a roton?

817
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
 What's a roton?

818
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
 A roton is the vehicle that you would push along and it had a-

819
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
 What's a spaceship looking thing?

820
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,480
 It looked like a ... Well, it looked like a spaceship with a giant saw blade.

821
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,520
 What is it in the trailer?

822
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,280
 It's the spaceships that have two, a little orb being encircled by two spinny big-

823
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
 Got you.

824
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,800
 Because the toy, that was the toy with the ... It was on wheels, right?

825
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,400
 It had a wheel at the base and as you pushed it, the saw blade would rotate and it looked

826
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,000
 like ... It looks like a saw blade around a car.

827
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Yeah.

828
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Right.

829
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,600
 Which, as an adult, I recognize isn't terribly practical.

830
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
 Mark Gates in the chat.

831
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,760
 Yes, you're exactly right.

832
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,600
 Roton is the stuff you put in queso dip.

833
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 Yeah.

834
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:34,000
 Get yourself a can of roton and melt some ... You are ready for some salsa.

835
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Yeah.

836
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,320
 Paul, did you see the Superman trailer before the Superman movie came out and what did you

837
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,400
 think of it then?

838
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,240
 I did not watch the Superman trailer.

839
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,880
 I purposefully did not watch the Superman trailer to keep myself-

840
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,240
 Yeah, I was surprised that you were an advocate of watching the trailer because you are traditionally

841
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,400
 not a trailer guy.

842
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,800
 I know, I know, but this is so dear to my heart and I didn't want to get spoiled.

843
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,840
 You couldn't help yourself.

844
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,520
 I didn't want to get inadvertently spoiled.

845
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,280
 I was like, "I'm just going to go and take it in," and I was pleasantly surprised.

846
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,200
 I'm really enthused about the direction I see so far.

847
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,760
 There's every possibility it's a shit show.

848
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,280
 We haven't heard any dialogue.

849
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,560
 We haven't heard anything.

850
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,160
 Who the fuck knows how the story is going to play out, but it looks good having Marlena

851
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,080
 give that gravitas of like, "We hid you away so you wouldn't be killed by these ... There's

852
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
 real threat there."

853
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
 That's kind of cool.

854
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,860
 If you had to send your child to another planet in order to not have him kidnapped by an evil

855
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,660
 space dictator, that's kind of neat.

856
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,320
 That tells me that they're respecting the fact that Adora was kidnapped in the past

857
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,200
 and that traumatized the fuck out of Marlena, so she sent her child to another planet.

858
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
 That's big.

859
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,880
 I don't know.

860
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,680
 Not since the last Starfighter.

861
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:51,360
 Paul, who are you going to dress as when you go to see it in the theater?

862
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
 That's a good question.

863
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
 I've been thinking about it already.

864
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,680
 What I'm going to do ... I'm just going to put on my favorite He-Man shirt.

865
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
 That's all.

866
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
 I'll just put on my favorite Master's Universe shirt.

867
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,320
 You're just going to show up as the OG.

868
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,360
 You're just going to show up and be like, "I've been here since the beginning, and I'm

869
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
 still here."

870
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
 Yeah.

871
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,480
 I mean, I'm a big guy.

872
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,760
 I've always contemplated doing Ram-Man cosplay.

873
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,440
 You should go as Orko.

874
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
 Thirsty Scoop in the chat is right.

875
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,320
 You should dress as Orko.

876
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,280
 I used to have an Orko outfit.

877
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
 It didn't look good, though.

878
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,800
 It was just one of those hoodies that also had a mask and a silly hat.

879
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
 It was okay.

880
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
 It just didn't look right.

881
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,880
 I ended up losing that in the move, but ... Yeah, and Orko hasn't shown up yet, so that's another

882
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,260
 thing that could happen.

883
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,560
 But that could be another thing.

884
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,880
 They might just be pausing that for now.

885
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,720
 That's another whole thing.

886
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,920
 I'm going to dress as an incredibly angry goose, and people are going to go like, "Oh,

887
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
 Fisto.

888
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
 I get it."

889
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,520
 It is a shame how fast I got that.

890
00:42:51,520 --> 00:43:00,760
 It is terrible, it says bad things about me as a human being, how fast I got that.

891
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,160
 Fisto the goose.

892
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,000
 Oh, my.

893
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,080
 Yeah, so I don't know.

894
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,240
 And then even ScooperDoverGirl was asking early in the chat about popcorn buckets, and I'm

895
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
 like, "Oh, shit.

896
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
 Who knows?

897
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
 Who knows what kind of popcorn we have?"

898
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,080
 Oh, the amount of collectible shit you're going to be ...

899
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,200
 Oh, well, that's the whole thing.

900
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,640
 We've already solicited like 10 new figures, and who knows how long that line will go.

901
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
 Oh, yeah.

902
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
 Paul is going to be broke.

903
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,880
 I'm already collecting three damn He-Man lines as it is.

904
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,380
 Preachingfun.com, everyone.

905
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
 Preachingfun.com.

906
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
 Please.

907
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,380
 Paul is going to be on the street.

908
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
 Help me afford my plastic.

909
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
 Paul is going to be destitute.

910
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,380
 Please.

911
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,880
 He is going to be on the street, people.

912
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
 Please, I need my plastic boys.

913
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
 Preachingfun.com.

914
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
 I need my plastic mans.

915
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,640
 Will keep Anne McFeeters home.

916
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,840
 What does it come out?

917
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
 June 5th.

918
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
 Oh.

919
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
 I believe.

920
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,720
 I'm so angry that it's not until June, and we have to hear about this until June.

921
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,800
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

922
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,360
 This was going to be ... This is the big discussion I wanted to have.

923
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,360
 Again, I just want to lay it out there that I'm very hopeful.

924
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,200
 I'm very pleased with what I saw so far.

925
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,280
 I am ready to shit on it if it turns out to be garbage.

926
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,740
 You know I will.

927
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,800
 You know I hate ... Oh, yeah.

928
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,320
 I hated that latest Tron movie.

929
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,680
 I love the soundtrack.

930
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,040
 I'm not partial to my IP.

931
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,840
 I'm not blind to the holes in my IP.

932
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,760
 But that's also ... You love to hate things that you love.

933
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:34,100
 The beautiful thing about Masters of the Universe is that it really is a tool for imagination

934
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,040
 and exploration.

935
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,960
 Back when I played with my figures, most of my lore came from what I'd read in the little

936
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,620
 mini comics.

937
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,000
 I would ignore a lot of the filmation stuff.

938
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,560
 I loved Hordak.

939
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,200
 I do not care for the filmation depiction of Hordak at all.

940
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,720
 That's hashtag not my Hordak with the ... and snorting like a pig half the time.

941
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,080
 No, thank you.

942
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,880
 That's not evil to me.

943
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,920
 That's just a weird ... That was a weird choice.

944
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,280
 I said good day, Hordak.

945
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,760
 I do say good day, Hordak, because he's a cool looking villain.

946
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,980
 So we'll see, we'll see, but I can't wait.

947
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:23,200
 I teared up, the movie got to me, the preview got to me.

948
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,520
 It doesn't take much.

949
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
 I'm on thin ice already.

950
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,400
 The whole country's falling apart, and then I see He-Man come hanging around.

951
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
 I'm like, "Oh."

952
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
 Yeah, there you go.

953
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,160
 Yeah, that's ... I had a really weird thing happen to me the other day.

954
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
 What's that?

955
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:45,440
 I was walking down the Strip and a party bus, like a big limo party bus, which is not uncommon,

956
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,860
 comes rolling down the Strip right next to me.

957
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:55,880
 I'm on Vegas Boulevard there, I'm on the sidewalk walking down the road, and this bus has rolled

958
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,880
 down windows.

959
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,720
 So all the windows are rolled down, and the whole thing is just filled with what looks

960
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:08,680
 like, I don't know, 13-year-old girls, 12, 13-year-old girls, young tween girls, and

961
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,720
 they are all leaned out the bus windows.

962
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,040
 Heading to the Trumpet Hill?

963
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,040
 I am the only person on the sidewalk.

964
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,320
 I'm the only person around.

965
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,200
 They are all leaned out the window, and when they see me, they all do the hand thing and

966
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,920
 yell the 6-7 thing.

967
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:37,960
 And they keep on driving, and I believe that has triggered a full mid-life crisis.

968
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,280
 They broke your brain.

969
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,640
 I think they broke me.

970
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,640
 I'm done.

971
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,640
 Oh, God damn.

972
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,920
 I am out.

973
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,920
 This has ... I stood there for a minute, just going, "I don't even know ..."

974
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,560
 Just dumbfounded, huh?

975
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,720
 Should I step into traffic?

976
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
 Should I ...

977
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,720
 It's a wrap, huh?

978
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,720
 Like, what should I do now?

979
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,960
 And I'm walking, I'm like, "I am more than halfway through my life.

980
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
 I really am."

981
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,400
 Like, I have lived more years already than I'm probably going to live.

982
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
 Yeah, that's probably true.

983
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
 Yeah.

984
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,880
 What the fuck was that?

985
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
 That was so weird.

986
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,680
 That's a hell of a way to measure it with that, with that kind of event happening, to

987
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
 really clock that.

988
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
 But yeah.

989
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,000
 Those children with their Terminator vision, which they wouldn't understand by reference,

990
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,920
 would scan to you and say, "Old man engaged.

991
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
 Six-seven him.

992
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
 Six-seven him.

993
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
 Six-seven old man."

994
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,720
 Also, I was like, I wanted to go and stop them and be like, "Hey, the six-seven thing

995
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
 is out, guys.

996
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,720
 That's done.

997
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,280
 I don't know where you guys have been, but that is simply out.

998
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
 I know that.

999
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
 It's weird that you don't."

1000
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,640
 Yeah.

1001
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,560
 I'm so sorry, Jacob.

1002
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
 Thank you.

1003
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
 Thank you.

1004
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,680
 It was and continues to be dramatic.

1005
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,440
 See, if it's any consolation, I think you've lived at least two-thirds of your life, you

1006
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,440
 know?

1007
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,440
 I'd be not sorry.

1008
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,220
 But see, this is another thing, Jacob.

1009
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,880
 If you were like me and you were obsessed with a childhood toy property for the majority

1010
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:26,760
 of your existence and, you know, even when there was lean times, even when nobody was

1011
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,080
 talking about Mass of the Universe, you were in it, in it to win it.

1012
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
 And now it's back.

1013
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
 Nobody had to take that away from you.

1014
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,080
 You know what I mean?

1015
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,080
 But this is the thing.

1016
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,080
 Nobody wants to.

1017
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
 I was back.

1018
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,080
 I feel like-

1019
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
 Jacob, think if they were making an Archie Manning video.

1020
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,080
 Archie Manning movie.

1021
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:50,240
 Now, bring it back.

1022
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,800
 Oh, now I get it.

1023
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,320
 Now I- thank you, Matt, for clarifying that.

1024
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,360
 Now I understand the stakes involved.

1025
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
 That's what it does.

1026
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
 That is what it does, though.

1027
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
 It does kind of give you a reset.

1028
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:11,360
 That's the level of like a Bobby A. Bear documentary, a deep cut for you fucking Saints fans out

1029
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
 there.

1030
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
 That's right.

1031
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,360
 Let's do a little Jack vs. Nerd.

1032
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:25,360
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1033
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:44,080
 Of tweets on a bus yelling at me.

1034
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,000
 To pass the time we took in a comedy special, Eric Dillman recommended his friend Renan

1035
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,360
 Hirschberg on YouTube.

1036
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,360
 Okay.

1037
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,380
 His newest special is called Morbidly Jewish.

1038
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,640
 And I won't try to do anything butcher too much from it, but the one that really made

1039
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,120
 me lots of maybe left really hard at it.

1040
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,840
 But what was he goes?

1041
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:10,520
 You know, Harry Potter got in trouble for like, you know, having, you know, the people

1042
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,320
 run in the bank where these like goblin people and they were like, Oh, that's anti-Semitic.

1043
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
 Yeah.

1044
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,320
 The green gods.

1045
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
 And that's anti-Semitic.

1046
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,120
 And he goes, isn't watching made up creatures and thinking they're Jewish stereotypes more

1047
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:36,000
 anti-Semitic than the green gods being anti-Semitic.

1048
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 I put nothing.

1049
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 I put nothing.

1050
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 Path JK Rowling though.

1051
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 She's got intentions.

1052
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 Right.

1053
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,800
 She's actually, you know, she meant all definitely if you have a chance to got Morbidly Jewish

1054
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
 on YouTube.

1055
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,800
 That sounds funny.

1056
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,800
 Nice.

1057
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
 What's his name again?

1058
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
 Renan Hirschberg.

1059
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
 R-A-A-N-A-N.

1060
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,320
 And you say he's Jewish?

1061
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,320
 Yes.

1062
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
 Okay.

1063
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,440
 Let's do a little scooperty here.

1064
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,560
 We got a scooperty from Smitty Scoop here.

1065
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,200
 Like you know how, you know how I'm from New Jersey, Paul?

1066
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
 Right.

1067
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
 Uh huh.

1068
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
 That's how you'll know that he's Jewish.

1069
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
 Got it.

1070
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,200
 Yeah.

1071
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
 Because Matt Donnelly told you.

1072
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,200
 Got it.

1073
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
 Gentlemen.

1074
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,720
 Well, Matt won the first Smitty scooperty of 2026, but it may be a bit premature to

1075
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,480
 declare that Matt has officially dethroned Paul and Jacob and reclaimed the Smitty scooperty

1076
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
 crown.

1077
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,160
 So I prepared another scooperty for your enjoyment to give Paul and Jacob a chance to redeem

1078
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
 themselves.

1079
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,400
 Here we go.

1080
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,760
 The categories are Winter Olympics, Geography, Sitcom Spouses, and Hard.

1081
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,460
 Oh shit.

1082
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,460
 All right.

1083
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,400
 I'll start with hard for 400.

1084
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,800
 Here we go.

1085
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,080
 Rachel, what's for dinner?

1086
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,160
 I'm married to Rachel Maddow now.

1087
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,220
 My giant brother still wants to fuck my wife.

1088
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,840
 My mom and dad are mean.

1089
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,840
 Oh boy.

1090
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:01,580
 What sitcom was Paul talking about?

1091
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,160
 That has to be Everybody Loves Raymond.

1092
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,160
 Yes.

1093
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
 Yeah.

1094
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
 Okay.

1095
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:17,520
 That was so confusing, Paul.

1096
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
 That's a crazy quote.

1097
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,720
 I'll try Sitcom Spouses for 1200.

1098
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
 Okay.

1099
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:27,680
 What is the name of the character played by Patricia Heaton for nine seasons on Everybody

1100
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,680
 Loves Raymond?

1101
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,880
 Oh my God.

1102
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,320
 What is the name of the character played by Patricia Heaton for nine seasons on Everybody

1103
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,160
 Loves Raymond?

1104
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,600
 I'm really glad because when I was answering the last question, I did have to pause for

1105
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,680
 a moment and go like, wait, was it Everybody Loves Raymond or Everyone Loves Raymond?

1106
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,440
 Everybody Loves Raymond, but the name of the wife.

1107
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
 I got to pass.

1108
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
 I don't know.

1109
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,560
 I love that Smitty Scooperty is the one thing that drives me to finally watch an episode

1110
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,460
 of Everyone Loves Raymond, but does it pass to me?

1111
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,460
 It does pass to you.

1112
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,460
 It passes to you.

1113
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,460
 It's a pass for me, Jacob.

1114
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
 Yeah.

1115
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,460
 It's a pass for me as well.

1116
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,460
 Deborah Barone.

1117
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,460
 Deborah Barone.

1118
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,920
 No way you would have a last name.

1119
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
 No way.

1120
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
 No.

1121
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,280
 Did she not take his last name?

1122
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,280
 Who cares?

1123
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,280
 Theography for 400.

1124
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,640
 Does Colorado share a border with Idaho?

1125
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,840
 Yes.

1126
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
 Let's try yes.

1127
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,240
 No, both Wyoming and Utah share a border with Colorado and Idaho, but Colorado and Idaho

1128
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
 do not border each other.

1129
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,240
 Dammit.

1130
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,240
 Oh, I'm seeing in the chat.

1131
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
 50/50 shot.

1132
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,240
 I'm seeing in the chat.

1133
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,960
 Barone was Raymond's last name in the show.

1134
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
 He was Raymond Barone.

1135
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
 Oh.

1136
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
 Well, there you go.

1137
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
 There you go.

1138
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
 It's me.

1139
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
 I'll try.

1140
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
 He was his name.

1141
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
 Barone.

1142
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
 R-O-N-E.

1143
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,880
 I'll do Winter Olympics for 400.

1144
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,880
 Daily Double.

1145
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,880
 Here we go.

1146
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,300
 What country is hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics?

1147
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,480
 None country.

1148
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,480
 Not going to happen.

1149
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,480
 Canceled games.

1150
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,240
 I mean, that's probably true.

1151
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,240
 Is it us?

1152
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,240
 I don't know.

1153
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
 Yeah.

1154
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
 US?

1155
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
 It is.

1156
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
 I'll say US.

1157
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
 Italy.

1158
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,240
 No, I didn't know.

1159
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,240
 I didn't know.

1160
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,960
 No, I didn't think you were doing that.

1161
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,040
 There's snow issues.

1162
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,600
 They're having issues that they might not have enough snow for events.

1163
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
 Oh.

1164
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
 Oh, yeah.

1165
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
 They should come out to Pittsburgh.

1166
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
 Whoa.

1167
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
 Whoa.

1168
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,600
 Whoa.

1169
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
 Oh.

1170
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
 Go on, Florida.

1171
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
 Hold it.

1172
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
 Winter Olympics in Indiana.

1173
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
 Horf.

1174
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
 Horf.

1175
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,600
 Horf.

1176
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,600
 Paul.

1177
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
 I'll go with hard.

1178
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:56,080
 For 800, what is the minimum number of darts that have to be thrown to win a single leg

1179
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,480
 of double in, double out, 501 darts?

1180
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,480
 Nine.

1181
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,480
 Nine.

1182
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
 Nine.

1183
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,480
 Nine.

1184
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,480
 Nine.

1185
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,480
 Nine.

1186
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,480
 Nine.

1187
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
 Nine.

1188
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
 Nine.

1189
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
 Nine.

1190
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
 Nine.

1191
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
 Nine.

1192
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
 Nine.

1193
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
 Nine.

1194
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,480
 Nine.

1195
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,480
 Nine.

1196
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
 Nine.

1197
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
 Nine.

1198
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,480
 Nine.

1199
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
 Nine.

1200
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
 Nine.

1201
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
 Nine.

1202
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,480
 Nine.

1203
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,480
 Nine.

1204
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,480
 Nine.

1205
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
 Nine.

1206
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,480
 Nine.

1207
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
 It is considered to be on par with a 300 game in bowling.

1208
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,480
 Hooray for me.

1209
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,480
 Did you know that or did you guess?

1210
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,480
 I did.

1211
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
 I did.

1212
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
 Rock hard for 1200, please.

1213
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,480
 Yeah.

1214
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,320
 Including the pincer claws.

1215
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,960
 How many legs does a crab have?

1216
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,360
 Oh, Matt, this is so up your alley.

1217
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,360
 Yeah.

1218
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,480
 Eight, 10, 12, or 14.

1219
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,960
 Including the pincer claws now, Matt.

1220
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
 I know.

1221
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,840
 Usually you don't include the pincer claws when you count crab legs.

1222
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,760
 This time make sure that you do.

1223
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,200
 I see the legs as legs and the claws as arms.

1224
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,200
 That's the way I've been brought up.

1225
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
 Right.

1226
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
 That's the way I was taught in my town.

1227
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
 Yes.

1228
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
 Yeah.

1229
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,680
 Wonderful to see everyone's favorite, Clawful, in the Master's Universe movie.

1230
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,680
 Oh gosh.

1231
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,280
 Clawful, of course, having a big claw pincer arm.

1232
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,280
 I hope so.

1233
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,200
 Not at all like Fisto, who has a big fist arm.

1234
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,200
 Exactly like that.

1235
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
 There was three of those guys.

1236
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,960
 There was Clawful, there was Fisto, and there was Jitsu.

1237
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,280
 They all had fucked up hands.

1238
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,360
 Oh, I don't remember Jitsu.

1239
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
 A, eight.

1240
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
 Eight?

1241
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
 I'm sorry.

1242
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
 It's B, 10.

1243
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,360
 Oh, you forgot about the pincer claws, Matt.

1244
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,360
 I didn't count the pincer claws.

1245
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
 I told you to remember the pincer claws.

1246
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,360
 I was raised to see them as arms.

1247
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,360
 You will not go back on that.

1248
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,360
 Lindsey in the chat says she just wants some claws in her mouth.

1249
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
 I'll close out hard for $2,000.

1250
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,360
 She's got crab legs in my mouth.

1251
00:56:41,360 --> 00:57:04,520
 Is it possible, while driving on an interstate highway, to travel directly from Nevada to

1252
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:10,520
 Utah without passing through another state?

1253
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,560
 I don't think it is.

1254
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,440
 I'm going to say no.

1255
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,440
 Ah.

1256
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,600
 Yes, but not on I-15, which passes through a small sliver of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah

1257
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,840
 share a 240 mile long border, and I-80 crosses this border.

1258
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,360
 I always forget about I-80.

1259
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,360
 You always do.

1260
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,660
 Matt doesn't count the pincer arms on the crabs, and I don't count I-80.

1261
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,000
 I sort of realized that I-80 went that low.

1262
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,920
 I-80 goes pretty low.

1263
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:51,320
 It goes from the Golden Gate Bridge to the George Washington Bridge, so I thought it

1264
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,320
 would not go that low.

1265
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
 Which are both in San Francisco.

1266
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
 Paul, you're up.

1267
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,920
 I-40 across the country.

1268
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,760
 I will try Sitcom Spouses for $2,000 to get some money on the board.

1269
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,760
 All right.

1270
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,760
 What is the name of the character played by Patricia Richardson for eight seasons on Home

1271
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,600
 Improvement?

1272
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,980
 My God.

1273
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,000
 How dehumanized was that character?

1274
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,800
 Tim and ... Was it Heather?

1275
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,920
 Did he call her Heather?

1276
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,040
 Did he call her ... Heather Tooltime.

1277
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
 Heather Tooltime.

1278
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,040
 Heather Tooltime.

1279
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,040
 Samantha Tooltime.

1280
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,040
 Taylor.

1281
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,040
 Her last name was Taylor, so she'd been ... Angela?

1282
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
 Fucking pass.

1283
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,040
 Angela.

1284
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,040
 Angela.

1285
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
 Angela.

1286
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
 Matt.

1287
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,040
 Katrina.

1288
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,040
 Yeah.

1289
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,040
 Katrina.

1290
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,040
 It's a pass for me, please.

1291
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,040
 Mrs. Taylor.

1292
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,040
 People say it's Mrs. Taylor.

1293
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,040
 Mrs. Taylor.

1294
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,040
 You nasty.

1295
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:54,320
 This is ... Oh, people throwing straight hints in the chat.

1296
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
 Straight fire hints.

1297
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
 Oh, all right.

1298
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
 Yeah.

1299
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,320
 Well, it doesn't matter.

1300
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
 I can't see them.

1301
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,760
 I ... Boy.

1302
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,600
 I watched this show ... I watched Home Improvement for at least a few seasons with my dad.

1303
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,600
 Yeah.

1304
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
 Oh.

1305
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,600
 I watched it all the time.

1306
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
 Yeah.

1307
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,640
 I'll give you a hint if you want one, Jacob.

1308
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,640
 Okay.

1309
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,640
 Jill is in my head.

1310
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,640
 All right.

1311
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,640
 Jill is in my head.

1312
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,640
 So I'm going to go Jill Taylor.

1313
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,640
 Did I know?

1314
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,280
 It's Tim the Toolman Taylor, and I think it was Jill.

1315
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
 There you go.

1316
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,040
 It is Jill Taylor.

1317
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,040
 Jill Taylor.

1318
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,040
 Jill the drill, they called her.

1319
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,280
 They called her Jack and Jill.

1320
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,040
 There's no ampersand in that name.

1321
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,280
 Matt, you're up.

1322
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,280
 Oh, fuck.

1323
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,760
 I don't want to answer any of these, Jacob.

1324
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,360
 Fair enough.

1325
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,400
 Fucking Winter Olympics for 800.

1326
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,360
 Oh, let's see.

1327
00:59:51,360 --> 01:00:03,200
 In what sport did Peermann Zabrigan, Alberto Tamba, and Phil Meyer, and Justelle Andre

1328
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:11,800
 Amont, short, and Petra Kronberger, Herman Myhr, whatever.

1329
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,160
 All these people won gold medals.

1330
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,160
 What did they win gold medals for?

1331
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,480
 Is this the Jamaican bobsled team?

1332
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,920
 Jacob, the answer to every question in the Winter Olympics category should be who cares.

1333
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
 Right.

1334
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
 Is it skeleton?

1335
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,920
 It's skeleton.

1336
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,920
 It's always skeleton.

1337
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,440
 I'll pass.

1338
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:39,120
 How much is it for?

1339
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,120
 I don't remember.

1340
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,120
 I think it's the little one.

1341
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,120
 I'll guess skeleton.

1342
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,120
 Alpine skiing.

1343
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,120
 Oh no.

1344
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,120
 The skeleton of the Winter Olympics.

1345
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,120
 Oh no.

1346
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,120
 It took all my points away.

1347
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,120
 Skeleton, you betrayed me.

1348
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,120
 It's skeleton.

1349
01:00:49,120 --> 01:01:04,420
 Not the first time I've been betrayed by a skeleton.

1350
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:08,560
 At Lake Placid in 1980, Eric Haydn won five gold medals.

1351
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,800
 In what sport did he compete?

1352
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,520
 Haydn seek.

1353
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,520
 He's a master.

1354
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,520
 Nominative determinism.

1355
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:27,300
 As is the case in most of the Winter Olympics sports.

1356
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:33,800
 That's why Jake Skellington won the skeleton.

1357
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,080
 Phil Luge?

1358
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,080
 You can't Luge.

1359
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,080
 Sure.

1360
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
 Sure.

1361
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,440
 That's the only place Luge can win.

1362
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,600
 Oh, there's a joke there somewhere.

1363
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,600
 I don't know where it is.

1364
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,600
 I'll pass.

1365
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
 Paul, what is it?

1366
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,520
 You won the Luge, you can't Luge for winning?

1367
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,040
 Eric, where are you hiding those gold medals?

1368
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,720
 Pass.

1369
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,680
 Pass.

1370
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:03,040
 Let's see.

1371
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,040
 Speed skating.

1372
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,040
 God damn it.

1373
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,680
 I was praying for the skeleton.

1374
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:14,480
 I competed unprecedented sweep, wedding, gold at all five distances, 500, 1000, 1500, 5000,

1375
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,120
 and 10,000 meter speed skating.

1376
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:23,920
 Speaking of praying for the skeleton, have you guys seen the fucking horror show that

1377
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,760
 happened out here in the Pittsburgh area with this motherfucker digging up all the bodies?

1378
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,500
 No.

1379
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,040
 There's a guy out here.

1380
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,320
 We talked about a heat bed for half hour and you're bringing this up now?

1381
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:44,800
 This guy, he dug up so many bodies.

1382
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,680
 How many bodies did he dig up?

1383
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,600
 He dug up babies.

1384
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,240
 He dug up old people.

1385
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,160
 Wait, is he going to cemeteries and doing this?

1386
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,160
 Yes.

1387
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:02,360
 It's in Philly and so he's breaking into these mausoleums and these old, what do you call,

1388
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,480
 you know, with the walls and all them.

1389
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1390
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,480
 The above ground stuff.

1391
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,480
 The Crips.

1393
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,480
 Crips.

1394
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,660
 So he's breaking into all these Crips and shit and this has been going on for years.

1395
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,680
 He's been stealing all these bodies and keeping them at his house and selling some of the

1396
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,360
 parts and he's just into all this macabre shit and he's got a fucking storage unit.

1397
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
 It's a living.

1398
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,600
 They just found out he's got a fucking storage unit with more skeletons.

1399
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,760
 I'd buy that for a dollar.

1400
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,920
 The police went and raided his house, right?

1401
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,080
 And the police chief came out like in tears.

1402
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,380
 Like my men shouldn't have had to see this and all this stuff.

1403
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:44,080
 Like there's body cam footage of the police in this house of horrors and of bodies just

1404
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,680
 lining the walls and everything.

1405
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,720
 And one of the policemen is like, is that a pacemaker?

1406
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:57,440
 Like they're straight up skeletons with, you can see, yeah, dude, it's outrageous, out

1407
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,180
 fucking rages.

1408
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:04,000
 How many skeletons he stole and over girl, he had some stored in his closet.

1409
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,560
 He definitely did.

1410
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:11,920
 And they found, um, they found him out by a couple of different methods, but one of

1411
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:18,520
 the key ways that they traced him, he was leaving energy drinks at the scenes.

1412
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:23,820
 Guess what energy drink he was drinking monster monster, exactly right, Matt.

1413
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,820
 Exactly.

1414
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,820
 You're right.

1415
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,820
 Yeah.

1416
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,820
 Finally.

1417
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:32,840
 Why are those questions of this scooperty drinking monster energy drinks while he's

1418
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,080
 stealing skeletons?

1419
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,880
 It's the creepiest shit you've ever seen.

1420
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,000
 They're all like super desiccated and mummified.

1421
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,240
 Most of them.

1422
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,080
 And it is something else.

1423
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,960
 So look, he's not keeping them in good shape.

1424
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:51,480
 I mean, no, he's, they're in their clothes and stuff, they're in their, they're in their

1425
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,640
 clothes and everything.

1426
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,440
 Just sitting in his house, man.

1427
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,160
 It's crazy.

1428
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,160
 It's crazy.

1429
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:02,800
 Like hundreds of people bought, he, he's on a million dollar bail and we talked about

1430
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,640
 masters of the universe for so long.

1431
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,640
 Paul, it's your turn.

1432
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,560
 Winter Olympics, geography or sitcom spouses.

1433
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,480
 It all comes back to Skeletor.

1434
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,480
 Let's go to Winter Olympics for 2000.

1435
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,480
 Daily double.

1436
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,480
 Yeah.

1437
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,480
 Now it's time.

1438
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,040
 Now it's time for me to win.

1439
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,400
 What is the only Winter Olympics sport in which women do not compete?

1440
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,240
 This sport is contested solely by men.

1441
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,240
 Skeleton.

1442
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:34,640
 If I get this with Skeleton, if I, yes.

1443
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,160
 If I get this with Skeleton, what's happening?

1444
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,000
 I don't think you're going to get it.

1445
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 Nordic combined.

1446
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 Bullshit.

1447
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,640
 This wacky sport involves a cross country ski race that follows ski jumping.

1448
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:55,200
 The farthest jumpers get the largest head starts in the race.

1449
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,360
 Let women do it.

1450
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,920
 How is that in the Olympics?

1451
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,760
 It's like biathlon type shit, right?

1452
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,600
 I mean, it sounds kind of like it, but that's even weirder.

1453
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,000
 This sounds weirder than the biathlon.

1454
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 Not the other way around.

1455
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 Chess is in the Olympics, right?

1456
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,280
 Breakdancing is in the Olympics for a hot minute.

1457
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,280
 I don't care.

1458
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,280
 Geography 800.

1459
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,280
 He's checking out.

1460
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,280
 He's checking out the cold.

1461
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,280
 Does Colorado share a border with Oklahoma?

1462
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,280
 Oklahoma.

1463
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,040
 Paul should yell Oklahoma into microphones now.

1464
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:30,880
 Do you remember, that's one of my favorite Saturday Night Live sketches with John Lovitz.

1465
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,000
 He kept saying, "Wedgie fever was the game show," and every time he got a question wrong,

1466
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,960
 they would pull the wedgie tighter on your ass, and he's getting pulled up by his underwear.

1467
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,320
 He keeps guessing Oklahoma incorrectly for everything because he likes getting his underwear

1468
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,640
 pulled, and he keeps screaming, "Oklahoma," and then he gets one right, and he's upset.

1469
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,640
 Oh my God.

1470
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,640
 I love it.

1471
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:57,000
 Matt, does Colorado share a border with Oklahoma?

1472
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 Oklahoma.

1473
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:07,520
 I don't know.

1474
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,720
 The frozen Indiana has broken Matt.

1475
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,600
 Matt is defeated.

1476
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,000
 Yes.

1477
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,600
 The frozen Indiana has done what that busload of girls did to me.

1478
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,600
 It is.

1479
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:26,080
 South Eastern Oklahoma shares a 34-mile border with the Western Panhandle of Oklahoma, which

1480
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,080
 is what Matt was saying.

1481
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,080
 Look at you, Matt.

1482
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,080
 Yay.

1483
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
 That's me.

1484
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,440
 I'll try sitcom spouses for 800.

1485
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,080
 What is the name of the character played by Gene Stapleton for nine seasons at All in

1486
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,080
 the Family?

1487
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,080
 I don't fucking know.

1488
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
 Pass it to me.

1489
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
 I know this one.

1490
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
 Shit.

1491
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
 Pass to me.

1492
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,080
 I know it.

1493
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:50,900
 I've heard you the first time, Paul.

1494
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:55,280
 Chong's, we're on your hit parade.

1495
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,640
 Now the things that something played.

1496
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,460
 What is it, Paul?

1497
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,040
 It's Edith.

1498
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,040
 Stapleton, Edith.

1499
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,040
 It's Edith Bunker.

1500
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,040
 I'm sorry, Paul.

1501
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,040
 It's Edith Bunker.

1502
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
 Bunker is the last name.

1503
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,840
 Archie, I don't know if I can take your last name.

1504
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,040
 I don't want to be a Bunker.

1505
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,340
 Hitler got shot in a Bunker.

1506
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,920
 I don't want to get shot.

1507
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,480
 Paul, your turn.

1508
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,600
 Will you stifle it, you dingbat?

1509
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:30,440
 I'll take geography for 2000, please.

1510
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,800
 What city is the capital of Pennsylvania?

1511
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,520
 Oh, Harrisburg.

1512
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,520
 Harrisburg.

1513
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,520
 Let's try it.

1514
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
 It's Harrisburg.

1515
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
 Yeah.

1516
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
 Look at me.

1517
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
 Shannon.

1518
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
 Matt.

1519
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
 Freedom Bell.

1520
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
 Geography for 1200.

1521
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:59,120
 Name any five of the 26 countries that have five-letter names when written in English.

1522
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,440
 Canada, Chad.

1523
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,840
 Not your turn and wrong.

1524
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,800
 France.

1525
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,520
 Iran.

1526
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,880
 Iran.

1527
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,880
 That's one.

1528
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,880
 No.

1529
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,880
 Oh, no.

1530
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,880
 Yeah.

1531
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,880
 France has five letters.

1532
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:20,880
 No.

1533
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,880
 Is it?

1534
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,880
 No.

1535
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,880
 Wait.

1536
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,880
 It doesn't.

1537
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
 It's six, right?

1538
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
 Yeah, it is.

1539
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:35,880
 I was like, I know I can't spell, but I can count.

1540
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:52,040
 It passes to me, let's see, well, there's France, clearly, there's Canada, there's Chad,

1541
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,040
 let's see, there's Egypt.

1542
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,800
 Oh yeah, there you go.

1543
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,080
 Columbia, no.

1544
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,080
 Columbia.

1545
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,140
 Oh, Italy.

1546
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,140
 Nice.

1547
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,140
 Sure.

1548
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,480
 That's two.

1549
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,480
 Sure.

1550
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:18,240
 Let's see, France, how many letters does France have?

1551
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,240
 Germany.

1552
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,240
 Farsi.

1553
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,240
 Farsi.

1554
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,240
 Sure.

1555
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,240
 Aruba.

1556
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,240
 Yeah.

1557
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,240
 Brazil.

1558
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
 Nope.

1559
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
 No.

1560
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:33,640
 Oh, what did you say?

1561
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,640
 Hawaii.

1562
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:48,840
 Let's see, Benin, Chile, China, Congo, Egypt, hey, I got one, got Haiti, India, a bunch

1563
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,840
 of them.

1564
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,840
 We didn't know.

1565
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
 Yeah, there's 26 of them.

1566
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,840
 There's a bunch.

1567
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,840
 Yeah.

1568
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,480
 Let's see, I'm just looking at them real quick now to see if I could possibly get five of

1569
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,480
 them.

1570
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
 Qatar and Spain.

1571
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,080
 Qatar and Spain and Syria, those are, those should have been.

1572
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,120
 I'm closing out the category and the game, sitcom spouses for 400.

1573
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,480
 What is the name of the character played by Florence Henderson for five seasons on the

1574
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,360
 Brady Bunch?

1575
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:22,680
 Here's the story of a lovely lady whose name we refuse to reveal and a man who has a last

1576
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,840
 name, but that is all we'll say.

1577
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,840
 This is Brady.

1578
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,840
 Here's some children.

1579
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,840
 Yeah.

1580
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,840
 They're hanging out.

1581
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
 All right.

1582
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:39,000
 So you had Marcia, you had Jan, Jan had little girl.

1583
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 Of course there was Opie.

1584
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,920
 Opie, Opie Cunningham, Delilah, Skippy, yeah, my, my, my Delilah, uh, pass.

1585
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:57,560
 Paul, uh, what was the dad's name?

1586
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,520
 That's not the question.

1587
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
 I know.

1588
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,520
 Alice.

1589
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,360
 Why are you trying to think about that?

1590
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:15,600
 Because it was kind of like the pairing up of, well, they called each other Mr. Brady

1591
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,480
 and Mrs. Brady all the fucking time, just to throw you off.

1592
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,720
 They were weirdies like that.

1593
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,960
 Florence Henderson, her name one Florence though.

1594
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,440
 Oh, I'm sorry.

1595
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,440
 That's time.

1596
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,440
 I have to pass.

1597
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
 Yeah.

1598
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,440
 Carol.

1599
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
 Carol.

1600
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,440
 That's right.

1601
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,440
 It was Carol.

1602
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,440
 It is Carol.

1603
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,440
 Brady.

1604
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,440
 Well, that is the game with that correct answer.

1605
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,960
 That launched himself into third place with negative 400 points, uh, I am in second place

1606
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,960
 with zero points.

1607
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,840
 Paul wins with 800 points.

1608
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:59,680
 That was a somewhat low scoring Smitty scooperty, but thank you Smitty scoop, but you got positive

1609
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,680
 points, baby.

01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,720
