00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:23,920
 Social sitting in Texas. That's Matt Donnelly sitting at Pittsburgh. It's Paul Manning Lee sitting in Las Vegas

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,000

 Which of course is French for the Red Stick. Yes. I'm excited to be here

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:41,420
 I'm in the west side of Pittsburgh, which is French for Aaron Rodgers can suck my balls

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:49,640
 This comes out we'll know I'm telling you

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:58,600
 The oh, yeah, yeah, so they'll be out the truth will be out are you expecting a Rogers Renaissance Matt Donnelly

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,200
 Here's the thing one. He's old and the only person to be able to play old is Tom Brady and no one else has been

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
 Able to play old, right?

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
 but

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,720
 You know Saquon Barkley came back from an Achilles injury last year for the Giants struggled

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,760
 Then got traded the Eagles and became an MVP candidate offensive player the year in Super Bowl champion

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,840
 Most people are better their second year back from an Achilles injury

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,520
 So if Rogers is going to be healthy last year's not a sign of way he was going to play. Yeah. Yeah

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
 Yeah, do you think he's got proof?

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,800
 No, I just think out of sheer karma like that

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
 We live in the most annoying timeline and the most annoying timeline thing to happen with

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,840
 Aaron Rodgers Renaissance would absolutely be oh my god, Jacob. I forgot to talk to my mic for the whole first

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
 Okay. Now. I have my mic up to my thing

36
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:55,180
 Fantastic I will I will patch something together between the recording the zoom -

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,640
 There goes sweeten it up Donnelly there goes all the trends we were gonna hit on social media

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:09,440
 No, the most annoying thing that I agree with you completely Aaron Rodgers having it being the comeback player of the year this year

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:17,440
 Just just goes along in line perfectly. Yeah. Yeah, I wish him no ill will but I hope he snaps like a twig on the first play

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 I mean

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,260
 His other Achilles does have the opportunity to do something really funny right now. It's true. Come on Achilles

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
 Do it

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,520
 Though I I wouldn't got I went to get into the truck last night to go to work

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,480
 SJ had left for the for the week. He's out of town until Sunday night and

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,740
 So I wouldn't got in the truck last night to go to work

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,440
 Got in hit the little it has a push button start hit the push button start and nothing happened

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:57,280
 Nothing happened at all. Yeah, like uh, the uh, like the lights didn't come on. No clicking nothing

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,000
 Just just dead ded dead. No, this is your gas

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,720
 Vehicle. This is the gas truck. Yeah, is it all gas?

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,200
 It is all gas. No, it's metal. I

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,160
 Mean some break some metal some oil

52
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,960
 Gas no breaks. No

53
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,440
 So I got in and it was dead

54
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,840
 So I had to uber to work and then uber home from work last night and then had to get up early today

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,720
 Because that's J's out of town. She has the other she has the car. Yeah, so I can't I can't jump the truck

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
 I don't have another car to jump the truck off of

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,280
 And so I I call roadside service. I call Dodge roadside service

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,080
 They very sweetly came out this morning. However, very early

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,640
 After getting out of a show at midnight boy, does that early morning come early? That is tough. Yes. Yeah

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,600
 and so

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,080
 He gets here. He puts the jump back on there. I say I don't know what happened. The trucks pretty new

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,480
 It shouldn't be having any battery issues, but uh, who knows let's see so he puts the jump back on

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,440
 Instantly everything comes on everything everything turns right on truck powers right up. Yeah, the battery was dead

64
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
 But I can't tell if it's charging or not

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,960
 Looks like it is though. And but he had another call to run to

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,480
 So and you said can you before you go put those on my nipples and give one more one more go

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,360
 Yeah, one more one more just hit the button clear

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,200
 Don't look at me. Okay, look at me

69
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,480
 Clean up my pants. I'm a triple-a member. I said clean up my pants. I need roadside assistance

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,400
 Come on I'm quadruple a I have

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,920
 Fourth a stands for the you know what the final a is in the backseat brother. Yes, sir

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,120
 Go ahead and find that. Oh, you had to come out and say it. I was trying to be all

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,400
 No, not me anal a states for anal. What are the other a stand for? I thought it was all supposed to be anal

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
 Yeah, yeah, it's anal anal anal anal anal if you have four a's

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,320
 That was five a's what company are you working with? Oh, dude, I've exposed the fifth a they're gonna kick me out

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320

77
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,280
 Jacob you have to edit this out and they'll kick me out. I just quick not don't talk into your microphone again

78
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:30,840
 It's actually they wrote the theme song to the second level of Super Mario Brothers for goes anal anal anal

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,720
 Anal anal anal. Oh my gosh

80
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,760
 That's only the triple-a. Yeah secret lyrics. Well, Jacob

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,220
 I I don't want to step on your story here. Those pipes goes right to the trip the 5a meeting

82
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,400
 I don't want to step on your story here, but I have a sneaking feeling that

83
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,360
 Since the technician had to go away quickly and wasn't sure that the battery was charging

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,240
 I have a sneaking feeling all did not go to plan now. I know after that

85
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,680
 Everything is fine. Everything is currently peachy keen really battery charged up

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
 I took it down to Autozone and

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,080
 And they they put the the tester on it and checked it checked it over real good

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,680
 And they said it was all all good get in the thing though Autozone anal

89
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,840
 When Autozone used to be called Auto Shack and Radio Shack sued them. Yeah

90
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,800
 No, who made them change the name to Autozone who's laughing now? Who's laughing now radio?

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,240
 They were called Auto Shack, huh? Yeah when you were a kid, it was Auto Shack when we were kids. It was Auto Shack. I

92
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,880
 Guess I have any other shacks in Kentucky getting a shack Auto Shack Auto Shack. Don't tell your parents

93
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,660
 The weird thing though was when he put the the the jump pack on the truck

94
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:56,520
 Everything turned on I like I watched nobody in the zoom laughed, but Paul on that one

95
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,240
 Which is fine by me, but I thought I got Paul is good

96
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,680
 Why just taking a drink too, yeah, it was dangerous

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,640
 No, the weird thing was everything though was turned off

98
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,700
 So like the radio was turned all the way down and turned off

99
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:23,560
 The all of the climate control systems all the air conditioners and everything was all turned off and the doors were unlocked

100
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,160
 But everything was like folded up and like the mirrors were folded up and everything like like it does when it when it locks

101
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,680
 So what we figured out was the new Dodge and I bet other new cars have this too

102
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,920
 Has like a power save mode. So if it is getting down to almost dead

103
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,640
 It'll start turning off auxiliary systems to try to save the battery

104
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,400
 So it turns off there. It turns down the radio turns off the radio turns off the climate systems

105
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,240
 Unlocks the doors just just so you don't get locked in or locked out or whatever

106
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,780
 It's like a Starfleet Starship that diverse like a Starfleet Starship. Oh shoot Paul beat me to it

107
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,680
 It's like it's all power. I knew you were gonna say it though. It diverts all remaining power to life support

108
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,600
 That's it. Yeah, just bare life support

109
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:18,480
 and so what we figured out was right before she left town SJ had unloaded a whole bunch of stuff from the truck, uh-oh and

110
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,360
 She had when she went to turn off the truck

111
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,140
 We think she might have double-clicked the button or something and just turned all the auxiliary stuff back on after turning the motor off

112
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:37,160
 And just left it running. Wait, is it a keyless car? Yes. Got it makes sense

113
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:44,320
 And so I think she turned the auxiliary stuff on left everything running. It looks like it ran for about nine hours

114
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,520
 Yeah, wow, but the battery held out for a really long time. It's pretty good

115
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,480
 Can that be good for your battery to run dry like that? If you just woke up early Jacob, you'd be fine

116
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
 You know if you just woke up a little earlier

117
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
 Well motherfucker I did today

118
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,280
 Usually I'm up for like 45 minutes before we start recording I've been up for three and a half hours today

119
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,360
 Buddy, I feel you in San Antonio every day and I just walk like a different direction

120
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,680
 See if I can discover they're basically just is basically I'm going to discover a place for coffee in a place for breakfast tacos

121
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,840
 I just have to go whichever direction. I pleased to find a new place

122
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,720
 right, and I saw the sign for coffee and I went inside there's actually this lush lobby of a hotel on this beautiful coffee station that

123
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,360
 was there and

124
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,260
 Then on the menu is clearly like put together by like a true coffee

125
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,280
 enthusiast all kinds of different drinks and syrups and that I don't normally see dirty sodas

126
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,960
 Basically a lot for dirty sodas and the really nice espresso

127
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,520
 Cappuccino machine, you know those real real deal machines. Yeah a lot of Starbucks push-button one and

128
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,720
 Ask the lady if I could have you know an Americano and a point of one of the syrups and she goes I

129
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,680
 Yeah, yeah, you want like a big cup. I was like, yep. That size is good. And then I was like pastries here

130
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
 What are these what are these things in the middle?

131
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 see, I I

132
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,640
 Think they're danishes

133
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,660
 Okay, was this like her first hour on shift? I go I

134
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,760
 What I didn't want to say but I go I also think they're danishes. I just don't know what

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,320
 You and I both recognize the circular shape but I was curious to the contain with the contain I

136
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:40,000
 Concurred doctor. Those are danishes. She's a cheese. I think cream cheese danish. I think that's stepped on cheese danish. That's super

137
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,360
 That's a that's a classic

138
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
 Let's give one of those a whirl then, you know, and

139
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,640
 So see that up. She's making my drink. She's pouring espresso over ice into my little thing

140
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,520
 and then I see her like almost look over her shoulder at me and then she just pulls out like a bottle of water and

141
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,140
 Pours a bottle water into my thing for the water for the espresso. I'm fine with using bottled water for my water for my

142
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,500
 But curious that this is very fine station doesn't have working plumbing

143
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:18,920
 And she goes it's it's it's bottled water she's like it's it's good water I said no, no, it's good go help yourself go for it

144
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,560
 I'm happy. Everything's fine. And then I

145
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,560
 Said brown sugar cinnamon brown sugar was the name of one syrup. I was like, yes, let's do a couple pumps of that

146
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,180
 two pumps, please and

147
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:39,280
 She's looking around she's like turning around every bottle and she's like I found a sugar-free one. It's like don't

148
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,920
 Don't worry about it. Just I bet you I bet you have vanilla. Yeah, give me two pumps of vanilla

149
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,760
 I bet you know right where that one is, right? She goes. Are you sure because I have the sugar-free brown sugar cinnamon here

150
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 No, no, no

151
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,080
 Did you find out if this was like somebody's kid or something was it was it take your kid to work day, what's that?

152
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,180
 Actually was using the kidnapped hand gesture and I missed it

153
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,040
 She kept asking you if you wanted an angel shot, it's quite possible

154
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,480
 There was a robber underneath the counter with a gun pointed to her the whole time

155
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,560
 You just weren't being nice

156
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,400
 You want sugar free? I?

157
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,880
 Think I have some more

158
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,640
 Pumping syrup with the brown sugar under the counter. I could just look under the counter

159
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:46,040
 If you take these out without paying for them they sometimes trigger a silent alarm

160
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
 I

161
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:04,440
 Have to come out now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry everybody. I have a gun

162
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:13,520
 The only thing I said I told this young lady was please don't tell this guy that I'm under here

163
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,360
 And that's the one thing you did I say I didn't

164
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,000
 Strongly implied I couldn't I just couldn't take it. Mr. Robber. Mr. Robber. I believe the second chances

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,120
 I have to go record a podcast. Anyway, I'm gonna leave and then you guys just start from one, you know

166
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,320
 Start from scratch when I go ahead. I don't even want to rob this place anymore

167
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,940
 I'm this is really just taking all this theme out of my sails

168
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:43,720
 The reformed robber

169
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,860
 Selective partners like the Helena Rubenstein foundation

170
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,640
 It's such a good feeling to know you're alive because I left you living though

171
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,360
 I was robbing you inside and I said, you know, not today. I will not shoot you then run away

172
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,240
 It's a good feeling a very good feeling a feeling

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,520
 You know that I'll be back to chase my fucking money bitch

174
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,720
 And if you don't have it this trigger is gonna itch and it's gonna go off and blow your head away

175
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,680
 I promise you ladies and gentlemen, welcome to mr. Robber's neighborhood. We're happy to see him

176
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,440
 He's just changed out of his sneaky clothes

177
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,560
 Wherever he goes near or far. I still don't know what danishes are

178
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,080
 What did you know so she goes to get the yeah the the French vanilla syrup right? Oh, yeah, here's the thing

179
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:53,440
 Baristas your syrup things you got to wipe or what if you have like the removable spouts you wash the spouts, right?

180
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,340
 Right if it's the pumps you still have to at least take it like a warm cloth at the end of the shift

181
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,680
 Or the beginning to shift to make sure you wipe those puppies down, right? Yeah wipe them puppies

182
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,080
 Mm-hmm. No, no, sir. Oh god. You saw the glomp just jizzes right in her own face. Just

183
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,160
 Like a joke at a naked gun, she just assaults her own face with

184
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:31,480
 Trying to make you a coffee man, she just wants you to have some coffee in a day

185
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
 Can I have some flavoring?

186
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:50,320
 Just and like literally was like I hate it's like literally with like syrup across her face goes like I hate these things

187
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,880
 Mondays am I right?

188
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,760
 And I was like been there girlfriend

189
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,000
 How do you think I started interning for Penn and Teller I

190
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,240
 Made them coffee. Can I tell you how I got these claw clackers? Let me tell you I

191
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:24,000
 Used to pick up pastries with my bare hands when I was first working here

192
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,880
 That was just a little too

193
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,620
 Grotesque of a thing to do so I I went ahead and got myself some tongs and I used those

194
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:44,120
 To pick up the bear claws and the pastries and the Danish and I was a fiend for the day

195
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:52,360
 Even though I didn't know what was in the Danish that was part of the fun picking up the Danish that I couldn't tell what was inside

196
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,120
 But I went ahead and ate it anyway

197
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,400
 And then I rigged all your fucking things to explode you

198
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
 I

199
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,800
 Was wondering where the story was going but now it was worth the monologue

200
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,800
 It was worth the fail they say he's a super criminal and I know I was the whole time

201
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,520
 I was like this doesn't sound terribly criminal at all to me, but then the ending though it took a turn

202
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,480
 It's all about the way like hide the syrup sheepishly showed me this container of cinnamon

203
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,680
 She's like this is like cinnamon and I go it is cinnamon

204
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,460
 It's like cinnamon. Yeah, she said it's like cinnamon and I was like like cinnamon

205
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,160
 I was like, that'll be great. You go ahead and you go ahead and clean your face. I'll throw some cinnamon in here myself. I

206
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,080
 Got it

207
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,920
 I don't believe that I can a good conscience ask you to do anything else for me

208
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,000
 I'm gonna see myself out. Please. Have a better day

209
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,620
 I don't want to leave this establishment with you having 10 drink additives

210
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,000
 Sorry splattered all over you because of my take that on my god

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,420
 No, this is just outrageous that she leapt onto the wall and stuck to it. Just

212
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:10,800
 You know who else thinks the walls when they jump at them

213
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:18,760
 The following sponsor today's show man Mally's ice cream social. First of all, shout out to Froyo who wrote why is so syrupy?

214
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,360
 Today shows brought to you by a vacation packages for nerds that's from Big Ben in 2021. That's vacation

215
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,920
 packages for nerds

216
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
 Hello there

217
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,100
 I know you're all dying to go on some kind of a trip or a journey or a jaunt of some sort

218
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,480
 Maybe go on to a balloon or a flying device

219
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,000
 What I'm offering is a trip that you can take with your loved one or your sibling or what-have-you

220
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,400
 And you could go to a place where they will love you and take you and embrace you. This is nerd

221
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:03,640
 Vacations brought to you by nerds who know the way to do it. Of course nerd vacations are all at home

222
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,640
 That's exactly what we're doing. We're gonna be at home and we're gonna play

223
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,440
 Magically gathering that's it magic the gathering. Of course

224
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,640
 everyone knows is a vacation unto itself taking you to the many varied lands all across in a stride and

225
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,600
 Phyrexia and all places in between

226
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,640
 You can only imagine the kinds of locales you will find yourself in when you are

227
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,120
 mid battle with your cardboard warriors go ahead and place them onto the the forefront and

228
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,320
 See how much mana you can deal damage to your opponent with and while you're there

229
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,360
 Just imagine yourself in the fields of Ravnica floating away on an island on your all your own

230
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,000
 Yes

231
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,520
 That's that's my idea of a really great vacation or hey, how about this for a nerd vacation?

232
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,480
 Why don't we plug in the old game system, huh? And let's go to a place. We all know it love

233
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,740
 Vice City. Yes, let's all go to Vice City for a vacation where the toots are plentiful

234
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
 And they can be beaten for the money

235
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,560
 After you do it so much it sounds like a trap

236
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,280
 This is definitely a trap

237
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,400
 I'm not saying that that

238
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,560
 Grand Theft Auto the video game is any kind of secret government sigh up

239
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,240
 But I'm certainly not implying that the new Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to actually literally entrap people into

240
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,920
 Virtual game world where they will be unable to escape

241
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:51,000
 Where they will be actually shackled to the game for many many hours of their day playing it to earn real-world money

242
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,320
 only to just spend that on

243
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:01,120
 Food and water delivered to their home because they can't leave because they have to keep playing the game because they're gonna be the game

244
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:09,720
 You say it's not gonna be that though no way no way

245
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,340
 We're gonna be utilizing actual in live players

246
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,240
 replacing

247
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,640
 NPCs that would be uncatchable

248
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,740
 No way as long as you're not gonna do that. I'm fine with it signed off. Don't check out you tricked us

249
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
 You super nerd you tricked us good

250
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,160
 Ha ha ha ha take a vacation bitch

251
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:38,120
 So I was doing fair enough

252
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,180
 Ended up, you know, I put myself on all these different

253
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:51,720
 Websites trying to increase my corporate work for magic. Oh, did we ever get resolution on your?

254
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:01,120
 Bachelorette gig did that they they canceled I was gonna do it and they canceled day. Well, there's the resolution they called off the wedding

255
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,260
 They put up a picture like this is who I'm going to bring in front of us at 10 o'clock at night in this private

256
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,400
 Suite and they say do you have do you have a cancellation fee? Yeah

257
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,880
 Nice, so you made a little money

258
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,240
 was it like I'm joining all of these sites to figure out my best practices and why I went through with this battery party was

259
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,200
 to make sure I could create a performance agreement Chad GBT and

260
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 like basically ask my shame best practices and

261
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,520
 And just yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna hire an entertainment lawyer for my $300 gig

262
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,120
 I get you on that one, but still

263
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:45,200
 The AI zombies are coming for us all. Oh, they are. That's true. I'm terrified. That is true. Yeah, I don't disagree but

264
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
 So same on a different website. I ended up

265
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,280
 Just

266
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,360
 Agreeing to do a birthday party in Redlands, California about three hours away from us

267
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,540
 Same thing I was going back and forth the person signed up agreeing to do it. All right, and so I I

268
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
 drive out last Saturday to a party in

269
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,720
 the Redlands, California and a beautiful backyard for someone's birthday and

270
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,800
 I'm doing a

271
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:25,600
 Rope trick right and I say that my I have a magic wand and it's a giant bowie knife. It's an eight ten inch bowie knife

272
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,360
 Make jokes about a game through TSA blah blah blah blah blah, and I always had it someone

273
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,960
 right, you know and say

274
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,440
 Do you believe in the power of this magic wand right and then I have them?

275
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,880
 Turn two pieces of rope back into one pieces of rope mirror. Huh, right? Yeah, and I get up this

276
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,520
 Person who's honestly I believe presenting mail. So I watch my pronouns

277
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,620
 Okay, and they're also seem to be with someone who also seems

278
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,560
 gender fluid in the back, okay, and

279
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:09,500
 So I hand this person the knife and say do you believe in the power of a magic wand and she quietly?

280
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:18,480
 Dead-eyes me and says I believe in the power of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh

281
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,120
 Ridiculousness and I'll raise you

282
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,840
 Say, you know, you know, it's funny about knowing how magic tricks work

283
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,920
 It's I know yeah exactly I know how con artists work

284
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:47,360
 I want to be like you are surrounding yourself with self-hatred. Do you understand this? There's a place

285
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,900
 Where you are free to be whoever you want and that answers anywhere, but a church community

286
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,600
 Let's just go let's just go have a nice life

287
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,620
 Part get the car part of the whole religious thing like

288
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,000
 The self-hating thing is a is a real deal. Yeah, it's it's it's legit

289
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,940
 I mean, I can't you and your partner you guys help me load out and we will go I'll take you to the gayest area

291
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,400
 I promise you will see Jesus in the back of the Piranha Club. Yeah

292
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
 He dances in there. Yeah. Yeah

293
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,140
 His name is Jesus and he will blow your mind. It's and other things. Mm-hmm. I

294
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,840
 Basically said fair. Do you feel like helping with this little magic trick?

295
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:54,540
 Sure, I'd love to not have that conversation right now

296
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,900
 Were they the celebrities my routine I have seven more to go who were they

297

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,400
 Okay, and she's a nurse that gave plenty of good humor to the arm chop routine and then

305
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,440
 Later on I get the couple right the the wife hired me for the 70th birthday party

306
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,760
 And so I'm gonna do the wedding a wedding ring routine with them celebrate the birthday guy and his wife

307
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,280
 Uh-huh, and I go how long have you guys been together and they're like, mmm ten years

308
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,240
 I was like, oh

309
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,400
 Now I know the awkwardness of the daughter thing. Yeah, got it. This is

310
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,520
 Daddy picked up a new a new piece of ass here. Yeah

311
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,640
 Daughter might not be incredibly thrilled about this is hotter wife. Number two is here

312
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,480
 Yeah, or could it be the other way around? Could it be dad is new dad?

313
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,440
 Or did she look just like her dad?

314
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,640
 She was not old enough to be the mom of the she didn't say I'm Amanda's mom or anything like that. Oh

315
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,800
 Yeah, what did she have a beard that gave away like she had the same facial hair as the dad

316
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,840
 That's it

317
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,800
 Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's a key indicator. I mean, I guess Paul is just really holding me to the coals here

318
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 I don't know. I

319
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,440
 Don't know is wait a minute. Wait a minute

320
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,320
 The last time I saw a birthday magician all he did was asking appropriate questions about family lineage. That's right

321
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,200
 This is like and his name was piff the magic dragon

322
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,720
 That is if you put on a dragon suit you can get away with more

323
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,360
 I want to end up following through with it

324
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,880
 You know, I did I said have you ever hired entertainers before and she said I have we hired a comedian

325
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 It was not a good experience. Oh

326
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,960
 Go like oh gosh

327
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,720
 You know and that's it and making me and snare myself into saying like well I can make up for that guy

328
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,880
 You know kind of was this this is before you started your show you as you were meeting them as the booking. Yeah the booking

329
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,600
 Okay, so this is well, that's good, but you didn't just show up at their doorstep go

330
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,920
 Hey, you ever hire anybody to do stuff like this before?

331
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,760
 And was it okay and were they wearing pants cuz I'm not

332
00:29:51,760 --> 00:30:07,160
 Is a blowin nice and free

333
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
 Uh

334
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,220
 Comedian was

335
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,640
 Chaotic runs writes in jet to be fair if a boy from Jersey thrust a boy knife at me

336
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,720
 I think I'd believe in Jesus - fair enough fair fair enough

337
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,040
 No, I did not ask who the comedian was cuz okay, there's no good either

338
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:36,040
 I don't know them or I do and that's are you do I don't and then I have to what am I gonna call that person up?

339
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,960
 You like absolutely Jason you suck, buddy

340
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,360
 No, no upside I don't think to knowing who it was and it's out in California, so I imagine if some guy from LA is actually

341
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
 okay, yeah

342
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,120
 But yeah, so

343
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,760
 Because of because of the reputation of a party magician. I was absolutely trying not to ask any questions

344
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,200
 To not clarify anything just like great moving on

345
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,680

 Ranch to come out and have have a meal with me. Oh, that's so nice. Great. Get out of here

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,660
 Where where do you guys miss this podcast?

 Where'd you go? So he picked me up and he says have you ever been to Rudy's?

392
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,480
 And I said no this Rudy's is a very famous barbecue place. I'm gonna take you the original location. Ooh, and so we go

393
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,240
 about 25 minutes out of town and

394
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,940
 It it lives up to the hype. It is attached to a gas station

395
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,440
 Yes, it is just built into the building. It is all bare bones

396
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,880
 Like there's no air conditioning. There's just fans going on

397
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,600
 Uh-huh. Yeah, you walk in and kind of like a cafeteria kind of lineup you order your sides first then your meats

398
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,640
 Seconds and their plates are pieces of wax paper. They have you yes

399
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,640
 Have just the brown paper. Yep

400
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,000
 The guy with the science is handing out small samples of the cream corn to let you know how today's batch

401
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,280
 Tastes. Oh, wow

402
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,240
 And so we're eating cream corn and we get some some briskets ribs

403
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
 There's chop brisket and barbecue

404
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:30,520
 And turkey it was crazy and you all just sit at these like big picnic tables

405
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,200
 you get a big bucket of soda and

406
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,880
 I tell you just superior to a microwave hot dog. Just so good

407
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,020
 That's a fancy new location

408
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,600
 Jacob the original one is literally just attached to a gas station like you see gas pumps on the side

409
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,240
 I can send a picture to oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah, let me see if I find the original. I love me some good burn ends. Oh

410
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
 Yeah, yeah

411
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,360
 And I mean getting you know that it you know when you go into those places

412
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,600
 You just see like the the plywood walls people putting food on to a

413
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:12,920
 Under a basket with some paper on it, but you know, what's gonna be the best thing after we did style switch

414
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,280
 The last time I was in Austin with my brother and I got their burn ends and it's just

415
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,320
 Really? Well done pork belly. It was just I yeah, I've regretted ordering

416
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:32,800
 The brisket. I was like I should have just doubled up on the burn ends because it was so fucking good like perfection

417
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
 they

418
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
 Yeah, and then

419
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,720
 In line he's about how rough to get ourselves a sausage these, you know, Texas barbecue place are always known for sausage

420
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720

 And they go. Oh, that's good. I can't wait to have a barbecue when I go my my podcast partner

422
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,600
 He grosses me out. He likes a like some microwave hot dog

423
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,520
 And Tim Jenison says

424
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,400
 Heats it up. Just fine

425
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,520
 Yes, I am in good company with super genius Tim Jenison and then I said

426
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:15,680
 He also does it with with bratwurst and Tim goes. Oh, no. No, no, that's terrible. You got a grill of bratwurst

427
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400

428
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,160
 Not an Aldi brat

429
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,720
 It barely counts as a bratwurst agree you're right you're right

430
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:34,360
 I believe Aldi brat is disqualified from the conversation. You and I both agree there. No problem. Yeah. Yeah, it is bratwurst asterisks

431
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,920
 You know what? I'll take I'll take half support for my preposterous dining habits

432
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,240

 Now here is the trick. I'm sorry. I'm sorry before we go here. We go here. We go. We continue this negotiation

462
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,440
 Always with the questions, huh? Are you are you French?

463
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,760
 What do you mean?

464
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,640
 I'm just curious about your accent. My father's name was Jerry Stevens. I am Bill Stevens

465
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:56,320
 Does that sound French to you? It does not sir. It does not. Okay, then I would not think that

466
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,640
 That needs any more

467
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,560
 Explanation

468
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,100
 You know, I I hear you saying that

469
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,020
 But I I'm very curious about this accent, sir

470
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
 Listen, here's the thing about

471
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,320
 about the

472
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,120
 This is the thing about in my place, okay

473
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,040
 All of the artwork is a god. It's on a waist level. Okay, and

474
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,600
 it's all got holes in it where there's mouths or butts and

475
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,680
 That's what you can insert your stuff in now. I have not a lot let out of the ladies

476
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,600
 Either I have another forgot about the the ladies what I have another forgot about the the ladies. No, I mean, I'm curious

477
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,760
 Huh? I heard you. I'm curious. Well, how you plan to help the ladies? Oh

478
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,400
 the lamps

479
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
 And her hey scoops a check

480
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:04,640
 Those are choking hazards, oh you don't put them in your mouth I

481
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:13,240
 Mean you can you can all right? You can do anything you want that sweet relief. I don't care

482
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:20,400
 My whole house because it's my house and it's filled with the calm of a thousand strangers. I

483
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,160
 Don't I can't get I can't access the back of the paintings

484
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,320
 They're built into the walls

485
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
 This

486
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,080
 Legal

487
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:48,840
 That my home reasons they'll take over my home reeks of bleach and sour apples. It's just a bad scene

488
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,680
 it's I

489
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,920
 The walls weep you understand me. I

490
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:02,760
 Have to take a moist towel to most of the walls every morning to take away some of the seepage

491
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,160
 And it doesn't stop and keep sipping there's a girl who works at a coffee shop who's looking to get extra work

492
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
 Do you think you can help her out? Oh

493
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,440
 I love a barista

494
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,200
 Bring her over

495
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,400
 You should use socks says chaotic in chat

496
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,840
 Oh too late I've it's in the drywall I

497
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,840
 Really should just replace the drywall

498
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
 Look, my only good thing is

499
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,120
 That it's at waist level. So at some point I could cut it all away and put like, you know

500
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,600
 What they call that design what they call the waist level?

501
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,320
 beams

502
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,080
 When they go on, you know at this point in the big you're asking for architectural specifics. Yes

503
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,760
 Okay

504
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,320
 Asking for a chair rail

505
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,760
 That's exactly chair rail and runner board. Is that what it's called?

506
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,200
 Sure, okay, great

507
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,040
 Well, funny is I want to bring up something that Tim and I talked about but now I can't tell me this is episode

508
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:23,320
 Next episode next episode. Well, I want to bring up something real quick

509
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,760
 It's too late

510
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,240
 Bad pirate scoop

511
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,840
 Sent me an amazing an amazing gift from Australia. He is friends

512
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,360
 With a creator

513
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,800
 Called salt

514
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,320
 Andrew salt marsh, I guess is the

515
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,320
 creators actual name and he does this art by salt and

516
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,960
 He made these really cool stickers and sent them to me. They're all

517
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,060
 Crazy Star Trek themes. So this is a bat left in a piece of pie. This is a good day to pie

518
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,920
 Or a good day for pie

519
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,640
 This is a

520
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,120
 doctor

521
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,120
 Which I believe just says hey in

522
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,560
 Klingon like hey, what is the doctor for our audio listeners? Which a doctor is a

523
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,320
 Klingon dagger

524
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,720
 Okay, it's a Klingon dagger with the word. Hey on it. Yep

525
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,920
 This is a zombie hand giving the Vulcan salute and says live long on it

526
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,040
 Which is that is you were just flipping off the camera

527
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,920
 Yeah, and then this is a red shirt

528
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:49,360
 What remains of a red shirt with a damaged calm badge and blood all over it clearly the victim and then I got a couple others

529
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,280
 That are beautiful stickers. They are and I've already put them on a couple of them on

530
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,320
 some notebooks I have that I'm gonna be using for the

531
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,640
 the upcoming improv classes that I'm about to start teaching this month, which I'm really excited about and

532
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,440
 I just wanted to say thank you bad pirate

533
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,320
 for that gift and I am holding on to the letter and

534
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:18,520
 The envelope because it might be the last piece of international parcel that I received for some time

535
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:31,320
 Well, there you go, there you go, congratulations, where do you where you want us to support this person? Yes, I would say

536
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,380
 Yeah, check out art by salt

537
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:41,460
 Salt Andrew salt marsh is that individual? They're an Australian and

538
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,680
 yeah, you can go check them out and

539
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,520
 Yeah, that's it

540
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,440
 Does really great work so I was talking to Tim and

541
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,960
 We were getting it, you know, he's he's he's a total like audio nerd, right? Right. And so

542
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:08,440
 We were talking about like the recording of sound and basically like I alright cuz he has like the Beatles microphone and stuff like that

543
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,960
 Yes, right. Yeah. Yeah, he's got some real real interesting shit. Yeah, and he

544
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,320
 And basically we just get into it. I was like I basically was like I was like I've had many people who understand audio

545
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,320
 Explained to me how we actually record physical sound into an object which I still don't get no matter how many times people explained to me

546
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:35,080
 What happens and he says it's even crazier than that is that there's like a French scientist one of the first known people to kind

547
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,080
 of figure it out and

548
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,920
 He was recording sound into like, you know, like like like cylinders

549
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,200
 it wasn't it wasn't quite that was like it was a really like loose like metal material like similar I guess would be like

550
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,520
 Tin foil now, but it was kind of like a very very weak probably pewter pewter, right something like that

551
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:58,640
 Maybe I don't have to look it up, but a soft metal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and that's the song was also soft metal

552
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,640
 No, but um, yeah

553
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,440
 But the person's first known recording audio is by this French scientist

554
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,800
 We gotta get a soft metal Jacob Alvarez. He just whispers

555
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
 Jacob soft metal

556
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,360
 Quieter quiet softer

557
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:27,840
 That's better and but it's still just full volume music

558
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,320
 The music is still just blasted take my hand

559
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,120
 So

560
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,840
 This is not a heavy enough of a story to carry the bit but

561
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:53,800
 But so so he said the crazy way

562
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,720
 How to record stuff I haven't gotten to the punchline yet. We've done too many bits in between

563
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,340
 He was definitely the punchline is he was doing it before the phonograph

564
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:09,600
 So before we had an ability to listen to what we were recording this guy figured out that we could record

565
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,920
 Yes, I have heard about I have I've been told

566
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,440
 Several times about how we we figured out how to record

567
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,300
 Sound before we learned how to play it back and Tim couldn't believe that I found this to be hysterical

568
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:30,840
 I was like wait, it's like everyone's singing and playing and then some some nerds going like see the wrinkles

569
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,040
 It's here

570
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,480
 Can we hear it no, no you can't

571
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:48,960
 We don't have that kind of technology you fools keep playing though. It's making the coolest wrinkles. How long?

572
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,400
 how long between learning to record and learning to playback I

573
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,720
 Don't even know I don't you even like they discovered that because they discovered this guy's recordings later

574
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,440
 They didn't know at the time

575
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,240
 He had done it

576
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,400
 So it was like it was like seriously centuries later where they found the recordings and then found a way to play them and sure enough

577
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,140
 you heard the voice and music of like basically a popular song at the time in France, which is

578
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,200
 Baffles me that baffles me so much digital sound makes so much more sense to me

579
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,320
 then

580
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
 being recorded into a

581
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,920
 Piece of I don't know I can I can wrap my head around analog sound a little bit better because it is you know

582
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,920
 It's just it's a needle

583
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,640
 vibrating it's the actual vibration of of

584
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,880
 Stuff and then

585
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,940
 Well, I mean it's the vibration of the needle against the groove of the record then amplified through

586
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:50,000
 The air which is what's the only when you get right down to it if we didn't have air

587
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,240
 We wouldn't have any of this shit. Yeah, that is true

588
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:59,720
 Take that you people take care for granted because it's all got to go through the air and the compression of air, right?

589
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:06,360
 Yes, I mean, I think that's what that's yeah, he's getting all kinds of crazy shit. That's a that above my brain

590
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,760
 Capabilities like he's vibrating air is above your brain

591
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,640
 For it to be like centuries later for me to take a needle to it and go

592
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:21,280
 Oh, there it is and then hear it like what sure I don't know there was about a 20-year gap between

593
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,560
 Scott Scott Scott de Martinville

594
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,600
 patented the oh

595
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,280
 Boy, I don't even know how to say what that word is. It looks kind of like phonograph, but it is definitely not phone

596
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,280
 It's pronounced autograph, maybe

597
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,520
 graph

598
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,760
 And it could transcribe sound waves as a visual line onto a piece of paper

599
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,360
 but had no mechanism for playback Scott intended the recordings or

600
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,760
 Phono autograms for visual study rather than listening to it

601
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:58,480
 So he was trying to invent something that could record the the sound so that he could visually study

602
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,480
 Oh, and then Edison invented the phonograph about 20 years later

603
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,680
 Say was it called phono phono autograms?

604
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,400
 Yes

605
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,500
 Phone autograms is it phone autograms or phono autograms phone autograms?

606
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:21,280
 Phone autograph was the machine and phone autograms were the things that the machine made phone autogram is a wonderful

607
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,660
 Mr. Burns kind of line. He would know he would he would drop that

608
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,960
 Yes, Smith is I recorded this onto the phone autogram. Yeah, exactly

609
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,440
 I recall I I had a recording of this on phonogram when I was a boy

610
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,400
 When I was but an adolescent is

611
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:47,120
 That means 20 years that's like enough gap for the people to come back they're still living right think back

612
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,400
 Hey, right. We're really dicks to you back at that early recording party you had and

613
00:52:51,400 --> 00:53:00,460
 Sorry, we haven't spoken in two decades since we ridiculed you but turns out you did and I have a recording of you ridiculing me

614
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:08,840
 We just figured out how to listen to it the world's first DJ the world's first DJ the world's first record producer

615
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:16,720
 Cuz that's what because we were talking about like basically that you had to play like such with such ferocity for the early

616
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,520
 Oh, it had to be so loud. It had to be out and then we figured it out later how to do it soft

617
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,080
 Like that's where you know, you're from from Bing Crosby to Sinatra to like that era of crooner

618
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,920
 Like we can't empathize with how much of a baby maker that was we cannot

619
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,200
 We can't go back in time to forget that we used to have to have such loud

620
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:45,740
 Things to hear it and all this everything had to sound like this because we were kind of shouting half shouting half singing me

621
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:50,200
 Am I baby? Yeah, and the very first time someone's like, you know, like the solitude

622
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,000
 You're like, oh my god

623
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,240
 That's fuck right now. Oh hard

624
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,240
 Knocked my son into next Wednesday for sassing off so hot being so yeah

625
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:12,520
 He made a wrong move at the corner of smart mouth and bullshit attitude

626
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,740
 so I had to correct that behavior a

627
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:24,160
 Wonder Bing's gonna be in Hollywood Squares at scoop fest. We'll have to find out who can say I don't know

628
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,400
 I'm really excited now now for those of you don't know we're I'm going in but lined on this

629
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,440
 So it's gonna be really really fun

630
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,000
 I can't wait to just not know what

631
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,120
 Impressions I'm supposed to do by the way scoop fest.com go check it out. Yeah. Yeah

632
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,920
 End of September end of the month this month

633
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,040
 Come on out to Las Vegas. It's gonna be awesome. It is

634
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,660
 Did you invite Tim to scoop fest? I didn't

635
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,400
 See now I actually mail specifically. I don't know Paul

636
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:04,280
 I know what you're gonna say, but I did in fairness to Matt already send Tim an email specifically tell him to stay the fuck away from

637
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,280
 scoop fest

638
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:14,060
 All right, I guess we don't want him is only really for one hot dog microwave er in this town. That's right

639
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:21,680
 After Matt told that story I just sent the email fun fact all you have to do to send Tim jenison an email is just

640
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,200
 Write Tim in the send bar and and it gets to it

641
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,680
 Who did I have laws dead? Laszlo might actually make it out to a scoop fest?

642
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,920
 Dead Laszlo come on. We love last-minute scoop fest tickets. Yep. Oh

643
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,760
 Yeah, come on out in the meantime we go play a little jock vs. Dirty

644
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,080
 Time

645
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:10,480
 Explosion

646
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,000
 Hey gang long time listener first time caller

647
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,040
 I made a scooper before you using questions that I pulled directly from a grade 4

648
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,640
 Brain quest that I picked up at a thrift store for those of you who aren't old

649
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,200
 Brain quest is a long skinny bundle of paper bound together with 1500 questions and answers

650
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,320
 Grouped into categories that was used to learn things in the pre-internet era. Hope you enjoy that's Johnny

651
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,700
 So Johnny made us a brain quest scooperty. Did you guys have brain quest? You guys know what that is?

652
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,240
 That's familiar. Well, it sounds like a

653
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,480
 Primarily Canadian thing since it was called grade 4

654
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,320
 No, no

655
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:57,120
 Canadian scoop crystal says I remember it first thing up in the chat. I'm telling you I remember

656
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:03,120
 Oh, I'm sure they made an American version. Nope. Jacob Paul gets full credit. You get none. Sorry buddy. All right

657
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,520
 Tough but fair. Hey the categories are before we get into the categories

658
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,940
 Let's say happy birthday to didgeridoo scoop one of my best friends. It's his birthday. Yeah

659
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,080
 Man, they buddy. Happy birthday didgeridoo

660
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:23,640
 Ah early days of this show having didgeridoo scoop make didgeridoo covers

661
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,880
 Famous songs. God damn the funny one of the best thing is that was ever done gold

662
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,080
 It's that is a truly gold bit. That is really funny shit. Yeah

663
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,360
 Talk about you

664
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:45,600
 So good so good

665
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
 It is right up there

666
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,580
 Science math geography and grab bad if you insist

667
00:57:54,580 --> 00:58:05,840
 Matt you're up first. I will take math for 400, please

668
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:13,440
 Which is it the better buy three shirts for 978 or 335 per shirt. Oh

669
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see here. I

670
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,840
 Have to divide 78 by 3 here three goes into seven. That's two times

671
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,240
 Yeah, nine said three shirts for 978, please

672
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:33,040
 All right, three shirts for 978 less than that. It would be 10. Oh five the other way around. There you go

673
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,400
 Oh, that was an example of the

674
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,840
 dramatic

675
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,240
 Pricing that's gonna be going on as you shop now at Walmart

676
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:47,400
 I'm just gonna randomly check up everything that you buy. I'll go with grab bag, please

677
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:54,860
 For 400 and the song what color is the Rose of Texas? That would be yellow

678
00:58:54,860 --> 00:59:00,920
 Yellow reading the question. I almost reflexively said what color is the yellow Rose of Texas hilarious?

679
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:10,680
 It's me I'll try science San Antonio stands for is yellow rose and of course the

680
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:19,480
 Arapahoe legend that the flower got its color from horses peeing on it. That's right

681
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:28,040
 That is what puts the yellow in the yellow Rose of Texas the yellow Rose of Texas is colored like that cuz it's pee

682
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,960
 That's right. That's how the song goes which two planets have no moons

683
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,040
 I

684
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,280
 Don't think mercury earth is one of them earth earth doesn't have any more moon is a myth

685
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:48,040
 Yeah, if you're flat, you can't have basically a spaceship. Don't sign twisted. Yeah, that's right

686
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:54,100
 Yeah, which two plants I think mercury is one and

687
00:59:54,100 --> 01:00:04,780
 Let me see Venus or Venus has a moon my guess Jacob and I'm not sure I

688
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,200
 I do recall pretty recently one of the planets got

689
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,420
 Re-evaluated and basically called the moon. So maybe that could work

690
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:23,480
 Or not even called a moon called like a large body. Yeah, Pluto's like a large celestial body or writing. Yeah, so

691
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,660
 what do you think I think it is mercury and

692
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
 He gets shit

693
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,160
 this is an old book, I

694
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,680
 think it's mercury and

695
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:47,280
 Neptune I don't know. Wait. No, it's an old. Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. It's Pluto

696
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,280
 It's gonna be mercury and Pluto. I'm thinking

697
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:55,160
 Well, you know, I was wrong. So Pluto has moons. I don't know or

698
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,220
 Yeah, or already not a planet by them though, maybe

699
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,000
 Matt you're up. I will take

700
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,960
 math for 800, please

701
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:14,440
 The sum of 16 plus 5 plus 8 is the same as the product of 4 times 7 true or false

702
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,140
 Let's see here 16 plus 5

703
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,520
 that's 21 plus 8 is 29 and

704
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,260
 4 times 7 is 28. So it's false

705
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,160
 false is

706
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:35,480
 Correct 29 is not the same as 28. I'm literally showing my math. Are you smarter than a fourth grader? I

707
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:42,440
 Will try grab bag if you insist

708
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,240
 Here we go

709
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:55,320
 Long fellow wrote the song of Hiawatha. Is it a short story or a long poem? It is a long poem

710
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,960
 It is a long poem

711
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:05,680
 That's me I'll try math for 1200 Fanny. Well Hiawatha

712
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,440
 And how well is mighty warriors of 24?

713
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:16,200
 Let's see 24 divided by 8

714
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:22,640
 Thanks

715
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,800
 We're divided by oh wait, how do you do that?

716
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,120
 Multiply 3 times 8

717
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:35,000
 Right, oh that's right. Yeah, so that would be yeah, so

718
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,520
 3/8 of

719
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,520
 24 wait, I

720
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,960
 Am just so confused right now. I don't know why you did

721
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,720
 Make any sense at all

722
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:52,640
 No divide 24 by 8. Yes, that's what I was doing

723
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,320
 But then subtract 2

724
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,280
 Or it would be 12. So it'd be 9

725
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,160
 Yes

726
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,240
 Well done boy, it is hard to do math and pull telling me things already confused

727
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,480
 I will take math for tooth

728
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:21,960
 2000, holy crap using pencil and paper divide $50 and 40 cents by 14

729
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,160
 Matt do you have a pencil and paper handy?

730
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:37,360
 You have a calculator because that would work too am I allowed to use the calculator probably not

731
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,800
 Okay

732
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,280
 Let's do this. Okay, so I'll try by multiplying 14. So times 2 is 28

733
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,080
 which means times 4 is

734
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:51,260
 56 so it's somewhere between 3 and 4

735
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,960
 So if I say 3 point something something does that count for this this yeah to get us on with the game. Yeah

736
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,600
 3.6. Okay. There you go. Yeah

737
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,400
 Paul

738
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,200
 grab bag, please

739
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:13,320
 For 1200 name the main villain in the series of unfortunate events books uncle Olaf

740
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,600
 No count Olaf

741
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,320
 Count Olaf is correct. Save my butt. Oh

742
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:25,480
 Is he their uncle I don't know I think he claims to be their uncle and they that's the whole thing but yeah

743
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,120
 Oh, okay

744
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,120
 I'll try grab bag 2000

745
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,360
 What is a pistachio

746
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:42,280
 Ooh, oh like is it a nut or a legume or a berry is it a berry? I bet it's a bear our I bet it's a berry

747
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:48,880
 Because it grows on trees, right? So I think that I think that means it's a berry so I'm gonna say berry

748
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
 That's a nut

749
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,700
 Boo

750
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,080
 Matt ah, boo. All right, come on

751
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,080
 Guys, come on

752
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,160
 science science for 800

753
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,100
 Now for 3200 oh yikes I was doing so well

754
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:15,800
 You were which creates the fastest wind on earth a hurricane a cyclone or a tornado

755
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,640
 Oh, this is tough. Okay. Their tornadoes are tiny

756
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,420
 But they're tinier, but I don't know if that means their winds are less

757
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:28,000
 Force frame more. Well, I think technically a hurricane and a tornado are the same thing

758
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,480
 It's just one forms over water. Nope. No, I quote cyclone and hurricane are the same thing

759
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:40,600
 Tornado and a water spout are the same thing right because a water spout is a tornado over the water hurricane and cyclone are the are the different

760
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,680
 coasts

761
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,400
 For us, I believe so, right? It's and it's the rotation the way they're spinning, right?

762
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:55,160
 Hurricanes in the Atlantic and cyclones are in the Pacific. I think so. That's vaguely what I know

763
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,440
 So if her kids are suckers the same thing it has to be one thing so I'm gonna go with tornado

764
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,400
 All right

765
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,520
 It is a tornado juice look at you with the big brain

766
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:17,020
 I may or may not be currently helping a fourth grader with homework all the time. So maybe gives me an advantage

767
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:27,320
 But I'll try science for 1200 name the only planet that orbits the Sun on its side. Oh

768
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:35,600
 What but

769
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,320
 What does that mean I

770
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:45,360
 It means that other planets are not on its side and one of them is oh

771
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,800
 Wait what

772
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,960
 There's some planets because you have like you have the magnetic poles

773
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,000
 So I think that's what it's referring to is it referring to the axe the tilting of the planet

774
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,320
 Or is it referring to what side of the Sun it rotates around?

775
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:12,080
 No, because it rotates around the Sun it doesn't just rotate on one side I have to pass I have no idea

776
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,400
 Passes to me. I'm pretty sure it's Uranus

777
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,920
 It is Wow

778
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,600
 It's just like it's it's tilted way over on its axis interesting

779
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:30,120
 Okay, I think it's I think I think it's part of why Uranus has such an odd orbit

780
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:34,320
 Also, the planet goes around the Sun in a weird pattern. Okay

781
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:42,580
 Because of that because of its rotation, right and tilt on its axis interesting. Okay science for 2000

782
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:49,600
 All tropical fish live in salt water true or false. Oh, this is this is a tricky. Oh

783
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,880
 false

784
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,620
 It is false something's live in freshwater. There you go. There you go

785
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:03,520
 Matt you got geography that we have all avoided for four eight twelve and two thousand

786
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:11,000
 Give the word for the farthest edge of a settled territory

787
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,200
 Over yonder

788
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:21,260
 That's the ball border Oh

789
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:26,480
 Frontier ass

790
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,160
 Nope frontier

791
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,160
 Paul

792
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:38,200
 Can I try the 2000 just to try and win? Yeah, I don't even know if I can win you can't

793
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,600
 Shows the location of a city that is not a capital

794
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:53,840
 Go ahead Paul what map symbol Paul actually go ahead and just name a map symbol dots

795
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,960
 Letters

796
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:05,840
 I mean it's been an arrow that says city been a minute since I used a

797
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,360
 Map

798
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,200
 And it's not a capital. Oh

799
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:21,600
 You remember the old bit that was in like every third movie where you'd have a couple of people lost in a car somewhere

800
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,520
 And one of them would just pull out the biggest map in the world

801
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:30,520
 I would just keep unraveling the whole front seat wasn't that a good in Dumb and Dumber where they had to keep flapping open the

802
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,900
 Or not dumb. Yeah Dumb and Dumber. I think it was I don't know

803
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:39,340
 I'll have to pass because I really am at a loss. That's to me. I just I certainly don't know I'm at

804
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,280
 the location of a city that is not a capital it's just a dot

805
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,760
 microphone

806
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,360
 It's just a black dot. I believe I said dots

807
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,320
 You want to try black dot? Yeah

808
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:57,400
 All right a black dot and fuck me

809
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:02,280
 That was the first thing I said shit ass

810
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,720
 That's me I'll try geography for 800

811
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,640
 Put an order from east to west Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama

812
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:18,380
 Alabama is the farthest east then Mississippi then Louisiana then Texas

813
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,560
 Alabama Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas well done

814
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,600
 Matt I'll take geography for 1,200 Jacob

815
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:37,360
 Which is the world's largest body of fresh water Lake Superior or Lake, Victoria

816
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,520
 Well, I have to guess here cuz I've won the game. Yes

817
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,960
 Yeah, you win no matter what I guess although if I pass who does it who's the pass to?

818
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:51,600
 Passes to Paul. Oh good. Then Paul can try to beat you for second place if I pass can I that's true

819
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,940
 Mm-hmm. I think yes, you can I'm 800 points ahead of you Paul. All right for game a $1,200 question for gamesmanship. I pass

820
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,720
 Paul I'll go Lake Victoria

821
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:09,160
 It's Lake Superior in Africa is second-largest Paul is wrong and that is the game

822
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:15,120
 Matt wins with 8400. I am in second with 2800 over Paul's best efforts

823
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:21,000
 He only got 800 points not my best efforts and that is from Johnny. Thank You Johnny

824
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,580
