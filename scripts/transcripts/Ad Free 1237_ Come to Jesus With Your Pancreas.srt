1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 Oh, it's all just great, and everything's taking along just fine. There are no problems anywhere.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
 Here we go!

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,400
 Oh, hello there! I am so glad you're here. I would love to thank the ice cream truck

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,880
 drivers right now. Thank your ice cream truck drivers. Who are the ice cream truck drivers,

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:29,580
 you ask? Well, these are the people that deliver that frickin' ice cream straight to your frickin'

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,320
 face. Right now I'd like to thank Bearded Scoop 3, Blue Line Scoop, Christine Elsesser,

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,040
 Christie Salinas, Darren Cunningham, Darth Scooper, David Walker, Ted Laszlo, and Dirty

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,440
 Old Scoop. If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks, head

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,080
 over to PreachingFun.com. PreachingFun.com is where you can go to sign up to be an ice

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:57,080
 cream truck driver, and who knows? The life you saved may be your own.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,280
 Yeah, I cut that off a little too early. Sorry, here's the show.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
 Hey, Johnny! Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 Yeah, I'd love to!

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
 Great! Let's go!

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
 Oh, I've got a big problem.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
 What's that?

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 I have a Sam's Club membership, and that's always been the closest big-box store to my

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
 house, but now a Costco is opening up.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
 Oh, whatever.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
 And they're almost equidistant.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
 Selfie choice.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,040
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social. Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,040
 Donnelly. Sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly. Sitting in Las Vegas, it's

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,040
 me, Jacob the Audio Guy. We're PreachingFun.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,040
 Speaking of Selfie's choice, I went and saw Fantastic Four.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 Right? This is something I want to talk about. Marvel film fatigue is fully setting in.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,040
 Is Fantastic Four Marvel? I guess it is. They're original Marvel.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,040
 The first family of the Marvel Universe. King Kirby's grand creation. Jiminy jumped up

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Christmas. Oh, Lord.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,040
 Boy, for somebody that was really upset about the Fantastic Four a minute ago, you are very

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
 defensive of their origins.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,040
 I'm not upset about it. I didn't see the movie yet. Although, well, we'll see.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
 Go ahead, Matt.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
 I was upset I texted you guys in the middle of the movie.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 I know you were really upset. This was hurting your soul.

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,040
 Paul and I got a text message from Matt in mid-film.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,040
 So, you took your kids to go see Fantastic Four.

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,040
 Yes. I was a group of two other parents and a total of six children went to see Fantastic

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,040
 Four together. Summer blockbuster. Time to get out in the theaters and enjoy ourselves.

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 First scene is a pregnancy test. Just her just hanging over a pregnancy test. And I was

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,040
 like, oh, no, I really don't want this to be about a baby.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 Oh, you're in luck, I guess.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,040
 And then, it's like straight up with like all of the, like as if they made it for parents,

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 like as if the kids were maybe secondary to the summer blockbuster thing. They thought

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
 maybe a lot of parents, a lot of moms would come out and want to see scenes about like

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,040
 losing sleep and like who's going to take care of the baby and all this other stuff.

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,040
 And is he normal? And let's look at the scans. And I was like, who is this for?

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
 Jesus.

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 Who is this for? And then, they're like, uh-oh, Galacticus, we got to go talk to that guy.

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,040
 Let's get the pregnant lady into the spaceship and get her out in outer space. Let's make

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
 sure that she's leaving the planet.

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 This seems like a good job for the pregnant lady.

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,040
 To visit a planet eating being and see if he wants to just talk to a pregnant lady.

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,040
 What? Like why? What are you doing? They're talking about how they struggle to get pregnant.

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,040
 All the things that like bring back all the, like, you know, as my friend Matt told me

56
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,040
 when your first year of pregnancy, your first year of the kids on Earth, it's, he called

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
 it baby-nam. You're in baby-nam.

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 Right.

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,040
 So, you want to be reminded of like the time you basically went crazy and lost sight of

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,040
 everything that was happening in the world for a year. Let's make sure we get that nostalgic

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
 back in here.

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
 Right, good.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,040
 And then, and then Galactus wants that baby.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
 Oh.

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
 That's, that's the deal. He won't eat Earth.

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
 Wait, wait.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
 He won't eat Earth.

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 So out of all of the, out of all the babies that could have been shot up into outer space

69
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
 to talk to Galactus, we happen to shoot up the right one?

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
 Yeah, because he's the child of two superheroes. So he's special.

71
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
 Wow. That is lucky for us.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 Well, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll.

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 So I assume they just sacrifice the baby and Galactus goes away and everything is fine

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
 from then on.

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
 I'll step in as a...

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
 Because the good of the many outweighs.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,040
 As a comic book nerd again, I have not seen the film, but I...

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
 If it's fucking canon, it'll give a shit. If it's fucking from the original author,

79
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 if the fucking genius from Marvel's Cradle was like, "No, this is sacred script. I don't

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,040
 give a fuck. I brought my kids to a summer blockbuster and watched them watch two hours

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 of whether we should or shouldn't sacrifice a baby."

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 Yeah. No, I think that's a stupid move.

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,040
 Now, the only, my only defense, and this is a very weak defense, but in many incarnations...

84
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
 What do you think, Marvel? Should we sacrifice this baby?

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
 In many incarnations...

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
 I don't know.

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 Franklin, the baby, they did call him Franklin, right?

88
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
 Yes. Yeah.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,040
 Okay, great. At least they stuck to that. Franklin Richards does become a super genius,

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 capable of manipulating multiverses. So there is something of the, of a, you know, he's,

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,040
 he's a keystone character, or you know what I mean?

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,040
 I understand, but you know what? This is the same argument when fucking, we spent all of

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,040
 Black Widow setting up the fucking Cannonball family. What are they called?

94
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
 That's it, Cannonball family.

95
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
 With Red, Red Tornado or whatever his name is?

96
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
 No, no, the movie that just came out. Well, the other movie that just came out.

97
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
 The Thunderbolts.

98
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,040
 Thunderbolts. So I went to see, I want to see Scarlett Johansson kick ass as Black Widow,

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,040
 and they spent half that movie setting up the Thunderbolts movie, a movie that wouldn't

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,040
 come out for another three years, so thanks for the prequel, and then, great.

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,040
 Well, I keep in mind too, when they first made the movie, because remember they held

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
 the movie, they held Black Widow for a year, so when they made it, it wouldn't have come

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
 out for four years.

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 So it's like, well, I don't, I don't need to keep this like encyclopedic, like checklist

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,040
 of like, oh good, when I'm watching a film, like if it pays off, great, if it has a building

106
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
 up, great, great.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,040
 When the Robert Downey Jr. first Iron Man came out, you didn't sit on your hands during

108
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,040
 the movie going like, yes, but what are they going to do with vision?

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,040
 Okay, here's a, play music or something, Jamie, here's a big spoiler, so play music

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
 or something.

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
 Oh, okay, we got a big spoiler coming up here.

112
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,040
 Those in the chat who don't want to be spoiled, avert your ears.

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,040
 Yeah, yeah, so I'm going to play a little music by the time the music ends, fast forward

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
 until you don't hear the music anymore.

115
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
 When I go like this again, you can come back on if you don't want spoilers.

116
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
 There you go, all right, spoilers.

117
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,040
 They show her fucking dead for like two minutes, Sue Storm, like dead on the ground.

118
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 Oh, the invisible girl?

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,040
 Fucking dead, like on the ground, fucking Pedro Pascal weeping over her dead fucking

120
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 body, like true fucking death scenes, and then finally bring the baby around so that

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
 the baby can start showing his powers for the first time.

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,040
 That's like punching someone in the face and saying, just kidding, like you can't, like

123
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,040
 you made a bunch of children look at a dead woman on the ground for two minutes.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
 Like, fuck off.

125
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,040
 It sounds like the first Pokemon movie, honestly.

126
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 Oh, the Pokemon movie had lots of dead women in it, but that is canon.

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 Do you remember the first Pokemon movie?

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 Did you ever see the first Pokemon movie?

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I watched the first Pokemon movie again last night.

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 I'm not talking to you, Jacob.

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 I know you never saw the first Pokemon movie.

132
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
 No, I rewatched it again last night.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
 It was great.

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 I loved it.

135
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
 All of the dead women, it doesn't bother me.

136
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
 The dead women in the Pokemon movie does not concern me at all.

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 Matt, you probably missed the first Pokemon movie, too, because that was a little bit

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 after the boys.

139
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
 We did not get into it.

141
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 They collect the cards, but they're not really into any of the ...

142
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,040
 So, spoiler for the 20-plus-year-old Pokemon movie.

143
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
 Yeah.

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
 Ash dies.

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
 What?

146
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
 He dies.

147
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
 What?

148
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:22,040
 And then the Pokemon start crying, and their magical tears bring him back to life.

149
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,040
 So, it sounds like they just ripped off the Pokemon movie from 20 years ago.

150
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
 Yes.

151
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,040
 Look, I guess we can say thumbs up to rejoin, because we'll talk about it more vaguely or

152
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
 whatever.

153
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
 Yeah.

154
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
 But ...

155
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
 Oh, scoopernova girl says that he dies in every movie.

156
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
 Ash knows he doesn't die in every movie.

157
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
 Does the mate ...

158
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
 Oh, okay.

159
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
 Yeah.

160
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,520
 No, I mean, there are more dead parents in Disney's canon than there is in every horror

161
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
 movie franchise.

162
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
 Disney loves killing fucking moms and dads.

163
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
 They do.

164
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
 The canon is how they get rid of the bodies.

165
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,480
 They put the bodies in the canon, and then they get rid of the bodies.

166
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,680
 And the circus ripped that off, so who's ripping off who?

167
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 And the truth is, my kids didn't give a shit.

168
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,480
 They just liked watching Fantastic Four.

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 R-Tax.

170
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,960
 Winner scoop, fucking R-Tax.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
 Yeah.

172
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
 It is R-Tax.

173
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
 It is R-Tax time.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,640
 My kids didn't give a shit.

175
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
 They watched the movie.

176
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
 They were fine.

177
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
 Yeah.

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 Or whatever.

179
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 Did they like it?

180
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 They did like it.

181
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
 They did not love it.

182
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 Okay.

183
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
 Right.

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,600
 I will tell you that it was the second movie we saw over the weekend.

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
 Oh.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
 And the first movie we saw was Naked Gun.

187
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 Oh.

188
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 Ah.

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 How did that go?

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
 I bet they liked Naked Gun.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
 They loved Naked Gun.

192
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 Yeah.

193
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,920
 They were just crying out loud laughing.

194
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,480
 And this is why it's so funny that we're so cool with violence and so anti-anything that

195
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,520
 might whiff of sex, you know?

196
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
 Yeah.

197
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
 Right.

198
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,240
 I would take my kids to Naked Gun again tomorrow.

199
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,800
 They were laughing so hard.

200
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,160
 Yeah.

201
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,200
 First of all, Pamela Anderson's really good at it, which is something I was not expecting.

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
 Yeah.

203
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 Like I expected her to be fine.

204
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
 Oh, yeah.

205
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
 I heard she's great.

206
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,800
 She's like really funny in it, which I've never seen her be in other things.

207
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 I didn't see it.

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,520
 It certainly seems that as she's getting older, she is accepting more and more, just like,

209
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,680
 "I can just be funny.

210
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
 This is great."

211
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
 I do think it's a thing about character.

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,320
 I think as she got older, she's no longer this bombshell, so she's allowed to say things

213
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 differently and feel things differently.

214
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 Yeah.

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
 Like it's on us, is what I'm saying.

216
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 Like she doesn't have to worry about that?

217
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
 Oh, absolutely.

218
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 Absolutely.

219
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 Yeah.

220
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 Oh, I agree with that.

221
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,080
 She and Liam Neeson are a item.

222
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
 They kissed on the red carpet, Paul.

223
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
 Right.

224
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
 Scandal.

225
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
 I mean, not scandal.

226
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
 It's adorable.

227
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
 It's a showmance, Matt.

228
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
 It's a showmance.

229
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,000
 It is, but no, it's one of those things like in the movie, his character's a widower and

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,960
 he falls for her in it, and in real life, it's the same.

231
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,760
 But that movie was, I mean, that movie's just a million jokes a mile a minute.

232
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
 It's what it's supposed to be.

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,800
 Some people I've heard speak a little snobbly about it, and I'm always like, "What were

234
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 you expecting?"

235
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 Yeah.

236
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,260
 It's a naked gun.

237
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,680
 And I mean this like, not to be overly dramatic, but I remember after 9/11, I was in the New

238
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
 York improv scene, we're all very big comedians out.

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
 Good.

240
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 I'm glad we're not going to be too dramatic.

241
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
 Not to be too dramatic.

242
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:38,920
 But I remember John Bowie saying, "I used to not get the three stooges, and I get the

243
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 three stooges now."

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 Okay.

245
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,680
 He was like, we were all at the UCB, we were all trying to do our own version of sophisticated

246
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,920
 improv comedy for whatever that's worth, and sketch comedy, and just like these stupid

247
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,520
 nang, nang, nang, and weird pratfall stuff.

248
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,040
 And after, he said he just found himself watching it right after 9/11, and it was like, "Oh,

249
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
 this is so soothing."

250
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 Right?

251
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,960
 I've been told that about the new Naked Gun movie, that it is that old school, because

252
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,520
 I haven't seen it yet, but I've been told by multiple people that it's that old school,

253
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,640
 like we're just going to get up and we're going to do a bunch of stupid bits and tell

254
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,440
 a bunch of jokes, just a joke a second, nothing's ever going to come out of our mouth that isn't

255
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,680
 a joke.

256
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,840
 And I've been told it's just so irreverent and not trying to deal with issues, and it

257
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,960
 is just like an old school checkout.

258
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,240
 Like, you just go check out at the movie theater for an hour and a half, two hours, and just

259
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
 have a nice time.

260
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
 Yeah.

261
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
 Is that fair?

262
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
 Totally.

263
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,860
 It's total escapism, just a crazy amount of jokes on every level, from the dumbest jokes

264
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,840
 to like really funny, like long bits.

265
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,280
 Great.

266
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
 Really good.

267
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,880
 And I just was like, and you're right, Jacob, and that like, I used to like, when Airplane

268
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,840
 and Naked Gun were like part of like our regular lives when we were younger, I used to even

269
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,480
 talk about it in improv classes, like the idea of like stakes to jokes.

270
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,520
 Like, if you want to have the most fun, you have to have high stakes, right?

271
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,200
 And then I had to stop saying that because I started teaching people younger and younger

272
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,720
 than no one had ever watched those movies at a certain point.

273
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 Oh, yeah.

274
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,440
 And then there was the Children's Hospital was the only kind of slapsticky thing around

275
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,680
 to like illustrate that point.

276
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
 And then all of a sudden, and now-

277
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,400
 Matt doesn't mean the TV show, he means an actual children's hospital that was down the

278
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,200
 street from where he taught.

279
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,720
 But yeah, the whatever Adult Swim Show.

280
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,640
 But yeah, you know, there just wasn't that that slapstick style.

281
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,480
 I was like, I remember, I remember even like literally with my children trying to explain

282
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,040
 what slapstick was, and like being like, shit, I don't have any concrete examples.

283
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,640
 But yeah, they're getting hurt, but it's funny.

284
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
 It's really sophisticated.

285
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,140
 I'm sorry, kids.

286
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,040
 So they were just crying, laughing, and they got in the car, and they were debating whether

287
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,240
 it was the funniest movie they'd ever seen.

288
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
 Good.

289
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
 So I guess-

290
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 What were the other contenders?

291
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
 Ace Ventura.

292
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
 Great.

293
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,720
 That's a that's a good, good entry.

294
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
 They really liked Ace Ventura.

295
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,520
 That's a crazy movie.

296
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,120
 It is a joke in the house to do the thing with the sliding door like, oh, yeah, yeah.

297
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
 Good.

298
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
 Good.

299
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
 Oh, yeah.

300
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,800
 Scoop of Monte Cristo in the chat wants to know, will you show them the original Naked

301
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 Gun now?

302
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 I think so.

303
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 I think now-

304
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 I think so.

305
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 I think it'd be good.

306
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,640
 I think it's a place where, at first we used to worry about the show and certain things.

307
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,080
 Our kids watch The Simpsons all the time, and I guess other kids aren't allowed to watch

308
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,440
 that so they come over and they're not allowed to watch it.

309
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,640
 And so it was funny because my kids are just, they're not, they know how to negotiate, basically.

310
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,960
 They're not, they're sophisticated craftsmen of the deals.

311
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,160
 So the next morning they're like, oh, Family Guy's on the channel, dad, can we watch Family

312
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
 Guy?

313
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,160
 And I was like, oh, man.

314
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
 It's like-

315
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
 The slippery slope has begun.

316
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,920
 It's like you can't put the genie back in the bottle, right?

317
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,160
 And I was like, if they watched all the Naked Gun stuff-

318
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,520
 Well, can you, you can start them off with Police Squad.

319
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,880
 I really, I mean, that's the thing is I think we should just watch that because yeah, there's

320
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,640
 like references to Police Squad in it that are direct that you're like, oh, if you know

321
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,560
 the reference.

322
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,920
 And Police Squad is one of those shows, it was very similar to like Get Smart and those

323
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,640
 types of shows where they really did like, it'd be a little bit different each episode,

324
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,920
 but each episode was basically the same jokes over and over again, which is kind of delightful

325
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,680
 and almost secure.

326
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,720
 Yes.

327
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,240
 Now like one of the writers on it, it was written and directed by one of the guys from

328
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,760
 Lonely Island, but one of the other writers on it is Dan Greger, who is Rachel Bloom's

329
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:04,000
 husband and already a very successful movie writer and filmmaker.

330
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,040
 But I still have his number on my phone from when he used to do the Neutrino video projects

331
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 in New York.

332
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,880
 And I was like, what if he changed his number?

333
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,040
 And so I just shot him a text being like, look, I hope you're getting a thousand of

334
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,560
 these texts, just left the theater with my kids, all of us just laughing our asses off.

335
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
 Yeah.

336
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,880
 And then for the movie to come out, I'm so happy it came out and everything else.

337
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,140
 And so we had a really nice exchange on that.

338
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
 So it was really fun.

339
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
 Oh, that's lovely.

340
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
 Yeah.

341
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
 Yeah.

342
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
 I said I was Matt Donnelly.

343
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:38,640
 So I knew I would skip the new phone who dis, get past that part, but it was a super, super

344
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
 fun thing.

345
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,620
 But yeah, very, very happy.

346
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,680
 So a lot of cinematic intake for me guys, a lot of cinematic intake.

347
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
 Yeah.

348
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:54,840
 So I finally got around to seeing Thunderbolts and I did not enjoy that film at all.

349
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,200
 Guestimating better or worse than Fantastic Four.

350
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,240
 I don't, I can't, I don't know.

351
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,680
 That's why it's guesstimating, based on what Matt has said, is it better or worse?

352
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,320
 I'm guessing it's worse than Fantastic Four.

353
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,960
 Oh, fight.

354
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,440
 I don't, I don't know.

355
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,440
 I've heard a lot of great stuff about Fantastic Four and I heard middling stuff about Thunderbolts,

356
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,920
 but I heard better stuff about Thunderbolts than I thought.

357
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,600
 Now problem is you talk about coming in with the comic book baggage, Matt.

358
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 Yeah.

359
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,000
 So spoilers for Thunderbolts, ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Oh, hold on.

361
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Hold on.

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Yeah.

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
 Let's get some spoiler music going for Thunderbolts.

364
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,560
 When the music ends, the spoiler is over, fast forward until you don't hear the music

365
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
 anymore.

366
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,640
 Thunderbolt spoiler.

367
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,560
 So Thunderbolts revolves around the character of the Sentry.

368
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,760
 The Sentry is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman.

369
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
 Okay.

370
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
 Ah.

371
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
 Are you familiar with this character?

372
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
 Not at all.

373
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
 Superman?

374
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
 Yes.

375
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,600
 Sentry is a relatively new invention and he's only, I don't know, probably not even 20-year-old

376
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,320
 character, I don't think.

377
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:12,240
 I have never enjoyed the Sentry at all because, just like Superman, it's hard to make stakes

378
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,560
 when you've got an invincible everything thing.

379
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,800
 So the only twist on Sentry is that he has a dark side, right?

380
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,240
 So he's like Superman, but he's also evil Superman at the same time.

381
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 He's like got mental problems.

382
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
 That's the whole thing.

383
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,680
 But it's like if they made Moon Knight Superman, basically.

384
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
 Gotcha.

385
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
 So.

386
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
 Spoiler over.

387
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
 Spoiler over.

388
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
 Yeah.

389
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:48,800
 So it's just kind of bleh, you know, not great with that, because again, the stakes just

390
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,340
 don't seem to be there.

391
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
 Right.

392
00:18:51,340 --> 00:19:01,160
 And the characters that I did enjoy, like Yelena, whatever her name, from the Black

393
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,840
 Widow series, she just, there's really nothing for her to do.

394
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,300
 She's just, it's all, and it feels very, it feels really small.

395
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,260
 The movie feels really small.

396
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,160
 Everything just feels like it's shot in like five tiny locations.

397
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,880
 When they do get it big, it's just to show some buildings falling on each other and nobody

398
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
 cares.

399
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,400
 It's just because nobody cares, because again, nothing, no consequence.

400
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
 Nothing happens.

401
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,840
 And according to Google AI, Fantastic Four is slightly worse than Thunderbolt.

402
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 Really?

403
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
 Oh, well, shit.

404
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
 I'm in for it.

405
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
 Yeah.

406
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,960
 Like, hey guys, we're kind of losing the handle here on phase four or phase three of the Marvel

407
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
 universe.

408
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
 Yeah.

409
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
 How are we going to write this shit?

410
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
 You're like, all right, there's a baby.

411
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,040
 And you're like, there's a pregnancy test.

412
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
 All of it.

413
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
 Yeah, all these ideas.

414
00:19:51,040 --> 00:20:02,440
 And the whole thing with, God, David Harbour is just so dumb in this fucking movie as the

415
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
 Soviet guy.

416
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
 Oh yeah.

417
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
 Yeah.

418
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
 Yelena's dad.

419
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,240
 And he comes off like he's trying to hit on her.

420
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,080
 It doesn't, there's no parental.

421
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,680
 It's just Red Guardian.

422
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
 Yeah.

423
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
 Ugh.

424
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 Just garbage.

425
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,720
 Anyway, I was really disappointed because I really wanted to like it and I did not like

426
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,960
 it at all.

427
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,040
 How old are the Thunderbolts?

428
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,320
 Are they a modern comic book introduction or have they been around for a while?

429
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,120
 I'm going to say that was late nineties.

430
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,160
 And you know, that was a whole thing where.

431
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,520
 So fairly recent, especially for us, fairly recent.

432
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,240
 But very different incarnation of who was in it too, sorta.

433
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,800
 I think, I think that the former Captain America, what's his name?

434
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
 Super soldier.

435
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
 I can't remember his name.

436
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
 Patriot.

437
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 It doesn't matter.

438
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 Mr. Patriot, whatever.

439
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
 I think he was part of it from the jump.

440
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,640
 You know who else Mr. Patriot was in?

441
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,040
 And that's the following sponsor.

442
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,640
 Today's show is brought to you by Skryte Extra Sugar, the Tooth Loosener.

443
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,120
 That's from Cool Yay, I like, I like glass.

444
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
 I go.

445
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
 Wait.

446
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
 Queer a glass.

447
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
 That's it.

448
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
 2023.

449
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,840
 The product, no problem pronouncing Skryte Extra Sugar, the Tooth Loosener.

450
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:32,000
 Oh yeah, it's me, the ghost of macho man Randy Savage.

451
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,120
 I'm here to tell you a little something about Skryte Extra Sugar.

452
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,800
 You ever have a tooth that's just not coming loose?

453
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's just not coming out?

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,560
 Well, I got the solution for you right here.

455
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,040
 You can get this out of your head, no problem.

456
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,840
 Cream rises to the top and so does the cane sugar.

457
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,880
 Go ahead and get yourself a tall glass of Sprite Extra Sugar and pour it in.

458
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,000
 You'll notice the thickening agents are going to work immediately, causing it to drip like

459
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,560
 sundae topping right onto your cold ice cubes.

460
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,920
 Go ahead and try and drink it.

461
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,440
 You won't be able to because it's 99% sugar.

462
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,860
 It's granulated for your pleasure.

463
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,240
 Go ahead and chew a Sprite Extra Sugar today.

464
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,080
 Gargle it down, bitch, yum.

465
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
 I'm sorry, did you say you're a ghost?

466
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,400
 I'm a ghost.

467
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,080
 I feel like that is the lead that we are burying here.

468
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,400
 What are you talking about?

469
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
 Yeah, we're talking ghosts.

470
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
 Talking ghosts.

471
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 I'm not the only ghost.

472
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 There's a ghost.

473
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 Advertisements?

474
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
 You're not?

475
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,540
 No, I mean this has been going on for a long time.

476
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,280
 I remember when Gene Kelly was selling vacuum cleaners.

477
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,720
 You know, you have an excellent point.

478
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,640
 Shoot, Paul Walker's about to start another fast movie franchise.

479
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 That's right.

480
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,440
 Brought to you by Scryte Extra Sugar, the tooth-loosener.

481
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,660
 Anyways, when we got out of the movie, I was like, "Should we go watch Sophie's Choice

482
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,840
 now or what should we do?"

483
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,560
 And so how did the kids like Sophie's Choice?

484
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,640
 They loved all the action.

485
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
 Good.

486
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,280
 Hey, speaking of Sprite Extra Sugar.

487
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
 Yes?

488
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,440
 Have either of you gentlemen heard of the new trend?

489
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
 Scryte!

490
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
 Scryte!

491
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
 Don't get sued by Sprite!

492
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 Nope.

493
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
 We're only talking about Scryte.

494
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 Did I say Sprite?

495
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
 I meant Scryte.

496
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 You said Sprite once or twice.

497
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
 Oh boy.

498
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 Well, whatever.

499
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
 It's all the same.

500
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 It's not!

501
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 That's the entire point.

502
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
 It's not.

503
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
 You're right.

504
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
 You're right.

505
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 Keeps us free.

506
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,040
 Have either of you experienced dirty sodas yet?

507
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,280
 Who's that?

508
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,600
 I want to experience this person.

509
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,680
 I went to Utah.

510
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,400
 There's all those soda places.

511
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 Yes!

512
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
 Utah is where it's popping off.

513
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
 It's a Mormon thing.

514
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 Yes.

515
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,200
 It's a Mormon thing.

516
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
 There are a few here.

517
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 It is a Mormon thing.

518
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
 And it is bananas.

519
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,040
 It's super bananas.

520
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,960
 It's spread out here now.

521
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:11,360
 So our little local ice cream spot that we go to, they have dirty sodas now and got one

522
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
 the other day.

523
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,760
 I got a regular milkshake and got a dirty soda and I sipped on that motherfucking thing.

524
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,440
 I am a fan.

525
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,480
 Of course it's crack!

526
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 Why wouldn't you?

527
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,000
 When we were kids we had Shirley Temples, which was like, "Hey, let's take the sweetest

528
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,900
 thing that you could possibly have on earth and then add a sugary syrup to it and mix

529
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
 it up."

530
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,480
 And when you look at the ingredients of these crazy crack sodas, it is just the most caloric.

531
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 It is insane.

532
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:52,040
 This one that she got was Dr. Pepper, mixed with raspberry syrup and I believe it's tangerine

533
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
 cream.

534
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,400
 Like, coffee creamer is one of the things that go with these.

535
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
 Creamer is a big thing.

537
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 Yeah, yeah.

538
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
 So coffee creamer goes into it.

539
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,100
 Canadian Scoop Crystal asking about the dirty.

540
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,680
 So it's like coffee creamer and then syrups and all kinds of stuff, so it kind of muddies

541
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
 it up.

542
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,640
 And as always, Canadian Scoop Crystal, dirty for Mormons, not dirty for you.

543
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 Exactly.

544
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
 That's right.

545
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,000
 And you're absolutely right, Scoop Amante Cristo, the blood does thicken on this stuff.

546
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
 It is an extreme blood thickener.

547
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 You know who hates that soda is your pancreas.

548
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
 That's who hates that.

549
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,160
 Oh, he hasn't had a lot to say around here in a long time.

550
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,400
 He really has had no voice in the conversation.

551
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,200
 He has been in the non-vocal minority for a while.

552
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,840
 Excluded from the conversation for a while.

553
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
 Pancre-who?

554
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
 Pancre-hoodis?

555
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,920
 Pancre-you, not Pancre-us.

556
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
 Pancre-hoodis?

557
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:55,560
 Yeah, here's Winter Scoop's recipe, 44-ounce Dr. Pepper with three creamers, also do it

558
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,320
 with root beer, makes the soda into the float drink after the ice cream is eaten up.

559
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
 Oh, man.

560
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
 I don't think it was that.

561
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
 Jesus.

562
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
 I don't think it was that much.

563
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
 That's real dirty.

564
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 It was a little.

565
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 It was a small cup of it.

566
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,560
 On the show we talked about, once I put French vanilla creamer into apple cider, because

567
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,680
 I did it on Thanksgiving, to be drinking apple pie.

568
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
 Oh, yeah.

569
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
 It would come off like a little ala mode.

570
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
 Yeah.

571
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
 How'd it go?

572
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
 So delicious.

573
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:29,520
 But again, my teeth rattle as I recall the story.

574
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,280
 I'm not watching a video of somebody make one of these.

575
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,600
 Then you're like pouring Diet Coke into a glass, pouring some kind of creamer into it

576
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,120
 on top of it, and then just squeezing a lime, and now they're pouring some raspberry-looking

577
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
 syrups into it.

578
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 There you go.

579
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
 Yep.

580
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
 Yeah.

581
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,440
 Yeah, there's lots of different recipes.

582
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,040
 It's alchemy, and I think it's fun that you can come up with all these crazy new things.

583
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:05,680
 Don't get me wrong, I did Mr. Pib Zero with cherry vanilla on the thing, on the soda thing.

584
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
 Oh, okay.

585
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,640
 That was legit good.

586
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
 I felt like a dirty Mormon at my movie.

587
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
 Yeah.

588
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,160
 Steven Eames asking, "Wouldn't the milk curdle it?"

589
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,400
 Well, there's no milk involved in these non-dairy creamers.

590
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
 They're just flavored liquids.

591
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,000
 According to the Googles, some people use dairy creamers, though, and so I would think

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 those would curdle.

593
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,320
 Those people are monsters.

594
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,140
 That sounds horrific.

595
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,840
 That doesn't sound any better or worse than anything else we're talking about.

596
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
 What?

597
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 What?

598
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
 Do you want a cottage cheese soda?

599
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 That's what that would be.

600
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,840
 That sounds as good as everything else you're describing.

601
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,280
 I'm fine with ... The dairy is not what's bothering me here.

602
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:06,840
 No, even when you go like AL8 and Big Red, when I travel, you find a novelty soda, and

603
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
 then you look at them.

604
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,520
 One of the reasons why they're thriving as a novelty soda is they have 50 more calories

605
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
 than Coke.

606
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
 Right.

607
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
 Oh, Jesus.

608
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,520
 People are just like, "Oh, this is just, that's significant, that's a significant amount of

609
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
 sugar."

610
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
 Yeah.

611
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 Right.

612
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,760
 A Thirsty Scoop had a cherry pie dirty soda, it was sprite, cream, cherry syrup, and vanilla.

613
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,400
 Typical dirty soda can contain significantly more calories than a regular soda, potentially

614
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,680
 ranging from 250 to 600 additional calories.

615
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
 For your beverage.

616
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
 Let's go.

617
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
 Yeah, that's your beverage.

618
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
 No, that's your meal.

619
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
 Now, let's be real.

620
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
 That's your meal.

621
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
 I hope so.

622
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,680
 I hope so too, but when I have just a bunch of sugar, it doesn't feel like a meal, so

623
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,040
 then I still am hungry.

624
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,920
 According to this thing that I found that doesn't mean anything at all, some large dirty

625
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,040
 sodas are right around 1,100 calories.

626
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
 There you go.

627
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,400
 You need to have a come to Jesus with your pancreas, Matt.

628
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
 Get them on the straight and narrow.

629
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,160
 My doctor already told me to have a come to Jesus moment with my pancreas, actually.

630
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,640
 I think he meant the other direction, though.

631
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,880
 My metformin prescription tells me I shouldn't be hitting up these dirty soda places, so

632
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
 maybe...

633
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,120
 Yeah, it's a rare treat kind of thing, the dirty soda, rare treat, it's a rare treat.

634
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,680
 What was the thing when you guys were doing the potato diet, what was the go-to thing

635
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,120
 with him to say you'd rarely feast on something?

636
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
 Rare and appropriate.

637
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
 Rare and appropriate.

638
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
 That was it.

639
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
 There's no appropriate.

641
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,960
 I was going to say, appropriate doesn't feel like the right word for dirty soda, no matter

642
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
 what.

643
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,960
 Rare and celebratory.

644
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
 That's it.

645
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
 Rare and horrible.

646
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
 Can't picture...

647
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
 Rare and annual.

648
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,500
 That old text thread with a, "Hey, rare and appropriate, while I'm eating a fucking gummy

649
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,720
 worm dipped in..."

650
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 Check it out, Ray.

651
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
 "Cherry cream."

652
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,000
 I bit the ends off of this gummy worm and now I'm using it as a straw.

653
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,120
 Yeah, dirty soda, latter day scoop says dirty sodas are frequent and excessive and that

654
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
 is absolutely right.

655
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,600
 It's okay though, because while I'm drinking this dirty soda, I'm a little chilly, so that's

656
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
 probably evening it all out.

657
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,000
 I'm outside and it's a bit nippy.

659
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,160
 Yeah, next time I sit down with my doctor, we go over some stuff, I'm going to be like,

660
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
 "That's so strange.

661
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,200
 I mean, other than my dirty sodas, I'm keeping it tip-top."

662
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,000
 I'm down to two dirty sodas a day.

663
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Oh, God.

664
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I can't...

665
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,520
 No, it was a small one and Anne had like, not even a third of it, she's like, "This

666
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
 is too sweet for me."

667
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
 Too much, too much.

668
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
 Was she bouncing off the walls?

669
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,280
 Was she a different gal all day?

670
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
 She was not.

671
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,320
 She was just like, "This is just too sweet for me."

672
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,240
 She, you know, she doesn't have the candy addiction like I do.

673
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
 She got them itchy teeth.

675
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,320
 And I was like, "I'm down.

676
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 Let me finish that soda."

677
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,120
 So I did and it was good.

678
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,520
 We were driving by, children in Las Vegas, I guess children in a lot of places, but...

679
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
 You say so.

680
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,440
 One of the kids, wise asses goes like, "Oh, can we stop by the dispensary on the way home?

681
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,480
 We just saw a dispensary."

682
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
 And I laughed and I said...

683
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,120
 Oh, they thought it was like a Soty Pops or something?

684
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,160
 Well, I said, I go, "What do you think a dispensary is?"

685
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
 Yeah.

686
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,360
 And he goes, "A place where you dispense of bodies?"

687
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,120
 And I was like, "Las Vegas, that seems like a fair guess.

688
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,120
 That seems like a fair..."

689
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
 Like one of those...

690
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
 They're worse guesses.

691
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,760
 Like one of those enzyme pools for horses, but we have one of those at the side of the

692
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
 road here.

693
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
 We just asked one of them.

694
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
 Oh, horse enzyme pools.

695
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
 Oh.

696
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,440
 You know what's in that Planet 13 building?

697
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,160
 A horse enzyme pool, that's what.

698
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,400
 It's so big because it's Olympic size.

699
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 It's an Olympic size horse enzyme pool.

700
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:13,240
 Talk about your fucking Artax, there you go.

701
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,560
 That's your sorrow swamp right there.

702
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,640
 So how did the kids like the dispensary?

703
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,000
 It helped them really enjoy Fantastic Four.

704
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,680
 I bet it enhanced their dirty sodas too.

705
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,520
 But having drunk that thing, I got to believe that that's going to be the next move for

706
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,240
 Starbucks, right?

707
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,680
 Like coffee houses got to start serving these things, right?

708
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,080
 Because they got all this stuff.

709
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,120
 But, Jacob, you make a face, but they got all this stuff except the soda.

710
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
 I understand.

711
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,320
 I mean, I don't think you're wrong from a business standpoint.

712
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,360
 I just don't want more of this stuff around.

713
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,760
 Well, oh, come on.

714
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:56,640
 I will also say, do you know, I tell you guys last year, it was like a year and a half ago...

715
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,120
 Dirty sodas don't really take off when they add ghee.

716
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
 Yeah.

717
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,840
 Oh, I'm so mad at you, thirsty scoop.

718
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,640
 Clarified butter soda.

719
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,680
 Oh, this is the angriest I have been in a scoop in a very long time.

720
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,000
 I'm having an Iron Man soda.

721
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,040
 You want to join me for an Iron Man soda?

722
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,760
 Oh, what's that?

723
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,760
 It's a ghee zero calorie soda chicken.

724
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
 Chicken?

725
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,040
 Just a piece of chicken.

726
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,920
 Just a piece of buffalo chicken.

727
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,280
 That's right.

728
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,400
 Bone-in buffalo chicken wing.

729
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
 Gummy celery stalk.

730
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
 Bone-in!

731
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:45,000
 A whole bone-in buffalo chicken wing, diet coke, diet coke, half a cup of ghee.

732
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Bullet dirty soda.

733
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Now with Mero.

734
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Bullet dirty soda.

735
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 You remember that bullet coffee?

736
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Bullet coffee.

737
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Yeah, you put the butter in it.

738
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Bullet proof coffee, put some ghee in it.

739
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 That's what I was referencing.

740
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 That's what I was referencing.

741
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,040
 And like, that's like, I'm going to bring that up to ...

742
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,520
 Oh, somebody's asking for a dirty soda bar at Scoop Fest.

743
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
 Yeah, keep asking.

744
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:14,440
 Well, we'll give you a dirty soda bar, but it's not going to be what you're thinking.

745
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,680
 It'd be more like the Double Down.

746
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,240
 And I was like, butter and coffee is gross.

747
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,680
 It was like, what's the difference between that and half and half, like from this fat

748
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
 content?

749
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
 Shit.

750
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,040
 And I was like, you got me again, cronus.

751
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,520
 Did he do butter and coffee regularly?

752
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
 Was that one of his go-tos?

753
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,520
 No, he thought it was stupid.

754
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,160
 He just also didn't do the cream or the coffee either.

755
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,360
 That's what he was calling it out.

756
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,680
 He was like, you're just sacrificing one collection of fat for another collection of fat, and

757
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,480
 both serve the same purpose, but just to make your black coffee feel more like a meal.

758
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,920
 And that's why everyone says this butter coffee makes me feel like I have energy, and I'm

759
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,400
 not crashing, and all this other stuff, and it's only because you turned it into a ...

760
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,760
 You put some fat in your system.

761
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,200
 You turned it into a calorie machine.

762
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 No.

763
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
 Anyhow.

764
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
 I've been called worse.

765
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,760
 I want to shout out to Jack Recider and Darknet Diaries.

766
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,240
 Oh yeah?

767
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,820
 The other morning, we're in the middle of talking, my wife gets a call, and she answers

768
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,160
 it because it's from a 2-1-2 number, and it's like Old Instincts from New York Actors.

769
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,720
 She always answered the 2-1-2 number, says it's the bank, and people are tripping fraud

770
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,120
 on her Zelle account.

771
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,680
 And so I'm listening to her.

772
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,160
 She's concerned, and my wife's very diligent.

773
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,360
 She gets out a pen and paper, so I was writing down information, started talking to the guy.

774
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 They transferred another phone, and she's going on and on with him for an amount of

775
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,600
 time that I start to feel weird.

776
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,760
 You thought she was having an affair?

777
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,840
 Yeah, I was like, if she's having an affair, let her have her time.

778
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,560
 I'll be over here with my ghee and my coffee.

779
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:03,400
 I'll be in my filming chair.

780
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,000
 And I'm listening to her go through certain activities, and she's starting to say answers

781
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,640
 that are weird to me.

782
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,000
 I just was like, what customer service thing would happen?

783
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,360
 I'm paranoid, and you know, when you're paranoid, you're like, I don't want to be the dumb idiot

784
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
 here.

785
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
 Right.

786
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,640
 I don't want to look paranoid.

787
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,200
 I don't want to look like I'm the weird paranoid guy, or be dramatic, or whatever my wife is

788
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,960
 handling a very serious matter.

789
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:41,720
 But I just find myself on my notes, just typing up, "Do you see fraud in your accounts, and

790
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,160
 do you trust the person you're on the phone with, or whatever?"

791
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
 Right.

792
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,000
 Now the person on the phone, they were doing an amazing job of an elaborate con.

793
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,640
 When people actually play chess instead of checkers, it is really hard.

794
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,440
 First the person said he was from Chase, but since this is a Zelle account, he's going

795
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,600
 to transfer them over to a Zelle operative, or whatever.

796
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 And the guy says-

797
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,040
 Oh, Latter Day Scoop in the chat just said something profound, which is, "With financial

798
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,940
 issues over the phone, you are either paranoid or naive."

799
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
 Yeah.

800
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,680
 And I think you're exactly right, Latter Day Scoop.

801
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,320
 I don't think you can just be right.

802
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
 And he was saying, "Don't tell me your account number.

803
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
 Don't give me any information.

804
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,720
 I don't want to know your birthday.

805
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,560
 We're just going to handle this as whatever."

806
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,680
 And that secondary misdirection of like, "Let's just do this or whatever."

807
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,760
 And then I'm listening to her, and so I put that note in front of her.

808
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,800
 She's already annoyed that she's trying to handle theft, right?

809
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,680
 And she puts it on hold, and she's kind of annoyed, and she gives me all the information

810
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
 that she has heard.

811
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,680
 And I said, "I know it's going to sound dramatic, but all the information you're telling me

812
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,120
 is coming from him.

813
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,140
 You have no other information from anyone else."

814
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:01,680
 The good move is always like, "Let me hang up on this call now, and I will call the number

815
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,320
 on the back of my card."

816
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
 That's a great move.

817
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,040
 Then you just know who you're talking to.

818
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,180
 Because if you Googled the number of the call from, it was her bank, but it was just a ...

819
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
 It was spoofed.

820
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
 It was a bank.

821
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
 Yeah.

822
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,080
 It was ... You can make numbers pop up the way you want them now with phone apps and

823
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
 stuff.

824
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
 Right.

825
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
 Yeah.

826
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
 Oh, yes.

827
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
 Is that the term?

828
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
 Spoofed.

829
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
 Spoofed.

830
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
 Yeah, yeah.

831
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
 You can just say it, Paul, but just explain it as a term to me.

832
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,720
 They call them dirty sodas.

833
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
 They spoof.

834
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:36,560
 Spoof in them.

835
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
 It's all the rage with the Mormons.

836
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,840
 Mormons love nothing more than a spoofed in diet coke.

837
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,160
 They had her typing ... She's like, "Just stay with me on the phone out loud.

838
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,520
 I'm asking questions too."

839
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,280
 Sounds like a spoof.

840
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,520
 They're offering to transfer back and forth to whatever they want to give the number.

841
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,720
 I was like, "Do you mind if I spoof while you talk?"

842
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,200
 "Spoof and soak," says Sarah Miller-Wall.

843
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,760
 I'm just here for a spoof and a soak.

844
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
 It is 2025.

845
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,080
 I can't stop you from spoofing in your own house.

846
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,960
 A spoof and a soak and a dirty diet coke.

847
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,380
 That's a Mormon Christmas right there.

848
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,040
 A spoof and a soak and a dirty diet coke.

849
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,440
 That's a Mormon Christmas.

850
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,480
 That's the song that plays when you're in line with the drive-thru lines down the line.

851
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,200
 You can hear that when you get within the border of SLC.

852
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,000
 Oh my goodness.

853
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 These guys were great actors.

854
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 We're like, "Listen.

855
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 See, it's a little shady."

856
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 The guy was like, "I can understand.

857
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 I'm going to give you my number.

858
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,640
 I'm going to give you this number, this number.

859
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,000
 I can transfer you back to your bank."

860
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,560
 I like how much credit you're giving the scammers on the phone here for doing a good job of

861
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
 a shitty thing.

862
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
 That's what I'm saying.

863
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
 I know.

864
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
 I like it.

865
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,240
 Normally, we get just a bullshit text that we can see in two seconds or a spam email.

866
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
 Yeah.

867
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
 Usually, just some bullshit nonsense.

868
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
 Something that we don't have.

869
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
 Whatever.

870
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,880
 This guy had some information to let Sarah know it was her deal.

871
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,560
 I said, "We can go to the bank and confirm that."

872
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,640
 He said, "Oh, absolutely you can.

873
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
 No problem.

874
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,680
 I can also transfer you back to your bank and you talk to the guy on the phone."

875
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,880
 I was like, "Oh, really clever."

876
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
 Yeah.

877
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
 That's good.

878
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,880
 I was like, "Yeah."

879
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,440
 But then he goes, "But he's just going to just get you back on the phone with us because

880
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,920
 this is about Zell and not about your bank."

881
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
 Yeah.

882
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,240
 If you're concerned about it, I can easily transfer you back over to the bank and then

883
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 you'll be comfortable with them, but honestly, it's just going to be a big waste of your

884
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
 time.

885
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
 Now, do you want me to do that?

886
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
 Do you want me to waste your time?

887
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
 Because I don't mind.

888
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 I don't want to waste your time all day.

889
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,880
 But if you're concerned, if you're just a little concerned little fella, I can transfer

890
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,080
 you back over to the bank.

891
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
 No problem."

892
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:08,440
 Then I was like ... So then we let him go on.

893
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,880
 So suddenly they're saying, "Your Zell is set to non-transactional, but we're just going

894
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,840
 to run this message through to confirm whatever."

895
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,360
 And that's when I was like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

896
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,760
 No, no, no, no, no."

897
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,440
 And that's when I was like, "Get off.

898
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
 We have to get off the phone."

899
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
 Yeah, we're done.

900
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,560
 We have to get off the phone.

901
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,920
 So we go to the phone and I was like, "Let's go to the bank."

902
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,800
 And I was like, "You don't have to come."

903
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,640
 I was like, "Sarah, someone's trying to shake us down for five grand.

904
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
 I'll happily come."

905
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
 Yeah.

906
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
 Let's go to the bank.

907
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
 "I'll come to the car.

908
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,760
 I'll come in the car and let's figure this out together."

909
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
 Yeah.

910
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
 Yeah.

911
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,960
 It was a total...credit to the great guys at the bank.

912
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,400
 We just were literally like, "Okay, let's just walk through it.

913
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
 Tell me everything.

914
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
 It sounds like a scam.

915
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,360
 I'm going to confirm this right now."

916
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
 And just so you know...

917
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
 Sounds like a what?

918
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
 Sounds like, "What happened there, Matt?"

919
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,880
 He said, "We're going to confirm that nothing has happened right now."

920
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,240
 Would you say this is a spoof?

921
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,200
 He just actually...he didn't say it was a spoof.

922
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,880
 He said, "This is..." and he winked and he took his Diet Coke underneath the table.

923
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,560
 Oh shit, that's the move.

924
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,960
 That's like the silent alarm.

925
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,640
 And he put it right in front of me.

926
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,880
 Then he put a second straw in the Diet Coke.

927
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
 A second straw!

928
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
 Shall we share?

929
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,520
 He said, "This is a race to the bottom."

930
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
 Spoiler!

931
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
 Matt won!

932
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:52,080
 I'll tell you who else can win a race to the bottom against anybody, anytime, anywhere.

933
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,800
 And that is the following sponsor.

934
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,220
 Today's show is brought to you by...if you guys want to do a fake commercial for Scoop's

935
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,680
 Plumbing and Heating, I'm okay with that.

936
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
 This is from 2021.

937
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
 Gas Man Scoop.

938
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,280
 Is he still...I don't even...is Scoop's Heating and Plumbing still in business?

939
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:16,680
 I think he's changed it up to...I think it's a Gas Man and Son kind of thing now, isn't

940
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,680
 it?

941
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
 I think so.

942
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
 I think you're right about the business anyway.

943
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
 Yeah.

944
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
 S-L-Y-D-A-T-F-O-W-I-T-F.

945
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,680
 Not as catchy as fuck you in the face.

946
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,440
 I don't know what that stands for though.

947
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,000
 Well, it's something about Scoop's Plumbing, I guess.

948
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 I don't know.

949
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 All right.

950
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
 Or maybe it was something that we would have gotten if we had read this a couple of years

951
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 ago.

952
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
 Probably.

953
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
 That's true.

954
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
 That's true.

955
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
 Could be.

956
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
 That's true.

957
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
 All right.

958
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
 Scoop's Plumbing and Heating.

959
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
 Right.

960
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
 It's time to get yourself some Scoop Plumbing and Heating, isn't it?

961
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
 Eh?

962
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
 Yeah.

963
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
 That's right.

964
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
 What?

965
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
 What?

966
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,400
 Are you too cold?

967
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
 What?

968
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
 You need some firewood, eh?

969
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
 What?

970
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
 Were you too hot?

971
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
 Eh?

972
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
 We'll bet some ice.

973
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
 That's what I got.

974
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,200
 Got a truck full of it.

975
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
 Eh?

976
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
 What?

977
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
 Eh?

978
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
 Eh?

979
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
 That would be good.

980
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
 Yeah.

981
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
 Right.

982
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
 All right.

983
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
 Let's go to Wood's Inn.

984
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
 Me and you.

985
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
 Come on.

986
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
 Come into my van.

987
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
 Let's go.

988
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
 And also, my drink is a little warm.

989
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
 Is there anything you can do for me about that?

990
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
 Hand it here.

991
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
 Oh, here you go.

992
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
 All right.

993
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
 Give me just a minute here.

994
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
 There you go.

995
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
 There.

996
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
 Spoofed now.

997
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
 Where?

998
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
 Where did you get that ice from?

999
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
 I spoofed it.

1000
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
 Spoofed it.

1001
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
 Wow.

1002
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,200
 You just spoofed out some ice.

1003
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
 That's what I do.

1004
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,600
 And you put it in my soda.

1005
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,200
 Fresh quality spoofed ice right for you.

1006
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,200
 Enjoy your scoop of spoof.

1007
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
 Just try this.

1008
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
 This is really good.

1009
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
 Damn right.

1010
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
 It's good.

1011
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:51,400
 A scoop of your scoop of your spoofin' helps the medicine go down, the medicine go down,

1012
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,840
 medicine go down.

1013
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
 That's right.

1014
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,200
 When it comes to your pipes, I'm not Mary fucking Poppins.

1015
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,200
 And her hay scoops the checkout.

1016
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
 The price is spoofed.

1017
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,880
 If you heard, Matt's probably seen them around town, but Paul, have you heard about these

1018
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,380
 electric cars that are the new driverless electric taxis going around Las Vegas?

1019
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,080
 I have seen some.

1020
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,520
 John and I, when my brother and I were in town, we actually saw some going around and

1021
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,000
 we were kind of amazed.

1022
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,840
 And I remember when I was doing promotional work for Opium back in the day, and I was

1023
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:41,920
 walking Fremont, they had them down at the end near Container Park, running practice

1024
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
 loops.

1025
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
 Yeah, they were doing practice loops.

1026
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,320
 And people could just volunteer and jump in the driverless taxi, which they're crazy looking

1027
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
 things.

1028
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
 They're mostly like open.

1029
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,560
 Yeah, they don't have a driver's seat at all.

1030
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,040
 They're not set up like a regular car.

1031
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,840
 They set up two bench seats facing each other and then the whole side of the automobile

1032
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,080
 just opens up as big sliding doors that open up and you just walk in and sit down in the

1033
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,680
 bench seats and it takes you to where you're going.

1034
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,440
 Winterscoop in the chat says Austin has these and says they're stupid and they cause a lot

1035
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
 of traffic.

1036
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,240
 They're not Waymo's, but they don't seem to cause a lot of traffic in Vegas.

1037
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,320
 They really seem pretty good.

1038
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,960
 I saw one pull up to a Dunkin' Donuts and it said, "I eat businesses" and it just chewed

1039
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
 right through.

1040
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,960
 Oh!

1041
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,360
 The car just ate right through the business.

1042
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
 That is tragic.

1043
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 I eat businesses!

1044
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
 Yeah.

1045
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,880
 It was like the Galactus of Dunkin' Donuts.

1046
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,200
 Galactus, the automatic car.

1047
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,200
 The world eater.

1048
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,880
 But I saw one driving the other day, I was driving next to one the other day and it didn't

1049
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
 have anyone in it.

1050
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,400
 And so it was just an empty vehicle driving down the road with no one in it.

1051
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,120
 They must have sent it on test runs just for advertising purposes, right?

1052
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,480
 I think it was going to pick someone up based on where I was because I was on one of the

1053
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,240
 back roads in town.

1054
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,520
 So I think it was just going like an Uber to go pick somebody up.

1055
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,600
 Are they affordable?

1056
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,980
 I think they're a little more expensive than a regular Uber, but I think they're made to

1057
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,000
 be pretty affordable, yeah.

1058
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,880
 On the one hand, I don't want to see a crazy amount of jobs go away.

1059
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,280
 I know specifically there are women who've had a very tough time with specific Uber drivers

1060
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,960
 and they all have a terrible one storey or two to share.

1061
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:49,080
 And so the idea of a robot probably is very comforting from that perspective.

1062
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,360
 I don't think they're going to go rogue, form a Voltron and destroy the city.

1063
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,320
 Do you want to see my gear shift?

1064
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
 Work my clutch?

1065
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,320
 That's the mode.

1066
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,800
 Can you please make sure it sexually harasses me when it picks me up?

1067
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,560
 Can I spoof you?

1068
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,840
 Can I spoof?

1069
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,520
 I want to spoof, baby spoof.

1070
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,760
 I'm here to spoof your drink.

1071
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,360
 Oh, God.

1072
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:25,460
 So it was weird seeing it just straight up next to me driving along 50 miles an hour

1073
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,320
 and just no one in the vehicle at all.

1074
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
 They're just in the lane.

1075
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
 It's a ghost car.

1076
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,360
 It's a ghost car, you see?

1077
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,800
 Yeah, because they're wide open windows and shit, so you can just see right inside all

1078
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,000
 of it and it is really weird.

1079
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Yeah.

1080
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 It was a little freaky.

1081
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Kind of looks like a fish tank.

1082
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,880
 I do kind of like it though.

1083
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,840
 It does look a little like a fish tank.

1084
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,120
 I like the idea of it though, especially for cities like this, especially for like the

1085
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,560
 strip area and everything.

1086
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,080
 It makes a lot of sense.

1087
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,080
 I think so too.

1088
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,600
 I'll be curious how, I mean, it's going to happen in some way or another.

1089
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,600
 You know?

1090
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
 Yeah.

1091
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,160
 It's going to catch on, you know, whether it's this year or in five years, it's going

1092
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
 to be...

1093
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,160
 I sure hope it does.

1094
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,760
 Until then, I'm so lonely.

1095
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
 Jacob.

1096
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,080
 Have you been a robot the whole time?

1097
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,520
 I've been a robot car this entire time.

1098
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,200
 I've been spoofed by Jacob this whole time.

1099
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,800
 I've been getting spoof all over your show the whole time.

1100
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,800
 Oh no.

1101
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,800
 So caloric.

1102
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,400
 I'm roughly 1,100 calories per sip.

1103
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,920
 Oh, I'll take the roughest 1,100 calories you can give me, please.

1104
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,720
 I'll loosen your teeth right up.

1105
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
 Yum.

1106
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,720
 There it is.

1107
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
 Scoop of Monte Cristo has got a picture in the chat.

1108
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
 Oh yeah, that's Scoop of Monte Cristo in the chat.

1109
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
 Yeah, that's them.

1110
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
 That's exactly it.

1111
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
 Yeah.

1112
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
 What company is that?

1113
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
 Can somebody tell me what company that is?

1114
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
 I think it's Google.

1115
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,340
 Oh.

1116
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,340
 It might be.

1117
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,340
 I think it's Google.

1118
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,340
 Zooks.

1119
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,340
 Zooks.

1120
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,340
 Z-O-O-X.

1121
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,340
 Gadzooks.

1122
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,000
 Oh, owned by Amazon.

1123
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,280
 Oh, so just a different monolithic corporation, Matt.

1124
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,000
 You were right about the monolithic corporation.

1125
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 Just wrong one.

1126
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 Ah, got me a good Amazon.

1127
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,920
 Beer Nun is saying we should put my cinema seat head as the driver.

1128
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,440
 I was talking about that before.

1129
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,440
 Oh yeah.

1130
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,320
 I mean, that would be a serious feature.

1131
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,560
 You'd have to pay extra for a solo ride.

1132
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,200
 That's definitely happening, by the way, in Vegas.

1133
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,560
 Oh, people are getting their bone on in those carts.

1134
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,560
 That's definitely going to happen.

1135
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,920
 I mean, I'm calling it.

1136
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
 I'm saying it's going to be...

1137
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
 Oh, sure.

1138
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
 Yes.

1139
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
 They're all recorded, though, right?

1140
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,320
 They clearly got cameras going.

1141
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,880
 Feature not a bug.

1142
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
 Feature not a bug.

1143
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,120
 I mean, I guess if it's consensual, then who cares, right?

1144
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,120
 Oh, someone's going to care.

1145
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,120
 Yeah.

1146
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,120
 Someone's going to care.

1147
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
 Yeah.

1148
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,120
 Yeah.

1149
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,120
 Scully's like, "It's going to happen?

1150
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
 Yeah."

1151
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:46,720
 "It's taking me a second to type that search in.

1152
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,200
 Has anyone been arrested for sex in a driverless taxi?"

1153
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,200
 Okay.

1154
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,040
 "While reports indicate some people are engaging in sexual activity in driverless taxis, there

1155
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,200
 haven't been arrests specifically for this activity in those vehicles yet."

1156
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,800
 Mostly just applause and showers of money.

1157
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,600
 That's it.

1158
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,080
 Mostly just people screaming, "Oddcore!

1159
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
 Oddcore!"

1160
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,080
 Get it!

1161
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,760
 You filth nugget!

1162
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,280
 Get it!

1163
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,200
 All these people dogging in robo-taxis.

1164
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,760
 Galactic President says, "Challenge accepted."

1165
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
 Someone has to do it.

1166
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
 Yeah.

1167
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,760
 Oh.

1168
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,520
 No, baby, this thing on my phone's a signal jammer.

1169
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
 You can't record in here.

1170
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,520
 Yeah!

1171
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,520
 No, no problem.

1172
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1173
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,320
 It's a basic, was it a Fermi cage, what that thing called?

1174
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,320
 That's a Fermi cage.

1175
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
 What's it called?

1176
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,320
 No, it's a Fermi cage.

1177
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
 You got it.

1178
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
 It's not a Fermi cage.

1179
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,320
 A Fermi cage.

1180
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
 Don't worry, baby.

1181
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,120
 I got this digital cloaking app.

1182
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,680
 Baby, I'm going to use this Fermi cage.

1183
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
 You won't get pregnant.

1184
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
 It's fine.

1185
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,680
 Faraday.

1186
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
 Faraday is what people are screaming.

1187
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,680
 Faraday cage.

1188
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,680
 That's it.

1189
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
 No, Fermi.

1190
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,680
 No, it's a Fermi cage.

1191
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,680
 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

1192
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,680
 My Fermi cage slipped off.

1193
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,680
 You got to ...

1194
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,200
 You got to go see the doctor.

1195
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,880
 It's Fermi Paradox, Faraday cage.

1196
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,320
 You got to get a Plan B. My Fermi cage slipped off.

1197
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,440
 A Fermi cage.

1198
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
 What would a Fermi cage be?

1199
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:22,520
 The Fermi paradox is the reason why we won't encounter extraterrestrials or an argument

1200
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
 as to why.

1201
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,840
 What about a Furby cage?

1202
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,480
 Oh, a Furby cage.

1203
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,480
 Boy, that's ...

1204
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480
 Oh, I had one of those in the '90s.

1205
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
 It was great.

1206
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
 Let's go.

1207
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,000
 Faraday Paradox.

1208
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,680
 On Twitch, DoubleOGroovy says Faraday cake.

1209
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,360
 Been sucking all these cocks, driving around in the Faraday Paradox.

1210
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,040
 Oh my God.

1211
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
 Go on, Matt.

1212
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,040
 What's the second line?

1213
00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:01,440
 Pulled to the robot, "Robot's in my driveway."

1214
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,440
 Fool.

1215
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,560
 Yeah, no, that's coming.

1216
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,520
 Somebody's going to really get busy in one of those.

1217
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,160
 I think that's going to be the first issue that'll be popping up in the press.

1218
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,080
 It won't be the elimination of jobs.

1219
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,560
 It'll be like, "Too many people fucking in those things on Saturday nights."

1220
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,520
 Right.

1221
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,520
 But it won't stop it.

1222
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,520
 No.

1223
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
 Nothing can stop it.

1224
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
 Nothing can stop it.

1225
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,840
 Yeah, I'm not seeing any big reports about people having sex in them yet.

1226
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
 Okay.

1227
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,400
 But yeah, I think we can fix that.

1228
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,960
 It's a pioneering activity.

1229
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,400
 We can really get all the credit.

1230
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,440
 There's going to be some exploration.

1231
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
 Yeah.

1232
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,120
 It's going to be great.

1233
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,120
 Let's see.

1234
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,880
 You guys want to do a little Scoop Mail?

1235
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880
 Yes.

1236
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,720
 I've got a surprise for you.

1237
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,720
 Oh shit.

1238
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,720
 Physical Scoop Mail.

1239
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,720
 Physical Scoop Mail.

1240
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,720
 Zippity doo.

1241
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
 We've got mail in a box.

1242
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,720
 I love it.

1243
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,720
 That's right.

1244
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,720
 Message for you, sir.

1245
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:03,640
 We've got a Scoop Mail from Yarn and Sticks.

1246
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
 Yay.

1247
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,160
 Hello, you sexy face fuckers.

1248
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,080
 I'm not going to read this whole note right now just because we're not all together.

1249
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,840
 But basically Yarn and Sticks has sent us some decorations for the new churn.

1250
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,880
 Oh cool.

1251
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,680
 And they are fantastic.

1252
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,680
 They are all knit.

1253
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,680
 Oh, hold on.

1254
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,400
 I'll turn my screen thing off so you can see on the screen.

1255
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:35,360
 But they are all like knit ice cream cock and balls.

1256
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:42,200
 And my question is, what else do you want?

1257
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,200
 That's amazing.

1258
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,640
 Those look great.

1259
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,640
 That's amazing.

1260
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,640
 How adorable.

1261
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,040
 And that's just one of them.

1262
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,040
 How do you find this?

1263
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,520
 How do you find this stitching pattern for that?

1264
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,520
 Wow.

1265
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,520
 That looks great.

1266
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,520
 That's just a straight up wiener.

1267
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
 I love it.

1268
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,520
 Yeah.

1269
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,040
 There's one more down here too.

1270
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,320
 But thank you, Yarn and Sticks.

1271
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,640
 Yeah, Yarn and Sticks.

1272
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,640
 That's freaking awesome.

1273
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,320
 Do you have an Etsy shop or something we can promote?

1274
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,880
 Oh, that'd be nice.

1275
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,040
 Yeah, those will go up in the new churn.

1276
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,840
 This actually helps me.

1277
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:18,480
 I've been wondering, just to myself, just if we should, for the new churn, actually decorate

1278
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,920
 it or I'm going to turn this music off, I've been wondering to myself if we should decorate

1279
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,720
 the new churn when we move into the new churn or if we should do full green screen all the

1280
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,080
 way around it so that we can just change the decorations anytime we want.

1281
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,240
 Oh, that's not a bad idea.

1282
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,560
 The knit ice cream cock and balls makes me want to have them in the new churn.

1283
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1284
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,160
 I think we should definitely have some green screen posters around.

1285
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,800
 Yeah, maybe we can do something.

1286
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
 Yeah.

1287
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
 So you can just pop up some stuff.

1288
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:54,880
 At this point, I think you just want LED screens, so basically TVs.

1289
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,880
 Oh.

1290
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,160
 We can do that too.

1291
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,080
 I was thinking that it might be a little, I was thinking, my thought was it would be,

1292
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,280
 here, we'll just do that.

1293
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,920
 Oh my gosh.

1294
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:13,120
 Production meeting, when we talk about how the sausage gets baked.

1295
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,200
 So my thought was, we just have a green screen wrapped around behind us all the time, and

1296
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,760
 we're just always somewhere different, and it could just be a ridiculous thing, just

1297
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,440
 a ridiculous bit going on, like a visual bit going on.

1298
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,360
 If you wanted us in green screen, then anyone could put us anywhere.

1299
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,720
 That's what I thought you were going with it.

1300
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
 I like your bit.

1301
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
 Oh, we could do that too.

1302
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,720
 Yeah.

1303
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
 I like your bit, Jacob.

1304
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,720
 I like the idea.

1305
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,520
 I would suggest doing it with like a fake window, like maybe even cut out.

1306
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
 That's not a bad idea.

1307
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
 A little square thing.

1308
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
 Yeah, we could do that.

1309
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,520
 Yeah.

1310
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,680
 And make it like a fake window, and then we can just put weird stuff going on outside

1311
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,680
 the window.

1312
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
 Scoop of Monte Cristo.

1313
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,720
 It's just always going to be the Geekshock house.

1314
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,720
 That would be pretty funny.

1315
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,480
 That would be pretty funny indeed.

1316
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,480
 Yeah.

1317
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,480
 That would be fun.

1318
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,480
 Yeah.

1319
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,080
 But these are so great, and yeah, there's yarn and sticks sent to home.

1320
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,320
 A screen for bucket picks again.

1321
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:17,300
 Should we do that for the show this time, Matt, speaking of we're still in production

1322
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,880
 meeting mode?

1323
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,000
 For the Wednesday bucket show?

1324
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 Yeah.

1325
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,600
 Should we try a bucket picks thing, or maybe even just for the second show?

1326
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,040
 We have found it increasingly difficult to broadcast from that theater.

1327
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,040
 Right.

1328
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
 Yeah.

1329
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,040
 Yeah.

1330
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,040
 That's the problem.

1331
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,040
 There's no Wi-Fi there.

1332
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
 We can think about something.

1333
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,720
 Maybe we can do like a local bucket picks or something.

1334
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,360
 Maybe we can do something.

1335
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,560
 We might figure something out.

1336
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,560
 Okay.

1337
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,560
 That'd be fun.

1338
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,560
 Yeah.

1339
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,560
 Let's do a little...

1340
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,680
 We are confirmed for the bucket show the Wednesday before seven and nine o'clock.

1341
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,680
 Two different shows.

1342
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,680
 Fantastic.

1343
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,280
 At the Majestic Rep Theater.

1344
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,600
 I'm fucking pumped, baby.

1345
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,440
 That of course is the Wednesday leading up to ScoopFest at the end of September here.

1346
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,200
 Come join us in Las Vegas for ScoopFest, scoopfest.com.

1347
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,960
 Head on over there right now.

1348
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,960
 That reminds me, I have to reply to an email regarding ScoopFest that I completely forgot

1349
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,200
 about until just now that I shouldn't reply to right now because we're in the middle of

1350
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
 a show.

1351
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200
 Here's Jack versus Nerd.

1352
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
 Good narrating, Jacob.

1353
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,200
 That was very nice.

1354
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,200
 Very good.

1355
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
 Very good.

1356
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
 I was also looking for the right button.

1357
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
 Jack versus Nerd action.

1358
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
 Oh, am I?

1359
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
 Fuck, yeah.

1360
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

1361
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
 Cock and balls.

1362
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
 Cock and balls.

1363
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,200
 Cock and balls.

1364
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
 Cock and balls.

1365
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
 Cock and balls.

1366
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
 Cock and balls.

1367
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
 Cock and balls.

1368
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,200
 Nice green cock.

1369
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,200
 Cock and balls.

1370
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,200
 Cock and balls.

1371
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
 Cock and balls.

1372
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,200
 Explosion of spoof.

1373
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,880
 We got a Scooperty coming at us today from Smart Scoop.

1374
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,560
 It is the first time Smart Scoop has written us a Scooperty, so thank you very much, Smart

1375
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
 Scoop.

1376
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,240
 If you want to send us a Scooperty or a Price is Scryte Jack versus Nerd or an Obelisk Jack

1377
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,160
 versus Nerd, heyscoops.com is where you can go, heyscoops.com.

1378
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,000
 Make us a Scooperty, just like the one we're about to play right now.

1379
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,840
 The categories are dead weights, or dead weight, video conferencing, educational TV, and famous

1380
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
 departures.

1381
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,320
 Matt, you're up first.

1382
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,600
 I want educational TV, please.

1383
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:14,120
 In the '90s, this former engineer from Boeing added the Science Guy to his name and attempted

1384
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,320
 to educate America.

1385
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
 Bill Cosby.

1386
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,000
 Bill Cosby, the Science Guy.

1387
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 Bill...

1388
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 But you know, it turns out that if you add water to a simple piece of frozen nitrogen,

1389
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,480
 it'll foam up like that, is what it does, and also you can roofie the ladies' sides.

1390
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,200
 Thank you, Bill.

1391
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
 That was correct, Matt.

1392
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
 Bill Cosby.

1393
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,200
 The spoof, the spoof was on fire.

1394
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,200
 Oh, no.

1395
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,880
 The spoof was on fire.

1396
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,080
 We do need some water.

1397
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,200
 Don't let it burn.

1398
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,440
 I'll try Famous Departures for $400.

1399
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,120
 After an incident with a writer, this actor was fired from Criminal Minds.

1400
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,240
 I have no idea.

1401
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,240
 I will pass.

1402
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
 Paul.

1403
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,240
 What's the category?

1404
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,240
 Departures.

1405
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,080
 Oh, man.

1406
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,440
 I don't ever watch Criminal Minds.

1407
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,440
 I have to pass.

1408
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
 I don't think I've ever seen it.

1409
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
 Matt.

1410
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,040
 Eric Danson, Ted Danson's cousin.

1411
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,040
 Eric Danson.

1412
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,760
 I have no idea.

1413
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,480
 The Lesser Danson.

1414
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,480
 Thomas Gibson.

1415
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
 Thomas Gibson.

1416
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,480
 Thomas Gibson.

1417
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,080
 Eric Danson changed his name to Thomas Gibson.

1418
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,080
 Hold me closer.

1419
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,080
 Eric Danson.

1420
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,160
 It was because of the sag issue.

1421
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
 Paul.

1422
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,520
 I'll try video conferencing.

1423
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,920
 Bought by Microsoft in 2011 and Sunset in 2025, this video conferencing software was

1424
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,280
 superseded by Teams.

1425
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
 Hangout.

1426
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,200
 Oh, hangout or hang out is incorrect.

1427
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
 It's Skype.

1428
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,200
 Ask my fart.

1429
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,200
 Poop my turd.

1430
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,200
 We just got demonetized.

1431
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
 Matt.

1432
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,200
 Educational TV for $800 please.

1433
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,200
 Daily Double.

1434
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,200
 All of it.

1435
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:08,200
 I will eat all of the Dunkin Donuts shop.

1436
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:16,320
 This television series created and hosted originally by Carl Sagan and later revised

1437
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,760
 by Neil deGrasse Tyson, attempted to educate America about the universe.

1438
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,760
 Oh, shit.

1439
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,000
 I don't remember the name of this.

1440
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Let's see.

1441
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 It's Daily Double.

1442
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 Daily Double.

1443
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 It's your Daily Double?

1444
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 Oh, man.

1445
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Let's see.

1446
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 You remember that?

1447
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 I can give you a hint.

1448
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,400
 Secrets of the Space and Time.

1449
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,920
 I can give you a good hint.

1450
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,480
 Give me a good hint, Paul.

1451
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,440
 Kramer.

1452
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:53,960
 Non-Dairy Kramer or Regular Dairy Kramer?

1453
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,960
 Nope.

1454
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,960
 Regular Dairy Kramer.

1455
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,960
 Seinfeld Kramer.

1456
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,560
 Michael, what was his name?

1457
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,560
 I don't care.

1458
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,760
 What was his name?

1459
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:10,240
 I know that's the hint you're giving me, but I know that I'm experiencing cosmic dissonance

1460
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,040
 without clouds over my brain right now, so I know I'm not going to charge this.

1461
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,040
 Wait, cause of what?

1462
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,040
 Yeah, what did you say?

1463
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,040
 That was close, buddy.

1464
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,720
 Cause of what, dissonance?

1465
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,720
 Cosmic dissonance?

1466
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,880
 Well, cosmic?

1467
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,120
 So what was his name?

1468
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,160
 Oh, Cosmos.

1469
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,160
 Cosmos?

1470
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,160
 Cosmos!

1471
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,160
 Hey!

1472
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,120
 No problem at all.

1473
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,240
 Just a couple of very easy, no problem hints given to math there.

1474
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,880
 His name is Cosmo Kramer is his real name.

1475
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,880
 Oh, God.

1476
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
 I started to think of his real name.

1477
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,000
 Yeah, you're trying to think of Michael Richards.

1478
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 Michael Richards.

1479
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,440
 Kramer's real name is Cosmos.

1480
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
 Cosmo.

1481
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
 Yeah.

1482
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,440
 It's me.

1483
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,680
 Let's keep dragging this out more.

1484
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
 Let's keep talking.

1485
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,680
 Yeah, yeah.

1486
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
 I don't think people understand what was happening.

1487
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,800
 Remember how Kramer's name was Cosmo?

1488
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,800
 Amazing.

1489
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,800
 Speaking of Cosmo.

1490
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,800
 Remember that painting they did of him?

1491
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,800
 How silly.

1492
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:04,800
 In shipping and aviation, what is the term for dead weight added to maintain equilibrium?

1493
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,800
 Paul Mattingly.

1494
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,800
 Your mom.

1495
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,800
 Your mom.

1496
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:14,200
 What's weird is now like Michael Richards would just be able to tour after what he did

1497
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,200
 had happened to him.

1498
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
 Oh, yeah.

1499
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,960
 He'd now just be able to play specific comedy clubs where the audiences would cheer him

1500
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
 as a hero.

1501
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,960
 Right.

1502
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,960
 Oh, yeah.

1503
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,960
 So gross.

1504
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,960
 He could open for Gutfeld.

1505
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,800
 In addition to ship and get aviation, oh, right, ballast.

1506
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
 That's ballast.

1507
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
 Yep.

1508
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
 Ballast.

1509
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,280
 There's like a mine that works in an aquarium and he does this bit where if he sees a woman

1510
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,800
 carrying a book bag and the guy doing nothing, he stops them and makes the guy wear the book

1511
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,200
 bag or makes the guy push the stroller.

1512
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,680
 Have you seen this before?

1513
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
 I have.

1514
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,040
 I think it's SeaWorld.

1515
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,320
 And I said, "No one show this to Trump, he'll bam mimes."

1516
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,760
 All right, where are we?

1517
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,760
 Paul.

1518
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,760
 I'll try educational TV.

1519
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,160
 For $1,200.

1520
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,200
 This British comedy quiz show hosted by Stephen Fry and Sandy Toksvig.

1521
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:11,820
 Toksvig, I never know how to say Sandy, I don't know how to say that name, at different times,

1522
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,920
 is an abbreviation and favors interesting and obscure facts over the traditional format.

1523
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,920
 IQ.

1524
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,400
 IQ is correct, almost correct.

1525
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
 QI.

1526
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
 Oh, it's QI.

1527
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
 Fart on me.

1528
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,240
 Quite interesting.

1529
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,600
 Fart on Paul, indeed.

1530
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,080
 Boy, I'm getting lambasted here.

1531
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,080
 Matt.

1532
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,440
 You should get clues like I do, Paul, it really helps.

1533
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,920
 Matt, the answer is Cosmos.

1534
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,440
 I don't think anybody else knew this one.

1535
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,440
 I didn't.

1536
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,600
 I knew that Penn hosted an American pilot of it, but I forgot the name of it.

1537
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,600
 Oh, really?

1538
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,600
 Wow.

1539
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,600
 Yeah.

1540
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,600
 It's a funny show.

1541
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
 I've seen it a few times.

1542
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,600
 I don't remember the name of it.

1543
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,120
 Since I'm killing on educational TV, let's go for it.

1544
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,240
 All right, $2,000.

1545
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,560
 Hosted by Jonathan Ross, Allison Hannigan, and Brooke Burke successfully, this television

1546
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,360
 program taught me that there are only four magic tricks.

1547
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,800
 The rest is just stagecraft.

1548
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,960
 That would also be QI.

1549
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,960
 QI is correct.

1550
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,440
 It would be Fool Us.

1551
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,160
 Fool Us, of course, on the ... I forgot what channel that's on.

1552
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,160
 CW.

1553
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,160
 It's easy to forget.

1554
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,160
 CW.

1555
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,160
 Yeah.

1556
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,200
 In my show, I say it's the highest rated show on CW, which is like having the best

1557
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,600
 Italian restaurant in Alabama.

1558
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,600
 It's not nothing.

1559
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
 It's me.

1560
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,600
 I'll try.

1561
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
 Let's try Famous Departures again.

1562
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,600
 The first one went so well.

1563
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
 Successful stints on The Daily Show in The Office made this actor an A-lister.

1564
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,600
 He left The Office in 2011 at the conclusion of the seventh season.

1565
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,600
 This is the second question, the one about the show that none of us have seen was the

1566
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,600
 first question.

1567
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,600
 To be fair, Criminal Minds is probably a higher rated show.

1568
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,600
 Steve Carell is the second?

1569
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,600
 Yeah.

1570
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,600
 Oh, that's probably true.

1571
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,600
 Steve Carell, anyway.

1572
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,600
 Yeah.

1573
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,600
 Yeah.

1574
01:05:46,600 --> 01:06:01,760
 I'll try Dead Weight.

1575
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:14,640
 I know it's going to be the answer somewhere here.

1576
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,240
 What is the name of the exercise in which bodybuilders lift large amounts of weight

1577
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,480
 straight off the floor and hold it for several seconds?

1578
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,880
 A deadlift.

1579
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,680
 A deadlift is correct.

1580
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,680
 Dead Laszlo.

1581
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,680
 Dead Laszlo.

1582
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,680
 Matt.

1583
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,680
 Score check real quick.

1584
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,680
 Matt's in the lead with 3,200.

1585
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
 I'm in second with 1,200.

1586
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,680
 Paul is in third with negative 800.

1587
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,680
 He's had a couple of rough stints.

1588
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,960
 We're about halfway through the game and there's still one daily double left.

1589
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,960
 Matt Donnelly.

1590
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,960
 Wow.

1591
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,960
 Good recap.

1592
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,960
 Matt Donnelly for 2,800.

1593
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
 Not available.

1594
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:52,500
 I will take video conferencing for 800.

1595
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:57,140
 This video conferencing software rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues

1596
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,480
 to be the most commonly used conference tool today.

1597
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,000
 That would be Zoox, the car, automated car.

1598
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
 Yeah.

1599
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,800
 It takes you to all of your conferences.

1600
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
 Zoox.

1601
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
 Gad Zoox.

1602
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,800
 Zoom.

1603
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,800
 Zoom.

1604
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,800
 Gad Zoom.

1605
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,800
 We're on it right now.

1606
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
 We are.

1607
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,320
 And all of our Patreons are on it with us.

1608
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,320
 That's right.

1609
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,320
 It's pretty popular.

1610
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,320
 It's me.

1611
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,320
 I'll try Dead Weight for 1,200.

1612
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,320
 Daily double.

1613
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,000
 Still for 1,200.

1614
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,740
 The Rolling Stones have a popular song about a beast of this, a well-known synonym for

1615
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,740
 dead weight.

1616
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,000
 Oh, you've got this.

1617
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,520
 A beast of Mattingly.

1618
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
 Hold on.

1619
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,520
 Pause.

1620
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
 Pause.

1621
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,520
 Pause.

1622
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,520
 Wait a minute.

1623
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,520
 Beast of Mattingly.

1624
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,520
 Of course it is.

1625
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,520
 Beast of spoofing.

1626
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,520
 Beast of spoofing.

1627
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
 That's thirsty.

1628
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
 That's a good one.

1629
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,520
 Of course it's the beast of burden.

1630
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
 Yes.

1631
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,520
 Blue.

1632
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,520
 Paul.

1633
01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:00,320
 I will go with, I'll finish out Dead Weight, please.

1634
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,320
 All right.

1635
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:08,480
 One half of Matt and Mattingly, this comedian and magician has been carried by Paul Mattingly

1636
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,360
 for so long that Paul's back hurts.

1637
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,200
 This is different than I thought it was going to go.

1638
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,200
 Matt Donnelly.

1639
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,200
 It's a twist.

1640
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,200
 It's a twist.

1641
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,200
 It's a twist.

1642
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,320
 Matt the Mind Noodler Donnelly, of course.

1643
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,320
 Holy smokes.

1644
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,320
 You're not wrong.

1645
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,320
 He's not wrong.

1646
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,640
 It could have gone one way or the other.

1647
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,640
 Right.

1648
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,920
 Matt, you have videoconferencing or famous departures?

1649
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,440
 I'll go with videoconferencing, please, for 1,200.

1650
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,640
 In 2007, Cisco Systems acquired this videoconferencing technology widely used by enterprises prior

1651
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,160
 to widespread adoption of both Zoom and Teams.

1652
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
 Hmm.

1653
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
 Pass.

1654
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,160
 Huh.

1655
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,260
 All right, pass it to me.

1656
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:58,360
 I think Cisco was the company that bought TikTok, but that wouldn't be, that's not 2007.

1657
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,360
 That's too early for that.

1658
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:06,360
 Oh, I was about to say it was this Teams, but no Teams is in the thing.

1659
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,360
 I have no idea.

1660
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,360
 Pass.

1661
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,360
 Paul.

1662
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,900
 Maybe Slack, but I'm going to pass.

1663
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,900
 Let's try it.

1664
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,900
 Webex.

1665
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,080
 God, I'm so glad I didn't pass on that one.

1666
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,080
 Webex.

1667
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,080
 Webex.

1668
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
 That sounds like spoofing.

1669
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,080
 Spoofed.

1670
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,040
 That's what you're left with after you spoof, you get that little bit of web.

1671
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,040
 Yeah.

1672
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,040
 Webex.

1673
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,040
 I'm closing out videoconferencing for 2,000.

1674
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,720
 My dirty soda's down to the Webex.

1675
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,720
 You can throw it out.

1676
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,720
 Upsetting.

1677
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:41,280
 For as little as $2 a month, this audience member can get a podcast exclusively for them

1678
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,960
 over Zoom.

1679
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,000
 It's $3 a month now, but it's Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.

1680
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:55,440
 Oh, this audience, oh, I was supposed to say the audience member is Scoop, not the podcast

1681
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,440
 name.

1682
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,440
 Oh.

1683
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,440
 Fine.

1684
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,440
 Paul.

1685
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,360
 I'll try the famous departures for 1,200 or 2,000.

1686
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,360
 I'll try the 2,000.

1687
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,360
 I don't know.

1688
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,360
 I still can't win.

1689
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,360
 Try it out.

1690
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,720
 After sticking it out for over 1,200 episodes, this Scoop has decided to leave the community

1691
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,880
 after it became apparent that the show is not for him any longer, but for the Scoops

1692
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,840
 who pay for access.

1693
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,920
 Oh no.

1694
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,920
 What?

1695
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,660
 I don't know.

1696
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:27,120
 I have news for that Scoop.

1697
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,940
 I often put out the Zoomlings for all members, so actually you can get it for free.

1698
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:37,160
 We just are asking generally for $3 in support.

1699
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,160
 That's it.

1700
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,520
 But if you actually go to our Patreon to become a free member, you'll still get the majority

1701
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,380
 of the Zoomlings.

1702
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,380
 There you go.

1703
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,480
 We're not much of a paywall.

1704
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,800
 Way to fucking stick it to us as I've been actually giving it to you for free the entire

1705
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
 time.

1706
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,760
 I think this has got to be a tongue-in-cheek thing, right?

1707
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,760
 Maybe it's a joke answer.

1708
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,760
 I don't think so.

1709
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,760
 Let's see.

1710
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,760
 We're going to find out in a second.

1711
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,760
 Paul, do you have an answer?

1712
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,760
 I don't have a guess.

1713
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,120
 Let's see what it is.

1714
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
 Smart Scoop.

1715
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
 Smart Scoop.

1716
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,880
 So apparently it's not a fun answer.

1717
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,480
 It's just Smart Scoop leaving, I guess.

1718
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,480
 No.

1719
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,120
 He wouldn't send in a thing and then be like, "It's for you."

1720
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,840
 That's why I'm confused.

1721
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,840
 No.

1722
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,680
 You've landed on why I'm confused.

1723
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,520
 Matt, will they, won't they?

1724
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,920
 One of the most famous examples is Sam Malone and Diane Chambers from Cheers.

1725
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,320
 Turns out, won't they?

1726
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,520
 As this actress left the show after the fifth season.

1727
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
 Right.

1728
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,160
 Smart Scoop.

1729
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,720
 Smart Scoop is also the answer.

1730
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
 Yeah.

1731
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,720
 Shelly Long.

1732
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,880
 Shelly Long.

1733
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,320
 Of course it's Shelly Long.

1734
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,320
 Good old Shelly Long.

1735
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,320
 She the best.

1736
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,600
 And that is the game.

1737
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,680
 I'm sure glad it didn't get awkward at the end.

1738
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:52,280
 Matt wins with 5,200, Paul is in second with 1,200, I'm in third with 400.

1739
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,400
 And that came to us from Smart Scoop.

1740
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,960
 Thank you so much, Smart Scoop, if you want to send us a Scooperty or a Price is Skryte

 And the following scoops all gather around another scoop and spoof all over them until

1779
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,120
 they just can't spoof anymore.

 I love you all.

1790
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,280
 Thank you all so much.

1791
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:50,200
 I just want to put a button on this and just say, we probably haven't, shout out in a while,

1792
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,120
 you can always reach us over email.

1793
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,160
 Oh yeah.

1794
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,960
 Our name @HeyScoops, Matt, Paul and Jacob @HeyScoops.

1795
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:03,320
 So if you actually want to talk to us about what we're doing, or maybe want to express

1796
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:08,360
 your feelings or something like that, please write us.

1797
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,080
 We often write back.

1798
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:16,000
 And people send me emails on the main line all the time that are just questions that

1799
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,920
 I don't read on the air.

1800
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,560
 So if you have a question or a thought on the show or anything, you can send it to us

1801
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,160
 over there and we'll just reply back to you.

1802
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,600
 If we don't reply back to you, it's just because the email got buried, send it to us again

1803
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,200
 or find us on social media, you can DM us on whatever social media we're on and we'll

1804
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,200
 get back to you.

1805
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,200
 Yeah.

1806
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,400
 And in the event, again, if you were serious, we decided to just try to do something fun

1807
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,600
 and lean in while we were homeless with our churn.

1808
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,340
 And knowing that we probably weren't going to get another churn all ready to rock before

1809
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:53,960
 Scoop Fest, and so we thought this is like a fun way to shake up the format a little

1810
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,960
 bit after 1,200 episodes.

1811
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:01,160
 Oh, Scoli in the chat, though, wants to chat about Israel and Age of Consent laws.

1812
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
 Okay.

1813
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
 So we can just shift.

1814
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
 Let's get that.

1815
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,160
 We can shift cleanly right over to that.

1816
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,160
 Let's get that up there.

1817
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,160
 No problem.

1818
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,440
 Oh, Winter Scoop says, "I can confirm that they reply to emails."

1819
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
 It's true.

1820
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,440
 Well, you can reach all of us on the socials in some manner.

1821
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,440
 Oh, yeah.

1822
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,360
 We are remarkably easy to get ahold of if you want to get ahold of us to talk to.

1823
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,960
 Rather accessible.

1824
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,500
 And we do appreciate the hell out of every one of you guys who contribute to the success

1825
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:30,840
 of this podcast, whether it is just listening or participating or actually sending stuff

1826
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,960
 through Patreon, whatever level you can do, we really appreciate it.

1827
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,040
 And I'm really loving this Zoom stuff.

1828
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:43,040
 I think we're going to keep this up for a while anyway and see where we can go with

1829
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,040
 it.

1830
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,040
 Yeah.

1831
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,040
 Yeah.

1832
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,680
 I mean, the show, yeah, we're always going to be changing the show up.

1833
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,480
 But yeah, we've got the Zoom thing going now.

1834
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,480
 It is fun for us.

1835
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,860
 So we like seeing all of your pretty faces there in the Zoom chat.

1836
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:59,080
 We like seeing everybody interact with us over on Twitch as well.

1837
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,200
 That is TheBucketShow.com right over there on Twitch.

1838
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,220
 That's always up and running at the same time that we're on the Zoom, so you can always

1839
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,640
 check us out over there.

1840
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,640
 And I hope you do.

1841
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,640
 I hope you do.

1842
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,640
 All right.

1843
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,520
 Yeah, maybe it was a latter day scoop in the chat mentions though.

1844
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
 Hopefully it was just a joke that landed poorly.

1845
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,520
 Maybe it was.

1846
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,520
 Who knows?

1847
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,520
 Yeah.

1848
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,520
 Maybe it was a scooperty.

1849
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,520
 I think it was just a joke.

1850
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,520
 It's true.

1851
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
 And it was a brand new scooperty.

1852
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,520
 Like they just sent that in too.

1853
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
 I think it was just a joke.

1854
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,520
 Yes.

1855
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
 Maybe it was.

1856
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,520
 Maybe it was just a joke that landed a little weird.

1857
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,520
 I appreciate that a lot.

1858
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,520
 That scooperty too.

1859
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,520
 It was a good scoop.

1860
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,520
 I do too.

1861
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,520
 I'm already going for a long walk after this, guys.

1862
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,520
 It's too late.

1863
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,520
 I'm already crabby.

1864
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,520
 Matt's crabby.

1865
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,520
 Look out.

1866
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,760
 If you see somebody walking down the street with two kitchen tongs held over their head

1867
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,760
 like crab claws.

1868
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,760
 That's right.

1869
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,760
 Going for a long walk.

1870
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,760
 That's Matt Donnelly.

1871
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,760
 A long crab walk to think about it.

1872
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,760
 Yeah.

1873
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,760
 Scoopfest is right around the corner.

1874
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,400
 Can't wait to see everybody there.

1875
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
 Really looking forward to playing.

1876
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400

1877
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,400
 Come check us out.

1878
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,400
 Improv with Matt at the show.

1879
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,240
 So if you're even in just the area and you can make it out to the improv show, if you're

1880
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:01,080
 not coming out to Scoopfest, coming out to the bucket show on that Wednesday night, it's

1881
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,080
 going to be a great time.

1882
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,080
 Yes.

1883
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,080
 All right.

1884
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,080
 Scoopfest.com.

1885
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,720
 Still tickets available to see us there.

1886
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,800
 Lots of fun on tap for that.

1887
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,600
 We're still locking down a lot of fun details, but it's already going to be so exciting.

1888
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,600
 Oh yeah.

1889
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,600

 See you at the Cone with dirty soda.

1901
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,600
 Dirty Soda Bar at Scoopfest.

1902
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
 Not Guaranteed.

1903
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,600
 Not doctor recommended either.

1904
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,600
 Not recommended.

1905
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,600
 We're making fun.

 The doctor just cringes every time they hear about dirty soda.

1907
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,600
 Oh no.

1908
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,600
 Oh, you can add an extra 1600 calories a day.

1909
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,600
 Fantastic.

1910
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
 Just right to you.

1911
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,600
 See you everybody.

1912
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,600
 See your nose.

1913
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
 Love you.

1914
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,600
 Bye.
