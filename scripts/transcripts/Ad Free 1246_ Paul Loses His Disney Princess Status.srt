1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,260
 Thank you so much ice cream truck drivers. Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,800
 Well, these are the folks that deliver that ice cream straight to your ear holes.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,240

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,100
 I Wanna Scoop Baby, Ice Blue Scoop, and Galactic President Scooper Star McScoops-A-Lot.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,340

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,240
 Could be. Could be. Here's the show.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,740
 Yeah, I'd love to.

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,740
 Great. Let's go.

12
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:34,740
 Yeah, you know, like, whoa, it is kind of like we're desk the scoop fest tends to always be around some fiery times.

13
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,740
 It sure does. Well, the things actually got canceled because of the fucking thing.

14
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,540
 We canceled the Scoopocalypse. Yeah, because of an apocalypse.

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,740
 And I remember having Penn on, you know, when Trump got elected and stuff.

16
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,240
 It was very the first time.

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:09,540
 It is crazy. And I, you know, I actually only got like a direct, like hateful email once for talking about politics on this show from a listener.

18
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:19,740
 OK. And it was when I said, if you don't want to vote, if you want to sit out this election, vote for Joe Biden.

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,840
 And the reason why is because your life will simply be easier.

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,740
 I said you simply elect a guy who doesn't demand to command the news cycle.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,440
 Morning. Yes. And night leading into the Trump's second run for president.

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,640
 Right. When he was when he was running. Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,840
 When he was losing losing to Biden. Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,340
 And that was the only time I got a hateful email from our listeners who was a Trump supporter.

25
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,440
 Oh, interesting. Yeah.

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,140
 I thought you were going to say you got a hatefully not a hateful email,

27
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,940
 but an upset email from from a listener saying that it was going to be more than just ease and convenience.

28
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,140
 I thought I thought it was going to go the other way. But it was it was from a Trump supporter.

29
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:13,340
 Yeah. And it's it is exhausting to have such a petty vindictive egotist in an office.

30
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,740
 And then to have a bunch of people who voted for bear ready to enact things, it's tough.

31
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:27,140
 And so obviously, this is all coming to light in terms of Jimmy Kimmel being taken off the air.

32
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:36,740
 And also, you know, also a week out from the Charlie Kirk assassination, which is a very big deal.

33
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,240
 Yeah, of course. And an awful event.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:52,340
 I think, though, like it's it's it is nuts. Like I basically is like I I don't think anyone doubts where we lean politically on this show.

35
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,040
 It doesn't seem like it. Oh, chaotic and Chad is offering to send me more hateful emails.

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,740
 Yeah, let's let's go for it. Oh, no.

37
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:13,140
 And with Scoopfest on the horizon, I just want to say that like we that we don't pride ourselves on any kind of current political stakes that we don't.

38
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,940
 It's very easy to be divisive, to be galvanizing.

39
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,940
 It's very easy to like to get people to hate something.

40
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,940
 It's very easy to point at something and say, hey, why aren't we hating this enough and getting more people to hate?

41
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,040
 Yeah. And and and and and sometimes I know this privately off air.

42
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:37,140
 We are tempted to. Of course, we are. We are. We are tempted to try to use our platform for good, quote unquote.

43
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,140
 You know, yes, we have opinions and we're loud.

44
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,540
 I mean, we're certainly tempted to share them.

45
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,840
 And I just want to say that like all of these people joining us on Twitch, all these people joining us on the zoom,

46
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,640
 all people sports and patron, all people who download us to their to their apps and listen to us week after week are doing that without us doing that.

47
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,140
 Right. And so I want to say like I'm so thrilled to be going to school fast to be spending time with scoops at this time

48
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:14,340
 because it's just like these people are here for us without us doing bullshit take tactics to maintain our status.

49
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,540
 Yeah, I think that's exactly it.

50
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,940
 Right now in this current everything community building is of the utmost importance.

51
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:32,640
 And we have been extremely fortunate in that we have built a very lovely community in the online space where that is a difficult thing to do.

52
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,440
 And that it has been realized in the 3D space is even more impressive and wonderful.

53
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:47,440
 The fact that our scoop fest events have been such highlights for all of us, I think the three of us especially just look forward to these things.

54
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,740
 You know, and again, like I was just saying before in the chat and before we got started recording, I'm just so grateful to all of our listeners.

55
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,240
 You guys really fill my heart with a lot of hope even in these dark times.

56
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:07,640
 And double-O Groovy in the in the Twitch chat says MPBA make politics boring again.

57
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
 Yeah, for real.

58
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,940
 Yeah, you know, you know, we're talking, you know, we're looking around talking about like, no, no one speaks for the greater good.

59
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,540
 No one speaks for the cooler has prevailing.

60
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:28,740
 You know who did? Joe Biden, you know, and he's unpopular and he is reviled and taken down by his own party left and right.

61
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,540
 And if you look back on what the guy said all the time, he really was always trying to speak for the greater good.

62
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,640
 And I'm thinking about him a lot this past week.

63
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:43,640
 I just want to say something like, you know, all that was kind of a lead up for me to say something that I've been kind of biting my tongue on because I know, you know,

64
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,040
 but I want to say this just in a cool calm way.

65
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,240
 If you because we have listeners of the trans community in our community, of course,

66
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,840
 and I feel very lucky that we that we do because we're three cisgender straight white dudes.

67
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:09,940
 You know, if you are in any kind of gathering and the word trans comes up

68
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,640
 and the next word out of someone's mouth is sports, you are failing as an ally.

69
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
 Yeah, it's bad.

70
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:28,940
 It is an absolute fucking tactic like it matters in any way to anyone.

71
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,140
 Matt's getting broken up. So I'm going to talk for a second.

72
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:47,940
 But like it it matters so little to everyone involved usually except for the trans person that's being yelled at and victimized for living their life.

73
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,940
 It is such nonsense.

74
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,340
 I grew up in an area where high school sports, high school athletics, especially high school football was huge, huge.

75
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:05,040
 One of my classmates from high school is one of the current Thursday night football announcers on Amazon Prime.

76
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,240
 We and he was the second best player on our football team.

77
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,940
 We had a hugely successful football team. The town was behind it.

78
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,040
 The school was behind it.

79
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,340
 It was a big fucking deal out of all of those people that played all those sports and did all those things.

80
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:31,740
 You know, a couple of the top guys went on to great success in professional sports and everyone else, everyone else,

81
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,240
 all the hundreds of other people who were involved in it just when I was in school.

82
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:45,440
 They went on to have perfectly normal lives that have nothing to do with high school athletics in any way at all or school athletics in any way at all.

83
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:55,740
 And to make that into such a big talking point, fighting point for people who are trans,

84
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:04,340
 just making one more thing for people to have to deal with that no one really cares about in the first place is maddening.

85
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,840
 It's also it is so it is so it's insanity.

86
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,640
 It's unfortunately even dumber than that, Jacob.

87
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:19,340
 Like in real life, like it is simply that yes, it is simply that that's the only aspect of trans support that polls.

88
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,440
 Right. Right.

89
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,740
 So when it comes to people being able to choose their own gender for their documents,

90
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,940
 when it comes to people choosing their own gender for protection in the workplace,

91
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,640
 when it comes to people to choose their own gender, when it comes to forming their own families, that polls left.

92
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,440
 And those are the things that actually affect real life.

93
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:47,440
 And so the fact that any time I hear the word trans come up and the next thing out of someone's fucking mouth is sports is already a loss.

94
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,740
 It's already an L.

95
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,640
 Like we're already just moving the argument to a place where we're not talking about humanity anymore.

96
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,540
 Right. And so like I'm just I just want to say this full throatedly like like just be aware of it.

97
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:11,840
 Like if if if trans rights comes up and next person brings up sports, you have to get it off of sports as fast as you can.

98
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,640
 You just have to get people stop talking about sports. You just have to do.

99
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,740
 That's a good call. That's a good call.

100
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:32,840
 I think I think, too, to your point, Matt, and for me, this all comes down to people who have not experienced the world.

101
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:45,840
 Right. Yeah. They have isolated themselves to a degree or at least tried to where they don't come in contact with different people from different backgrounds and different situations.

102
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:55,440
 Right. Right. And once you get to know people and you see people are people, that's it.

103
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,940
 Then you understand the frivolity and ludicrousness of these arguments.

104
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:10,140
 If look, there are there are people trying to categorize trans groups as terrorist organizations.

105
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:20,540
 Right. There was a rumor of one of the many shootings that took place this month that one of the one of the perpetrators was a trans person.

106
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,640
 And there's immediately voices that say they want to introduce legislation to stop trans people from owning weapons.

107
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:40,740
 Huge, huge and to criminalize counselors talking to children who come to them to talk about, you know, possibly being trans and all like taking away.

108
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:53,840
 It was it was remarkable how fast everything moved as soon as there was a hint that a bad person or somebody a person who did a terrible thing might have been trans.

109
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:06,440
 It was it was it was honestly remarkable and surprising to me how fast everything moved to try to get legal ducks in a row to attack trans people instantly.

110
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:14,840
 I said, if you have been able to get all of these legal ducks in a row so quickly this whole time, why are we still having mass shootings?

111
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,640
 Well, it's like if it's this easy to do the legal process, what are we doing?

112
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,540
 Well, that's exactly it. That's that that that is the most infuriating thing about all of this for me, too.

113
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:33,940
 Jacob is how quickly we're seeing so many of the supposed checks and balances just get farted away.

114
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:49,540
 Oh, yeah. Right. And what who's I mean, there's plenty of people that have said it, but it's like it's astounding how much of civility and government in this country exists on a handshake deal.

115
00:12:49,540 --> 00:13:06,340
 Yeah. Right. And if you can't be trusted and if you don't have love in your heart, if you don't have love and human compassion and understanding for human beings, you're going to think you're going to propose crazy shit.

116
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:12,140
 And it's this fucking it's it's it's it's this attack on these marginalized groups constantly.

117
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,740
 And I don't know how people can't see it, but they're coming for your ass, too.

118
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,540
 It's it's it's a matter of hours before you are on the wall.

119
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,040
 It is starting with the most marginalized groups out there.

120
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,840
 Yeah. And it is moving bigger.

121
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,940
 That is that is we can all see it happening.

122
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,240
 Let's just look at it.

123
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,240
 They could come for our podcast network next and we would lose tens upon tens of dollars.

124
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,040
 Yes. Do you understand?

125
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,140
 Actually, hold on.

126
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,740
 ABC is actually on the phone. Oh, shit. We ABC has canceled us.

127
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,140
 Oh, my God. Guys, guys, ABC.

128
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,040
 I didn't know we were on ABC. I don't know.

129
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,140
 Canceled on ABC. It's so fucked up.

130
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,440
 I mean, you can no longer find this podcast on ABC.

131
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
 Are you kidding me? Undeniable fact.

132
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
 Undeniable fact. Wait a minute.

133
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,140
 We are no longer on ABC.

134
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,840
 That means I have to give up my Disney princess status.

135
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,140
 Fuck you. You do. You're no longer a Disney princess. God damn it.

136
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,440
 That was the highlight of my life. You can look at all of their apps.

137
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,940
 We are not on there anywhere. We're not.

138
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,040
 We're not. No. Bunch of bullshit.

139
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,140
 Canceled by ABC.

140
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,640
 And I already had a complicated relationship with Disney.

141
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:34,240
 But I should say complicated in case anyone's new to the podcast.

142
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
 My mom died in Disney World.

143
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,940
 Okay, let's reframe it.

144
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,740
 She was a victim of cancel culture.

145
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,640
 She couldn't understand.

146
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,340
 She thought if there's a trans person playing women's basketball,

147
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
 she couldn't take it anymore.

148
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,640
 Oh, Lord.

149
00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:00,040
 You know, yeah, by the way, I want to shout out a couple people.

150
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,140
 One is Justin Robert Young.

151
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,740
 I think a lot of people did a really bad job reporting on this Kimmel thing.

152
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,440
 And Justin Robert Young did a fantastic job breaking down the steps

153
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,140
 and how it went down and when things happen with the chairman of the FCC.

154
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,140
 Your relationship with the affiliates to do that new guy.

155
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,840
 If you haven't seen any clips of that new guy, what a slimeball.

156
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
 He is a character.

157
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,840
 Yeah, I mean, like that's the thing.

158
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,840
 If the chairman, I don't care any administration, right?

159
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,740
 I don't care left or right.

160
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,740
 If you have the chairman of the FCC taking like football,

161
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,840
 like victory laps on a media tour, it's crazy.

162
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
 Something bad is happening.

163
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,940
 Yeah, it's crazy.

164
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,440
 Yeah.

165
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,840
 You can look at his actual Twitter account.

166
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,440
 It's like what the fuck is this guy on?

167
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
 Yeah, don't worry though,

168
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,440
 because the head of the FBI is there to reel him in.

169
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,040
 Right, right, right checks and balances everybody.

170
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,140
 Yeah, Matt Bellamy, no problem.

171
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,140
 Matt Bellamy from the town podcast.

172
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,340
 Also did a really great job of just breaking down the politics

173
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,340
 of what it means to provide programming to affiliates

174
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,240
 still in this modern era and the kind of conflicts you went into.

175
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,440
 And so basically like it's interesting.

176
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,540
 And then I finally, I'm going to shout out my man Bill Simmons,

177
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,940
 who's the most popular podcaster.

178
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,440
 He was a popular sports podcaster.

179
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,140
 He famously was a Kimmel writer for a year and a half in the early years of Kimmel.

180
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,840
 He left ESPN to write for Kimmel.

181
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,540
 I didn't realize that's like a 22-year ongoing thing.

182
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,740
 I didn't realize he'd been doing that so long.

183
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
 I didn't realize Kimmel was such a thing.

184
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,540
 Oh, I mean, he's been on the air for a while.

185
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,040
 I know that now.

186
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,340
 He tried to retire once and they just talked him out of it.

187
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,740
 I guess you're right.

188
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,640
 But he really helped talk me off the ledge from the Kimmel standpoint,

189
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,040
 not from the government taking power standpoint.

190
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,440
 Thank you for clarifying.

191
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,040
 But basically he was like, hey, you know, when I got fired from ESPN,

192
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,240
 everyone thought I would do, you know, you can't make a living in sports

193
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
 without being attached to ESPN.

194
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,940
 And basically he was pointing out that like these affiliates in these red states

195
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,940
 who want advertising for the local news that Kimmel comes on after and carries, right?

196
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 These people are very happy to follow in line with the FCC chair

197
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,540
 and say, let's never air him, right?

198
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,840
 And Disney's only power to fight back and say, all right, well, if you don't want Kimmel,

199
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 I bet you also don't want football and you don't want all these other things that we provide.

200
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,540
 Right.

201
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,740
 And that's where the fight is going to be happening behind the scenes right now.

202
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,340
 OK. And then if you take Kimmel off the air right now,

203
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,040
 you're going to have a bunch of people who live.

204
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,640
 Basically, blue state city people watch things on streaming

205
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,540
 and red state stick in the mud people watch things on TV still.

206
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,540
 And and and and you're supposed to program for both of these people in the modern era

207
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,540
 at a time where we are in the middle of what I mean, it's undeniable.

208
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,940
 A basic civil culture war in our.

209
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,140
 Well, and to Matt, also, there is it's a huge conversation to have.

210
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,640
 And I don't even know how to scrape at it.

211
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,140
 But you said local broadcasters.

212
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,240
 I don't think there's been such a thing for the last 20 years.

213
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,440
 Ever since the conglomeration of everything, you know, everything's been bought up.

214
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,240
 You've got maybe four blocks of, quote unquote, local broadcasters like they've

215
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,440
 you've seen you can see tons and tons of clips of of local broadcasters.

216
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,740
 You're talking about Sinclair broadcasting.

217
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,640
 Exactly. That's one of that's one of them.

218
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,340
 Yeah. And next are those are the two ones that are fighting against Kimmel.

219
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,440
 Those were that are very always been probably leaning.

220
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,140
 These are the people that have on their local fields.

221
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,440
 They hand monologues to exactly all of their anchors in every market.

222
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,140
 And they make the exact same thing.

223
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,540
 So there's no local news. It's just programmed.

224
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,940
 And that's it. And this is this next star is up for a quote unquote merger.

225
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,840
 Right. Right.

226
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,240
 And where they break the rule of you can't have more than 39 percent of affiliates

227
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,840
 in North America, which is already insane, already insane.

228
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,040
 And the number they're trying to get to, do you know the number?

229
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,740
 If this deal goes through, do you know how many affiliates

230
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,740
 they will control in the in the country? I don't.

231
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,540
 I have read 82 percent. Jesus.

232
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,640
 Yeah. 82 percent is the number that I keep reading.

233
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,740
 And these and this is the thing. It's because.

234
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,840
 Oh, shit. ABC just canceled this again.

235
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,540
 Ah, damn it. It's true.

236
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,540
 Yeah. If you look on any Disney website, you will not find us on it.

237
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,740
 No, no, you won't.

238
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,040
 82 percent winner scoop.

239
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,640
 Oh, winner scoop is in the chat is saying 82 percent. Yeah.

240
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,240
 Yeah. And the reason why this is happening, by the way, is because old media is dying.

241
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,140
 Yeah. But while it's dying.

242
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,940
 Oh, yeah. This is the death throes.

243
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
 Older people are watching it still all the time.

244
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,740
 All the people who don't evolve with with modern technology watch it even more.

245
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,540
 Right. Right. And so.

246
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,540
 These people have seized on the opportunity to influence the oldest generation.

247
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,640
 And I think it's just the most frustrating thing about all this stuff.

248
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,540
 Right. MSNBC, CNN, Fox News,

249
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,140
 the average median age of these people are all upper 70s.

250
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,540
 Right. Sure. Of course.

251
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,940
 And these are people who are supposed to be enjoying the life well worked.

252
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,040
 You know, they're supposed to be trusting of the next generation to carry the nation wherever it's going to go.

253
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,540
 And instead, they've been taught to hate and be paranoid

254
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,240
 and despise these younger people who have no idea what they're doing.

255
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,140
 These younger people, these younger people who are in their 60s.

256
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,940
 Right. Right. Right. That's the crazy.

257
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,740
 These younger people who are also retired.

258
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,340
 Yeah, there are no younger people involved in any of this.

259
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:48,140
 I think AOC is the only younger person voice that I would even classify as younger person in the government.

260
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,640
 But that's what I said at the top of the show.

261
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 Like there's just so much money, even if she's 35, by the way, she definitely classifies as younger.

262
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,340
 Yeah. There's so much money in pointing at something and saying, be afraid of that and hate that.

263
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,840
 Hate that over the head of that over there.

264
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,540
 Afraid is the word.

265
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,640
 Afraid is the fucking word that drives me crazy in that because I really don't think or I know it doesn't.

266
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 It doesn't start at least as as hatred and anger.

267
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240
 It just starts as fear.

268
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
 All of it just starts as fear.

269
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,740
 Somebody is coming for you.

270
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,440
 Somebody is going to, you know, riot in your town.

271
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,540
 They're going to loot.

272
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,240
 They're going to steal things from your shop.

273
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,940
 They're going to destroy the town.

274
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,240
 They're going to burn down buildings.

275
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
 They're going to flip over cars.

276
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,640
 They're going to do all these things.

277
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,040
 You have to take action.

278
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,740
 You have to like it's all fear based and there's not that much out there to be afraid of.

279
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,340
 No. Well, that's just it.

280
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,640
 I mean, we've won as far as when we were born.

281
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
 We were born into the best time in human history.

282
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,140
 If you look at all the statistics legitimately, everything is on the decline so far as crime and all that kind of stuff.

283
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,840
 Of course.

284
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,540
 But, you know, everything can be twisted and jacked up.

285
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,640
 It's pretty great.

286
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:14,240
 So Simmons basically was like, you know, the famous story of Lorne Michaels working on, I think, Laughin when the Smothers brothers were taking on Nixon, right?

287
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,940
 Oh, yeah.

288
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,640
 And Lorne Michaels always said you can take it to the brink, but don't become a martyr.

289
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,140
 You become a martyr, it's short-sighted.

290
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,840
 You take it to the brink and then you fall back and you stay on the air.

291
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,340
 You do anything to stay on the air.

292
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,040
 Yes.

293
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:43,840
 And so Kimmel's in this place where obviously they're demanding he donates to Charlie Kirk's charities, on-air apologies, all this laundry list of demands that ultimately they still wouldn't be happy with if he did anyway.

294
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,640
 Right.

295
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,940
 And that's what kind of created the suspension.

296
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:59,940
 And, you know, Simmons' point is, hey, that was true when TV mattered more than the personality.

297
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,640
 Yeah, that's true.

298
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,240
 And he pointed out Conan O'Brien.

299
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,840
 He said look at Conan O'Brien.

300
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,940
 Conan O'Brien did everything to stay on the air, to stay relevant.

301
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:16,940
 And then when they finally got rid of his TBS show, he reinvented himself in his own media format and became more relevant than when he was on TBS.

302
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,240
 And it just owes to the Oscars and everything else.

303
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,640
 And we still know who Conan O'Brien is and all that stuff.

304
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:42,940
 And so Simmons' point, which was really like, oh, shit, was like, hey, all these late-night people are extremely talented and still extremely famous and can do a lot of things with themselves as a platform while, sure, late-night television is dying, but Colbert and Kimmel and all these guys will go nowhere.

305
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
 Yeah, yeah, no, exactly.

306
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
 They're staying in the public eye.

307
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
 They're staying out there.

308
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:55,340
 The only thing that I fear, Matt, and I had this exact same thought today, even regarding our little platform, is that--

309
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,540
 Again, we cannot afford to lose the 50, sometimes $65 we make off of our network every month.

310
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:06,940
 But the thing is, like, the trouble is, it's who controls the pipes.

311
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,240
 That's what it comes down to.

312
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,640
 Yes.

313
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,140
 Who controls the pipes.

314
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:17,240
 And right now, Mario, right now, YouTube is kind of the thing, but that's Google.

315
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,740
 So, you know, like, what else has that--

316
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,140
 I mean, nothing else has that large of an appeal.

317
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,340
 And YouTube's been weird the last couple months.

318
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:35,840
 So I don't fucking know, like, what platform do they go to next where the pipes aren't already rigged?

319
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,340
 Is there something?

320
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,840
 Vinyl.

321
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,740
 You might be right, Jacob.

322
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,040
 You might be right.

323
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,840
 This could be shipping vinyl.

324
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,240
 Man, I mean, it could be mixtapes.

325
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,340
 We might be sharing mixtapes on the corner before this is all over.

326
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,840
 Physical media is exactly right.

327
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
 It's all coming back.

328
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,340
 Thirsty's right.

329
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
 That's why I got my stack of movies over here.

330
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,340
 And I'm like, I'm so glad that I've got all the physical media.

331
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,940
 I'm so sad I got rid of my CDs.

332
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,740
 It's true.

333
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,540
 It's crazy.

334
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,340
 You know, like, you know, the plot of every second Godzilla movie is, like, another monster and they fight each other.

335
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,840
 Right.

336
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,340
 So, yeah, YouTube is a little cuckoo.

337
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,740
 And can you imagine the FCC trying to come for YouTube and what that would happen?

338
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,140
 No.

339
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,440
 I really think here's the thing.

340
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,740
 Like, if you want to talk about one of the failings.

341
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,140
 We probably won't have to imagine it for too long.

342
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,840
 Well, the thing is, you want to look at the failings of, I really think that Joe Biden and Trump and who was president before that?

343
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,340
 Trump and then Obama.

344
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,440
 Obama, yeah.

345
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,940
 None of these people, I think, really, truly fathomed the amount of money and world influence that these companies truly have.

346
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
 Yeah, no.

347
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:57,040
 I think when Facebook started, when Amazon started, when these companies started up and even, you know, before COVID.

348
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:08,040
 I mean, as recently as like before COVID, I don't think anyone, including us, probably, had any real grasp on the extent of the influence.

349
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,140
 That was going to be part of these platforms.

350
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,940
 Yeah.

351
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:31,140
 I mean, yeah, I'm just saying that like, you know, I mean, Apple invests 50 billion in a year in job training and facilitating every aspect of their company in China.

352
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,040
 And then they show up at the White House with a million dollar bribe for the president, right?

353
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,340
 Right.

354
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:42,540
 And 50 billion to 1 million, it's not hard to figure out the scale of what's worth distracting the president with shiny things for.

355
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,840
 Yeah.

356
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,240
 I mean, like, so it'll be interesting.

357
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,540
 I don't think YouTube is like the I don't think there's like there's a great answer.

358
00:26:51,540 --> 00:27:02,140
 I don't think it's a Shangri-La area for unfiltered speech, because part of part of what annoys us is that part of total freedom is conspiracy theorists can say whatever they want.

359
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
 Right, of course.

360
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:12,040
 And so, you know, part of the cesspool of where we're at is is also part of the total freedom that we have actually have.

361
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,340
 So it's it's really it's it's it's so complicated.

362
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:22,140
 I think you just have to be I honestly get to spend more time with faces of actual people.

363
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:32,940
 I think is what actually that's honestly what that's what I'm trying to do by having these free classes and getting into teaching again is just to be face to face with human beings once more.

364
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,140
 It seems like that was like the hugely obvious lesson that came from COVID.

365
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,240
 Yeah, right. And none of us learned it.

366
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,740
 No, like it was like, hey, boy, did we all go fucking crazy when we had to be by ourselves and locked down in our houses.

367
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,940
 Boy, did we all go fucking nuts.

368
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
 Right. And then we go, you know, the answer to that.

369
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,740
 What if you talk to a computer instead of a person?

370
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,740
 And I was like, great, let's invest billions in that.

371
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,340
 I was like, didn't we? It's like, oh, you know, chat to me.

372
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,540
 He's taking over therapy. Good.

373
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,840
 Like, wait, we didn't learn to talk to a human like at all.

374
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,240
 So I don't know. And again, this is this is the most kind of high horsey we get on this show.

375
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,540
 And I don't want to get to whatever.

376
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,340
 And I'll try to find some funny story to divert from the moment here.

377
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,140
 Real quick. It's a lot right now.

378
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
 Yeah. Yeah, it is a lot.

379
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,240
 Right. Yeah, we're all we're all going through a lot.

380
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,140
 And it is. Yeah, sorry, Paul, go ahead. Go ahead. No, go finish.

381
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,740
 Oh, no, I was going to piggyback on what Matt said earlier.

382
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,840
 It is it is frustrating for us.

383
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,540
 It's frustrating for the three of us because we do have a platform and we do have lots of opinions.

384
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,340
 But it's simply not what this show is.

385
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,940
 And it's not what we've what we've built this show to be.

386
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,240
 And it's not what the scoops have built the show to be nor should it be that we have some escapist entertainment.

387
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,640
 And that's what we're going to keep providing.

388
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,540
 But I do think it is important from time to time to let people know, hey, shit's weird.

389
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,140
 We love you. Hang tight. We've got you.

390
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,540
 You know what side of the fence we're on? Yeah, I really think we do have a lot of listeners who aren't in our country.

391
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,340
 And I think they don't know how our television system works with network doesn't.

392
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,540
 Yeah. Networks and affiliates and that kind of stuff.

393
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:17,540
 And so I think that's what makes this Kimmel situation so galvanizing and untenable.

394
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,840
 Oh, the Kimmel thing, I was actually getting to Absinthe.

395
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,740
 It broke on the New York Times that all of it had happened as I was parking at Caesar's Palace.

396
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:37,040
 Yeah. So as I'm walking into Caesar's, all I was doing was searching YouTube for the monologue,

397
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,440
 for the offending monologue from Jimmy Kimmel.

398
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,040
 And I found it and I watched it and I thought I had found the wrong thing.

399
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:55,040
 Yep. Because there's not even that moment of like, oh, in the audience when he says anything like because he doesn't say anything.

400
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,040
 No, he doesn't say anything critical of Charlie Kirk in that monologue.

401
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,440
 Absolutely not. The most the most terrifying thing about all of this.

402
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:15,640
 And it goes back to what we were talking about about trans rights is that the attempt here is to label any modicum of dissent,

403
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:22,140
 anything, anything, doesn't have to be dissent, just to label anything as wrong.

404
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,440
 Right. And then you can just be and they're trying to push it to where you can just be blown up.

405
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,640
 Oh, yeah, that doesn't look quite right. Kaboom.

406
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:39,140
 Yeah. I mean, that's that's what we're looking at some bills in current legislation right now that are trying to ratify,

407
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:47,340
 like giving certain individuals like 007 license to kill shit. It's like, yeah, pump the fucking brakes here, guys.

408
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:55,240
 And also you have like government officials encouraging other government officials and their constituents to you know,

409
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,040
 if you see someone post something negative about Charlie Kirk, call their employer.

410
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,040
 Hey, work straight up and try to get them fired in their job.

411
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:12,340
 That doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about in Nevada and in Las Vegas County, Clark County.

412
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,040
 Teachers have been unassigned classrooms because of the social media posts.

413
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,240
 And we already have an extreme teacher shortage here.

414
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,540
 We have an extreme teacher shortage here and we're kicking teachers out of class and that is of social media.

415
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,340
 And that, too, is part of the plan, I believe, Jacob.

416
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,740
 Oh, no, I think which is grotesque in and of itself, too.

417
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,040
 It's like I don't think that's a quiet plan. I don't think that's a plan that anybody is being coy about.

418
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,740
 I think they're just saying it out loud. Yeah.

419
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,440
 Like, well, we're going to get rid of all the conspiracy theories.

420
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,640
 I criticize you on the conspiracy theories.

421
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
 It's not a theory when they're saying this is what we're doing. Exactly.

422
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,140
 No, I think. Yeah, and you hate your man, Jimmy Fallon.

423
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,640
 I know you hate him. He stepped up to the plate last night.

424
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,140
 He did. He did. He stepped up to the plate last night.

425
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,140
 But, you know, he's got to figure that his days are numbered.

426
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,540
 Right. But OK, so here's I'll never forgive him for that hair toss a moment.

427
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:07,340
 No, I know. I know. I know. But I mean, right now, Fallon has to figure that he's not going to be on the air for months.

428
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,140
 Who the fuck knows? No, no, no, no, no, no.

429
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,840
 This is what everyone needs to understand.

430
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,840
 This is what everyone is doing by like the shitty reporting.

431
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,840
 OK, even when Colbert went on the Emmys and said, hey, I have 200 people in the back

432
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,140
 that could use some work if you're hiring. Right.

433
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,640
 And that joke came out. OK, if he said that five years ago, the number would have been 300.

434
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
 OK, yeah, that's how much that's the average.

435
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
 That was the average workforce of a show like that.

436
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,240
 Network television is dying. Yeah, yeah.

437
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,640
 And late night shows are expensive to produce. Right.

438
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,840
 And so if you're the CEO of a company that is publicly traded,

439
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,140
 would you rather be left be the one CEO actually holding the bag when it finally dies?

440
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,540
 Or would you like to say, oh, the president's an asshole.

441
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,040
 I guess we've got to go along with what he says. Yeah, yeah.

442
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,440
 And so this is what's happening.

443
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,740
 These networks are are ducking out on these shows.

444
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,240
 It is convenient for them to do so. Sure.

445
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,440
 It is nice for them to say, like, oh, sorry, we're going to do political pressure.

446
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,540
 Yeah, right. Because paying even these lawsuits,

447
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,140
 paying him 15 million dollars is still cheaper than keeping these things going.

448
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:22,140
 So yes, as long as NBC wants to fight the fight, it'll be going along with it.

449
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:31,340
 But like the Colbert report went off air because that show was going to get killed no matter what.

450
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,240
 That was behind the scenes that was going to die.

451
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,240
 And right around that time, according to the union rules, they have to negotiate with the producers

452
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,140
 and they basically had to tell them about what their new deal was going to be.

453
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:50,540
 And they were basically going like, oh, well, if we have to tell them we're not going to renegotiate a new deal,

454
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,340
 then we basically are telling them they're going to go off air. We might as well tell them they're going to go off the air.

455
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,940
 You're talking about the new Colbert late night show, not Colbert report.

456
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,840
 No, no, no. I'm sorry. Colbert late night show.

457
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
 Yeah, yeah. The most reason.

458
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,640
 But the news broke and then people didn't take credit as if it was because he was criticizing Trump that that was happening.

459
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:14,040
 Right. And Paramount was still trying to get their merger approved.

460
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,440
 So they had no problem saying, oh, yep, the president did do that because it's going to help them get their merger approved.

461
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,740
 But they were eliminating that show as a cost cutting measure to get the merger finances to land up anyway.

462
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
 Right. That shows going away no matter what.

463
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,340
 Yeah. Yeah. So that's all weird.

464
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,740
 The stockholder thing stuff is just so weird.

465
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:43,640
 Basically, like these are all like the reason why I feel like we're taking crazy pills is because the behemoths of media that we grew up with are dying.

466
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,040
 And so they don't have the fight to fight.

467
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,240
 Yeah, they don't have that clout anymore. They don't have there's nowhere they don't have a standing to fight like they used to.

468
00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:00,140
 And so this is all just political advantageism or taking advantage of something that's dying.

469
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:12,640
 Basically, they're putting these they're putting these odd nepo baby figureheads in charge of these mega corporations that have no experience in running the industry and no experience in the industry that they're now helming to just oversee the death of them.

470
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:20,340
 And, you know, they're doing the same thing that that they that they did the Toys R Us just on larger entertainment venues.

471
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:26,440
 Yeah, NBC, ABC, CBS, the big the big three are Toys R Us.

472
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,740
 Yeah. Yeah, they're getting they're getting sold off for parts before we know it.

473
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,840
 Yeah. Yeah, it's a shame.

474
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,740
 I just want to say real quick.

475
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,040
 So all right. Are we fairly done with that?

476
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:51,240
 I mean, for the most part, thank you scoops for listening to us prattle on but you know, it was important to say but but I do have a little thing on this.

477
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,640
 So bring us to a close and then we'll do a sponsor.

478
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,240
 We'll do a sponsor spot and scene.

479
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,840
 This is this is tangential.

480
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,540
 This is a different thing I want to talk about.

481
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
 Great. Great. Yeah.

482
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,840
 Yeah, do it. Do you want to sponsor first?

483
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,740
 I thought you said sponsor. Great following sponsor.

484
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,840
 See, this is why we shouldn't stop making poop jokes.

485
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,540
 Our show falls apart.

486
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
 We're bad at not making poop jokes.

487
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,740
 It does. We don't know how to get out of it.

488
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,240
 By the way, Jeffrey was the name of the giraffe in Toys R Us.

489
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,140
 Jeffrey Epstein. Coincidence?

490
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:38,640
 No, probably today's show is brought to you by Paul's football quarter.

491
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,240
 A new sports ball podcast.

492
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:52,440
 Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

493
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:01,040
 Hey there sports fans, Paul Mattingly here with the latest and greatest from not watching a goddamn thing that NFL is doing this whole goddamn season.

494
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:09,640
 I've heard that some football teams have actually played some games and I did catch through my cursory browsing of social media that one Joe Burrow.

495
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,240
 Hope and heart of the Cincinnati Bengals has broken his toe and he won't be able to play games for another three months.

496
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,140
 Just one more example of the idiocy and horrible violence contained within this shit game.

497
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,040
 That's right.

498
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:32,940
 A player whose designation as quarterback keeps him from the most hits and hurts has actually become so injured he can't play for three months just from somebody landing on his foot.

499
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,940
 That sounds pretty gross to me.

500
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,940
 Now back to you, Dick.

501
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,440
 Enter Hayscoops at checkout.

502
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,740
 There's no dick Paul, it's just your own podcast.

503
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,840
 I am dick.

504
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,940
 I am also dick.

505
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,040
 I just didn't get a chance to respond.

506
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,940
 Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Dick.

507
00:37:48,940 --> 00:38:01,440
 Thanks. Thanks beer beer and dick are the two hosts of my podcast on sports.

508
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,040
 Thank you beer.

509
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,940
 I'd like to also say screw everything about the NFL.

510
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,740
 It's a violent horror show and no one should be involved in it.

511
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,340
 Good night.

512
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:15,940
 Good night.

513
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,340
 Good night and local politics say a Nevada state senator was arrested last night.

514
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:30,340
 He was found unconscious in his car at the at a stoplight and the driver's seat.

515
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,840
 The video is just a cop going up and like knocking on his window and be like put your car in park.

516
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,440
 Oh my God.

517
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,440
 Put it in park.

518
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,940
 That's how it starts.

519
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
 Oh my God.

520
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,540
 He says he was not inebriated in any way.

521
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:43,940
 Sure.

522
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,440
 Which I respond then sir, you have a medical condition.

523
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,540
 You need to go to the doctor.

524
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,440
 Alcohol is not the only thing that can impair your driving.

525
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,540
 Right.

526
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,140
 Whatever this is, it's an issue that you need to get it taken care of.

527
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,840
 I think you're just drunk though.

528
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,940
 Holy simoleons.

529
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,040
 What were you going to say, Paul?

530
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,340
 All right.

531
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,240
 So the other day Anne and I went chair shopping, right?

532
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,940
 All right.

533
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,640
 And she got her chair.

534
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,840
 It was it's delivered and she loves it.

535
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,140
 It is a this is her new reading chair.

536
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,440
 It is a transformative thing for her.

537
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,340
 It's wonderful.

538
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,140
 She takes naps in it now.

539
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,640
 It's got the massage and the heat.

540
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,540
 So she's really enjoying herself.

541
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,040
 It's great.

542
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
 So I'm great.

543
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,140
 So happy that the chair is a success and it's in the house.

544
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:37,840
 But while we were heading for the chair, we were discussing my very soon flights out to Vegas and everything.

545
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:47,440
 And she's like, you know, the last two of the last three times I've been to Vegas, I've come back with COVID.

546
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,440
 That's just facts.

547
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,740
 I should say two of the last five times, I guess.

548
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,340
 I think it tricks out pretty good.

549
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:02,140
 But but you know, she's a little concerned and I am too because I don't want that shit anymore.

550
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,040
 So we're like, let's try and see if we can get a COVID shot.

551
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,240
 Because I don't know how it's been for you guys, but it's not easy out here.

552
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:21,140
 We went and got our flu shots at our local Wal-Mart, which is our it's our close spot we use for our pharmacy that's got the our insurance.

553
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:31,240
 You know, so we got our flu shots like three weeks ago, four weeks ago, and they just didn't have the COVID shot yet.

554
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,540
 And they didn't know when they were going to get it.

555
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,640
 They were hoping like October, but that would do me no good because I'm traveling before that.

556
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,340
 So we're sitting in the parking lot of this furniture spot.

557
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:49,240
 And my wife's like, well, let's try and get this going for you at least so that you have some level of protection when you're traveling.

558
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
 And I said, that's a good idea. I'm all for it.

559
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,440
 OK, I'll call my PCP.

560
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,340
 Right. So I call my primary care physician and I get a dude on the line.

561
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,140
 Oh, that's what you meant by PC.

562
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:07,240
 I called my PCP, not my which were calling your dealer, not my PCP.

563
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,040
 So I called my M.E.T.H. and I got a hold of my PCP instead.

564
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:22,540
 No, but the the the person on the other line says, I'm not sure what the status is for COVID shots.

565
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,940
 I'll put you in touch with our other nurse practitioners, whatever.

566
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,640
 I'm on hold for a good three or four minutes and I'm just getting to a point where I'm like, well, this is just silly.

567
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,440
 And then somebody finally picks up and they say hello.

568
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,940
 And I said, hi, I was just calling about the availability of COVID shots.

569
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:48,140
 And this lady says, we don't know when or if we're going to receive any.

570
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,440
 Ah, and this is the medical facility right down the street for me.

571
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,440
 It's like midway between a hospital and a, you know, rehab center, whatever.

572
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,640
 Yeah. But I've gone there for a lot of stuff.

573
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,740
 I go there for my general practitioner, all that kind of thing.

574
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,540
 And my PCP and my PCP. So I'm like, OK, yikes.

575
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:18,540
 I don't know when or if. So I was just like, well, shit, that's not good at all.

576
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:26,440
 And that seems to be the case in a lot of places out here and even Anne's sister who works as a nurse.

577
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:36,440
 They're having like emergency meetings to try and discuss what the plan is moving forward for the distribution of the shots.

578
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,640
 So we're getting pretty nervous. We're like, ah, but we're driving down the street.

579
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:49,440
 What? Three days ago, four days ago. And Anne looks over and she sees at the CVS,

580
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,040
 it says flu shots, COVID shots. And it just pulls right in, drives over.

581
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,540
 We did. We straight up turned around. We straight up turned around and went in.

582
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,740
 We're like, fuck it. They don't take our insurance normally, but let's give it a shot.

583
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:11,340
 Let's give it a shot. So we went in there and we go in and said, you guys got the COVID boosters.

584
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:18,840
 We'd like to get those. And they said, well, it's 65 and up or you have to self attest that you're in a risk thing.

585
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,540
 And I'm like, oh, I'll self attest. Yeah. Self attest. Yeah, I self attest. Let's go.

586
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,340
 And then another lady who was really nice, she's like, let me see your insurance cards.

587
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,940
 And so we gave her our insurance cards and sure enough, she was able to do some finagling on there that we got these covered.

588
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,640
 And we both got our COVID shots. Eat shit, RFK Jr.

589
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,940
 I mean, well, seriously, like it was, it might kill that brain worm.

590
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,340
 Like who the fuck knows when the next time is going to be available.

591
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,340
 But I think I'm grateful that I got that when I did.

592
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:58,540
 So now I can go into Scoop Fest feeling a little better protected, not just for Scoop Fest, just for being in Vegas.

593
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,640
 While I'm here, do you have any medical grade cocaine locked up back there?

594
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,140
 For real, right? I can attest to all kinds of stuff.

595
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:14,240
 I'm pretty sure. I will attest to so much. I'm pretty sure that that's recommended now by the FDC chair.

596
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:23,240
 They say that's pretty good for your for your mental health is to straight up cocaine, crack and heroin.

597
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,940
 Yeah, it's fucking insanity times.

598
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:33,040
 But I thought it was kind of crazy, but I'm very grateful that Ann spotted that and we swung around and went for it and actually got it.

599
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,540
 Poor thing hurt. She's got a reaction on her arm and, you know, like really going through it, feeling kind of lethargic.

600
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:49,340
 I had almost nothing happen this time, but I think I think she's only had covid once, maybe.

601
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:55,740
 And I've gone through it at least two times and that second time I couldn't smell or taste for a little bit.

602
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,740
 So I got it pretty bad that second time. But man, oh, man.

603
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,240
 Yeah, just grateful to have that done. Just crazy.

604
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:10,940
 But how weird that it's getting to like got a fucking pinball around to try and find what should be readily available.

605
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,740
 I don't understand. Liz Warren hammered R.F.K.

606
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,740
 Jr. when they think in front of Congress about it.

607
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,940
 He purposely changed up all the programs and the person they fired.

608
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:29,040
 You know, she's testifying that he's making all these policies without any scientific basis and ignoring the scientific recommendations of qualified people.

609
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,740
 Yes, it's and he's also just do crazy, crazy unqualified for his job.

610
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,940
 That should never be an abomination that it is fucking asshole.

611
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,040
 It's a travesty. He's oddly unqualified.

612
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,540
 Yeah. And all of these, you know, quote unquote middle of the road, you know, on the fence, people voted him in.

613
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,740
 And it's just like regardless of his hearing, like he just simply wasn't just no.

614
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,840
 There's nothing on the resume that you write that person in that job.

615
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,940
 No, it's like hiring a three year old to be a garbage truck driver.

616
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,740
 It's like the fuck are you doing? No, it's not going to work.

617
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:15,640
 It is bizarre. It is bizarre. Yeah, but I'm glad you did, Paul.

618
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,340
 I am I am about to write up a scoop fest.

619
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:25,140
 I got to I got to fly out to Canada where I may never come back the day after.

620
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,840
 Yeah, I'm going to be joining the the Enchanted Princess.

621
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,340
 That's right. I will go from the Enchanted Princess to the Brilliant Lady.

622
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,240
 Brilliant Lady. Oh, brilliant Lady.

623
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,040
 All I do is show my age. Are these boats? Princess.

624
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,640
 These aren't boats, Paul. These are people.

625
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,740
 I am required to give oral sex to two different women in Canada.

626
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,140
 Fair. Yeah, it's a it's a contractual thing.

627
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,440
 It's just it's just a thing. Entertainment. What are you going to do?

628
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,740
 I'm with it. No, the Enchanted Princess is Princess ships always have the name of the ship before the word princess.

629
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,140
 So the Princess ship and then the very new ship.

630
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:12,240
 The Brilliant Lady is the is the name of the new Virgin America ship.

631
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,440
 Not anymore. But what happens is they you know,

632
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:25,840
 my travel is booked by these large corporations that move a thousand guest entertainers across hundreds of ships all over the world.

633
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:33,740
 And so I often have to like get my travel Simon and try to hop on and get myself not the most uncomfortable seat in an airplane.

634
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:40,940
 Right. Yeah. And so, you know, because they booked you in the in the lavatory or something.

635
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,940
 They just they booked me where the seat will be assigned a gate.

636
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,740
 Yes. Right. And so I've not flown Air Canada before.

637
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,740
 Oh, and so these flights are on Air Canada.

638
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,540
 And so I had to basically get myself an Air Canada account,

639
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,540
 you know, load up my passport, all the stuff and I go great to get the account.

640
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,140
 Do you have to like instead of checking to see if you're a robot,

641
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,440
 do they like check to make you describe the flavor of poutine or something?

642
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,940
 How do they how do they do? Yeah, there's a lot of huge poutine questionnaire.

643
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,540
 Yeah, that's what I figured. OK, we get in.

644
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:26,040
 And then and then they say pronounce S. O. R. R. Y.

645
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,140
 And then you have to it's a really tricky and then you're like trick question.

646
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,040
 You should have been saying it this whole time.

647
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,440
 You should if you haven't been apologizing this whole time,

648
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,340
 I'm sorry. See yourself out. Yeah.

649
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:50,240
 So I go to select, you know, an aisle seat on my two flights.

650
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,040
 And then I go to correct it and it says you can't cannot process.

651
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,040
 I'm going weird because metric, right?

652
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,540
 Well, and then I look online and it says if you if you bought your

653
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,540
 your flight through a third party service, you can't upgrade your seat on an Air Canada flight.

654
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,840
 You have to fly directly from Air Canada to upgrade your seats.

655
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,540
 And I go, that can't be right. And I have the app.

656
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,640
 And so I'm there at the app.

657
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,440
 And it's like, you know, I'll see for flight number one, you know, 40 to 40 dollars.

658
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,640
 Yeah. OK. I'll flight first for flight number two.

659
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,840
 Another 20 20 bucks. OK.

660
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:34,540
 And then I click next screen and it says total cost eight thousand nine hundred forty five dollars.

661
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,740
 What happened? Jesus.

662
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,140
 And it says view price summary.

663
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,840
 And I was like, you bet your ass I want to view that price summary.

664
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,240
 Hold on now. Let me just pull up my own calculator here.

665
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,540
 If we want to get the aisle seat here, I'll see that for 40 dollars.

666
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,740
 Yeah. Yeah. 20.

667
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:05,640
 And then and then it ends up to eight thousand nine hundred forty five dollars.

668
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,340
 Wow. Oh, yeah.

669
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,240
 Yeah, that checks out.

670
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,340
 So I told my wife, I said, sorry, I'm losing money this month by going away for three weeks.

671
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:23,940
 But I really need my foot room, you know, he's not just a little bit of money either.

672
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,140
 So then I think these ships pay Matt thirty five thousand dollars a week.

673
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,740
 You know, I'm trying on the laptop. I'm trying on my phone.

674
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,840
 I'm trying on regular. I'm trying on the app.

675
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,040
 You know, I'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

676
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,640
 I try to Canadian scoop crystal in the chat wants to know if it's just if it's just the exchange rate.

677
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:50,940
 Forty two dollars US eight thousand dollars Canadian heavy loony toony turnover there.

678
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,240
 Things got rough. Yeah.

679
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,740
 And so for whatever reason, I go back to the steps and I realize they go,

680
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,440
 oh, have you tried to like an e e upgrade or something like that? And I click on that.

681
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,440
 And it allows you to bid on a higher seat.

682
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,340
 I have seen this. Yes.

683
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,840
 So this is why they don't let you pay for your seat or upgrade from a third party site.

684
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,540
 They basically basically like, oh, did you fuck yourself for the third party site?

685
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,840
 Come into the auction house. Yeah.

686
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:36,440
 You know, join your friends here and the minimum bid is much is more expensive is is between forty dollars and eight thousand dollars.

687
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,940
 Seven thousand nine hundred dollars.

688
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,340
 Who's who's buying an eight thousand dollar plane ticket?

689
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,240
 I think it's just a weird error.

690
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,440
 I don't think that's actually like meant for someone to actually like even if I was making thirty five grand for a gig.

691
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,540
 Eight thousand dollar ticket that that takes a bite.

692
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:59,840
 No, it's got to be like they just put it as that so that you won't change it through that part of the site.

693
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,040
 So you go to the auction, right? That's it.

694
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,240
 Yeah. Yeah. Weird.

695
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,440
 They're like, if you want to pay eight grand, we'll just let you pay eight grand.

696
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,040
 But would really rather you just go to the auction site.

697
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:17,440
 Andy Cheek, the escape to Canada rate has increased lately.

698
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,440
 I mean, honestly, if Air Canada just shot their rates up, U.S.

699
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,240
 to Canada flights, market demand, market demand, that's what it is.

700
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,140
 Maybe that's capitalism.

701
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,840
 Dynamic pricing, dynamic pricing, dynamic pricing.

702
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,440
 God damn it.

703
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,640
 I'll tell you who else uses a lot of dynamic pricing for their international flights.

704
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,540
 But that's the following sponsor.

705
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,240
 Today's show is brought to you by.

706
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,740
 It's the creepy guy who used to host pickup artist seminars, but definitely not safe

707
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:54,240
 or FDA approved air quotes brain pills as seen on the Joe Rogan experience.

708
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,140
 Creepy guy who used to host pickup seminars.

709
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,940
 Definitely not safe. FDA approved air quotes brain pills.

710
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,640
 Hey, you guys looking to expand your mind a little bit?

711
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,140
 Yeah. OK, let's do it.

712
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,740
 So you see my crazy hat, right?

713
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,340
 I got a big crazy hat on peacocking with my crazy hat.

714
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,040
 Well, look right under this hat.

715
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,740
 Look what you see. You see a cranium full of ideas.

716
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,740
 A lot of those ideas stay locked up in my brain.

717
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,440
 Why? Why?

718
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,840
 Because I haven't been taking the right supplements.

719
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,540
 Huh? Supplements.

720
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,440
 Just like you, baby. Your supplements.

721
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,340
 You're smooth and your breath is fresh.

722
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,240
 Supplements. I bet you say that to all the gals.

723
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,340
 I do in an attempt to get at least one of them to respond.

724
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,540
 That's what it's all about.

725
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,040
 It's a numbers game, pal. You say it to every woman.

726
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,740
 You say it to every single woman. Thousands, in fact.

727
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,840
 Yeah. Supplements.

728
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,240
 Supplements. These supplements are perfect.

729
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,640
 They got a drop of Retson, which is still OK so far.

730
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,140
 No links to anything yet.

731
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,040
 But these will open up your brain.

732
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,040
 Oh, what's that you say? You like my dolphin chain?

733
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,640
 Yeah. Check it out. I'm wearing a dolphin on a chain.

734
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:27,740
 You know why? Dolphins utilize a certain evolutionary device

735
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,640
 called echolocation.

736
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,740
 They send out these little squeaks and squawks.

737
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,640
 And whatever that hits comes back to them

738
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,140
 and they can recognize where in space they are.

739
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,340
 It allows them for three-dimensional orientation.

740
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,740
 Even in a place like the ocean, where it's pretty easy to get turned around.

741
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,540
 Oh, man. I don't follow, but it's probably because I haven't taken brain pills.

742
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,740
 That's right, sweet baby. So go ahead and sip on some of this.

743
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,240
 I bet you call all the gals sweet baby.

744
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,940
 I call them all sweet baby.

745
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,540
 Take some of this from my drink that you haven't been watching closely for the last ten minutes.

746
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,840
 Oh, no.

747
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,840
 Go ahead and have a drink.

748
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,240
 Welcome to the red roofie inn, sweetheart.

749
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,140
 Enter AIDS goops, let's check out.

750
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,740
 These aren't brain pills.

751
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,640
 They aren't.

752
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,540
 That was from the gorilla dentist in that Bjork video in 2024.

753
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:29,940
 I love that name. I fucking love that name.

754
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,540
 But yeah, someone in chat talked about that they can emigrate back to Newfoundland.

755
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,440
 I'm actually going to St. John's Newfoundland twice on this three week trip.

756
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,340
 Once with Enchanted Princess and once with Virgin.

757
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,540
 I'm so excited. I went there with Piff.

758
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,540
 I loved Newfoundland so much.

759
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,140
 It was so fun.

760
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,740
 This is Newfoundland is where they have a lot of like the puffins and stuff, right?

761
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,240
 Isn't that where people go to see puffins?

762
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,040
 Yeah.

763
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,440
 Are you able to to consider yourself an honorary Newfie?

764
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
 I don't think so.

765
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,540
 Not yet.

766
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,140
 You've got to have a couple more trips before you can get Newfie status.

767
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:10,440
 I think you have to jump in naked into the water and like catch a fish with your mouth or something, right?

768
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,140
 Here's the thing, which Matt's going to do this time.

769
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,440
 I'm out.

770
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,740
 You know, Penn's ancestry comes from Newfoundland.

771
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,240
 He loves the term Newfie and that they're growing up.

772
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,140
 There was Newfie jokes, right?

773
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,040
 Oh, really?

774
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,340
 Okay.

775
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,040
 Yeah.

776
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,140
 And so Paul was before you joined Fifty Shades.

777
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,640
 We had someone in the cast from who's from Newfoundland.

778
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,940
 Yeah, must have been before.

779
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:42,640
 She's a tall, tall, thin soprano.

780
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,940
 And I it was always funny because I loved I thought Fifty Shades was such a funny show.

781
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,040
 And I love that it ran in Vegas when it did.

782
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,940
 And there's so many other shows that come here that try to be funny that weren't that I was like really happy about it.

783
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,240
 It was a good show.

784
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,640
 She was so ashamed to be in the show.

785
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,240
 It was so obvious.

786
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,640
 It was so fun.

787
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,440
 Oh my gosh.

788
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,840
 It was so it was such a funny thing of like because of the content and whatnot.

789
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,240
 Yes.

790
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:13,740
 If she had any friends in the audience or Pam Pam, whatever they basically she was like so embarrassed that she was in the show.

791
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,940
 And that was really funny.

792
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,140
 But I remember being like you're from Newfoundland.

793
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:24,340
 Yeah, I go you're a Newfie and I watched her face kind of fall and then I still plowed ahead and said what's your favorite Newfie joke?

794
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,840
 And she said I don't have one.

795
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,640
 And I was like, I made a mistake.

796
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,540
 Oh boy.

797
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,040
 I've made a mistake.

798
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:39,240
 I've encountered I've encountered the one unfunny Newfoundlander.

799
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,740
 I have aired.

800
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,340
 I thought I thought this was going one direction.

801
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,340
 I was incorrect.

802
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,240
 My brain said I know I had it off with you and my brain was wrong, wrong, wrong.

803
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,040
 Oh boy.

804
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,040
 It was the first time that Matt approached a woman and said something that was wrong.

805
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:02,840
 But not the last not a lot since then though, and then I call the supplements and then we and we called it a day.

806
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,240
 It's a game of numbers kids.

807
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,340
 It's a game of numbers number.

808
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,840
 Speaking of games of numbers.

809
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,940
 You're about to lose this one.

810
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,940
 It's Jack versus nerd.

811
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,140
 I'll bring it sucker.

812
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,040
 Ladies and gentlemen.

813
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:36,840
 It is time for Jack versus me.

814
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,640
 Explosion of Newfies.

815
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,440
 We got a scooper to come to us today from Keister Sunday.

816
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,840
 It's all about movies.

817
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,940
 We got 80s comedies, 80s horror.

818
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,440
 80s action and 80s sci-fi.

819
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,540
 Paul you're up first.

820
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,340
 Oh man.

821
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,440
 What I can't go wrong.

822
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,340
 I'll go 80s sci-fi for 800.

823
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,640
 I'm just going to shoot the moon literally.

824
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,340
 Whoa, look at him go and probably the best fantasy sci-fi adaptation of all time.

825
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:12,340
 Dolph Lundgren and Billy Barty traveled to Earth to stop Frank Langella and Meg Foster from getting something or destroying something or taking over something.

826
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,940
 Also Courtney Cox is in it.

827
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,040
 Masters of the universe.

828
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,140
 I even knew that one.

829
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,540
 Masters of the universe.

830
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,540
 It's so bad.

831
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,440
 Oh, I love it.

832
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,340
 It is fun ish.

833
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,240
 It's a fun one.

834
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,740
 Oh man.

835
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,840
 Where can I go right?

836
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,640
 Let's see here.

837
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,140
 I'll do 80s action for 200.

838
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,340
 And this violent satire after being pumped full of more rounds than your mother.

839
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:47,940
 The Megacorp OCP crams what remains of Peter Weller back into a tin can and pushes him back onto the streets to fight more crime in the nightmare hellscape that is Detroit.

840
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,440
 Casablanca.

841
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,340
 Casablanca.

842
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,340
 That is a rebel.

843
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,340
 You played it for her.

844
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:58,940
 You can play it for me.

845
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:05,340
 Creep.

846
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,740
 Yes, it was Casablanca.

847
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,140
 Okay, it's me.

848
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:13,740
 I'll try 80s comedies 200 of all the known in the 80s mostly for playing Streetwise Cops and Detectives.

849
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:25,740
 This actor also played rags to riches orphan turned adopted son of a speakeasy proprietor and a rags to riches African Prince.

850
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,840
 Is this Eddie Murphy?

851
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,740
 I think it is just Eddie Murphy.

852
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,540
 God right.

853
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,540
 I'm reading the question to make sure I read it right.

854
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,340
 I think it's Eddie Murphy.

855
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
 Eddie Murphy.

856
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,140
 Yeah.

857
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,740
 Charlie Murphy.

858
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,740
 Paul.

859
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,540
 80s sci-fi for 600, please.

860
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,940
 It's going up the board.

861
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:52,540
 And this 1981 Cronenberg classic Michael Ironside causes the greatest fucking head explosion ever committed to celluloid.

862
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,840
 Oh, that's Scanners.

863
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,440
 Scanners is correct.

864
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,240
 At this point that head explosion is more famous than the movie.

865
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:00,740
 Yeah, it is.

866
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,540
 Definitely.

867
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,740
 Oh, yeah.

868
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,040
 I see that head explosion on so many clip shows and everything.

869
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,140
 They never reference what it's from.

870
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,340
 Yeah.

871
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,340
 Matt.

872
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:14,840
 Exploded like an Aldi hot dog says Latter-day Scoop.

873
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,940
 Paul, did you get any physical Scoop mail lately?

874
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,340
 Not yet.

875
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:18,840
 Oh, no.

876
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,740
 Okay.

877
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,240
 It better come in the next three days.

878
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,740
 I'm out of here for sure.

879
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,340
 My wife's not going to know what to do with it.

880
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:30,540
 If it's an Aldi hot dog.

881
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,040
 I'm sure it's already been microwaved.

882
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,440
 Matt, your turn.

883
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,740
 80s Action 400, please.

884
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:46,340
 In this prequel to Family Matters, Karl Winslow assists that guy who was shot by one of the new kids on the block and stopping Snape from stealing Christmas or something.

885
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:50,040
 I don't really remember much about that night.

886
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,240
 Slurpee Kay, motherfucker.

887
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,340
 Slurpee Kay, motherfucker.

888
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,740
 Die hard.

889
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,440
 Die hard.

890
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,240
 Oh, man.

891
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,240
 I'll try, I don't know, 80s Action.

892
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,340
 We're all staying away from 80s Horror.

893
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,140
 That's pretty funny.

894
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,840
 Shit, Daily Double.

895
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,840
 This prequel began to trend, began the trend of including the main character's name in the titles.

896
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:22,440
 It's considered culturally insensitive for its cameo portrayal of Dan Aykroyd as not being an absurd lunatic.

897
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:30,540
 Also, will someone please shut that woman up?

898
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,840
 I know that line from something.

899
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:39,040
 Will someone please shut that woman up?

900
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,840
 Can't think of what it is, though.

901
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,140
 No, I can't either.

902
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:46,040
 Dan Aykroyd, 80s Action.

903
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,640
 A prequel?

904
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,840
 Why, they're just calling everything a prequel.

905
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,340
 They called Die Hard a prequel to Family Matters a minute ago.

906
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,840
 Oh, okay.

907
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,340
 Yeah, yeah.

908
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,440
 The main character's name is in the title.

909
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,940
 Uh-huh.

910
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:12,940
 Shit, now I'm trying to think of a different movie title with the name of the person in there to make a joke about it.

911
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:17,740
 But now I can't even think of the movie title that I want to make a joke about.

912
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:22,640
 So now the show is really just ground to a halt.

913
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,240
 It was the Dustin Hoffman movie where he dresses up like a woman for most of the movie.

914
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,140
 Tootsie, that's it. That's the movie I was going to make a joke about.

915
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,840
 So now we've gotten to that part.

916
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,040
 So now getting back to the original question.

917
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,840
 I still don't know and I can't pass.

918
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,140
 Shit.

919
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:40,640
 Tootsie 2.

920
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,540
 Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters.

921
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,640
 Tootsie 2.

922
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,640
 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

923
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,340
 Dan Aykroyd is a kid?

924
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,740
 Dan Aykroyd was in that?

925
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,740
 Yes, he's a guy.

926
01:03:53,740 --> 01:04:00,840
 He arranges the flight out of town.

927
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,040
 Yeah, he's in the airport scene.

928
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,840
 Huh, all right.

929
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,040
 Paul, you're up.

930
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:13,940
 I'll do 80 Sci-Fi for 400.

931
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:22,240
 Janet Davis still loved Jeff Goldblum even after he turned into a giant slimy booger and started vomiting on his food and climbing the walls.

932
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,240
 So beautiful.

933
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,040
 The fly.

934
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,140
 The fly is of course correct.

935
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:29,940
 Good stuff.

936
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,140
 Also, I would have accepted Earth Girls Are Easy.

937
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:32,640
 Oh, yes.

938
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,940
 Earth Girls Are Easy.

939
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,240
 Matt.

940
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,440
 80's Action 800.

941
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,140
 Remember when Dirty Dancing ripped out that guy's throat?

942
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:46,040
 That was awesome.

943
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,140
 Roadhouse.

944
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,040
 Roadhouse, baby.

945
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,540
 Roadhouse.

946
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:56,240
 Driving me Swayze.

947
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,940
 I'll take Sci-Fi from Paul.

948
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,940
 200.

949
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,340
 It's the other day.

950
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:02,940
 It doesn't matter.

951
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,340
 He was just going to get it right anyway.

952
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:09,040
 Harrison Ford stands around a bunker while tiny forest bears dismantle an intergalactic army.

953
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:16,140
 Then the bears dance at a time traveling Hayden Christensen ghost does a creepy smile right into the camera.

954
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,940
 Does he ever?

955
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:23,240
 That would be the first act I think of Empire, right?

956
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,640
 And that's Empire Strikes Back.

957
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,840
 Empire Strikes Back.

958
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,440
 Pretty sure that's Empire Strikes Back.

959
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,040
 It's Jedi.

960
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,040
 It's Return of the Jedi.

961
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,740
 I know what it is.

962
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,040
 Star Wars 7 or 12 or something.

963
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,240
 Exactly.

964
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,940
 Exactly where I am with the hot franchise now.

965
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,940
 Oh, that was something I was going to say right at the top of the show that just jarred it out of me.

966
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:49,740
 I am extremely disappointed that Lucas couldn't make the prequels more compelling because in

967
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:55,240
 essence the lesson there is a valuable one that is terribly applicable to what's going

968
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,640
 on right now.

969
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,940
 It's just wrapped up in the worst storytelling and filmmaking.

970
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:07,540
 It's just so bad, but it is very prescient and necessary lessons to be learned.

971
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,340
 It's funny.

972
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,940
 What's the name of the show that's on Disney+ right now that got nominated for awards?

973
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,840
 Andor.

974
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,740
 Yeah, the guy who was out front protesting.

975
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,940
 Yeah, protesting in front of Disney because you really have a show on the air about this right now.

976
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,340
 Did you even watch Andor?

977
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,240
 Yeah, exactly.

978
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,340
 Yep.

979
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,540
 Yeah, it's pretty great.

980
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,440
 Pretty crazy.

981
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,040
 Well, I mean, that's the ultimate goal, right?

982
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,840
 Repackage your descent and feed it to you as a product.

983
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,240
 All right.

984
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,640
 Let's go with 80s horror for 200, please.

985
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,840
 Yeah, let's do that.

986
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,640
 A mother took revenge on the staff of this camp in the 1950s and again in the 1980s for

987
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,940
 the drowning of her son.

988
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,840
 Oh, yeah, I think maybe later he might have killed some people or something too.

989
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
 Friday the 13th.

990
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,840
 Friday the 13th.

991
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,440
 Jason Ford, his mom.

992
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
 Oh, this camp.

993
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
 Oh, no.

994
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,840
 Oh, it's the camp.

995
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,440
 Camp Crystal Lake.

996
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,140
 Oh, we misread the question.

997
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:57,640
 I missed it.

998
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,240
 I missed it.

999
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:58,940
 I did too.

1000
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,840
 I did too.

1001
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,740
 Camp Crystal Lake was the answer for those who was right.

1002
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,040
 Matt.

1003
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,140
 Now's my chance to seize the lead.

1004
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,640
 Oh, you're close?

1005
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,440
 I will take 80s comedies for 400.

1006
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,340
 You guys are growing up so fast.

1007
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,040
 I hardly recognize you anymore.

1008
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:21,940
 Name any two actors to play either of the Griswold children in any of the 80s first three

1009
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,240
 vacation films.

1010
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,340
 Oh, geez.

1011
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,240
 Anthony Michael Hall.

1012
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:26,840
 There's one.

1013
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,040
 Yeah.

1014
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,040
 Boy, that's it for me.

1015
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,640
 That's the one that I knew too.

1016
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,340
 Pass it to me.

1017
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,640
 All right, I'll pass.

1018
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,540
 Passes to me.

1019
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:46,740
 I'm going to say Anthony Michael Hall and I will pass to Paul.

1020
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:51,740
 Anthony Michael Hall, Jonathan Glowacki.

1021
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:59,840
 What's her name from the fucking thing?

1022
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,740
 That's literally the question.

1023
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,240
 I know.

1024
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,240
 That's literally what the question is.

1025
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,240
 Juliette Lewis.

1026
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,240
 Juliette Lewis.

1027
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,240
 Juliette Louise Dreyfus.

1028
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
 No, just Juliette Lewis.

1029
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,240
 All right, there we go.

1030
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:19,140
 Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Barron, Jason Lively, Dana Hill, Johnny Galecki, and Juliette Lewis.

1031
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,040
 I had such a crush on Dana Barron as a kid.

1032
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,440
 She did a bunch of like.

1033
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,840
 Which one was Dana Barron?

1034
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
 She's the.

1035
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
 Which one was she in?

1036
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,240
 Sister in the first one.

1037
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,240
 Okay.

1038
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,240
 Let's see.

1039
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,240
 It's me.

1040
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,240
 I'll try 80s.

1041
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,240
 Comedy.

1042
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,240
 Who cares?

1043
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,240
 I'm losing 600.

1044
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,240
 This legendary director has poked fun at numerous blockbusters, genres, and historical dictators

1045
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,240
 at 99 years young.

1046
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,240
 If he's still alive at all by the time this is read, he's made 11 films over three decades,

1047
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,240
 but only two in the 80s.

1048
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:59,240
 Name him and one of those two films.

1049
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,360
 What's the name of that movie?

1050
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,480
 Is it The Great Dictator?

1051
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,520
 I think it's Charlie Chaplin and The Great Dictator.

1052
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,520
 No, he's, he's long dead.

1053
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,520
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

1054
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,240
 You're, you're, you're, you're down the wrong path there, bud.

1055
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,240
 Yeah.

1056
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,240
 Wait, is this not?

1057
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,240
 Okay.

1058
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,240
 This guy's still alive.

1059
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,240
 I thought this was saying.

1060
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,240
 Oh, sorry.

1061
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,240
 I misread that.

1062
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,200
 I thought this was saying he was 99 years old in the 80s.

1063
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,440
 He's still alive right now.

1064
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,440
 No, no.

1065
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,440
 Ah, okay.

1066
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:33,600
 So in that case, Charlie Chaplin, Oh, what is, Oh, this has to be, uh, uh, Mel Brooks.

1067
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,600
 Yeah.

1068
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,600
 There you go.

1069
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:41,560
 And then, uh, two films in the eighties, men's heights in the eighties.

1070
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,920
 I don't think men and tights wasn't the eighties.

1071
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,360
 If it was in the eighties, it was like 89, but I don't think so.

1072
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,360
 Yeah.

1073
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:52,200
 I think, I think men's heights was nineties, uh, star wars, uh, star wars, uh, space balls.

1074
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,200
 There you go.

1075
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,200
 Yeah.

1076
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,200
 I don't think that's safe.

1077
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,200
 Yeah.

1078
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,200
 Mel Brooks, history of the world.

1079
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,200
 Part one and space balls.

1080
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,200
 There we go.

1081
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
 Paul.

1082
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
 Eighties horror.

1083
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
 Man, I misread that.

1084
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,200
 Uh, that question entirely.

1085
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,200
 Yeah.

1086
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
 Yeah.

1087
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
 Yeah.

1088
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,200
 It's a lot of words.

1089
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,200
 Yeah.

1090
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,960
 Uh, 400 eighties or this eighties film franchise about spooky hauntings was said to be cursed

1091
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,920
 after cast and crew members of each one died during or soon after making each film.

1092
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,160
 Sadly, this ended with the death of the main star of the series at the young age of only

1093
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,160
 12.

1094
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:44,840
 Oh, um, oh man, is it, I think it's twilight zone, um, but I've got to pass cause I'm not

1095
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,120
 sure it was twilight zone.

1096
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,120
 Matt.

1097
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,280
 I will also pass Jacob.

1098
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,520
 That passes to me.

1099
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,560
 I think it's the Omen.

1100
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,560
 No.

1101
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,520
 Well, I've already guessed.

1102
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,520
 I'm guessing the Omen.

1103
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,200
 Oh, it's poltergeist.

1104
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,760
 Oh, the poltergeist films.

1105
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,760
 Okay.

1106
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,600
 It was that girl, but that girl died in the twilight zone movie.

1107
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,840
 She didn't die in the poltergeist.

1108
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
 The little, yeah.

1109
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,680
 The little girl died from the, from the twilight zone movie.

1110
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,720
 Guys, Drew Barrymore is still alive.

1111
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,280
 Ah, thank goodness.

1112
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,280
 What about Charlie chaplain?

1113
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,280
 What's your source?

1114
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,280
 Matt.

1115
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,160
 Uh, eighties comedies, 800 please.

1116
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:25,560
 Despite starring in a combined plethora of beloved comedies, often with no numerous of

1117
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,440
 their revered contemporaries, these two eighties comedic actors have only shared a few minutes

1118
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,840
 together in a film musical adaptation of a Richard Corman movie.

1119
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,840
 Roger Corman.

1120
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,840
 Hmm.

1121
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,840
 Oh, excuse me.

1122
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,840
 Roger Corman.

1123
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,640
 I think, wait, hold on.

1124
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,440
 I'm trying to really dissect this question.

1125
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,440
 Yeah.

1126
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,320
 That being a combined plethora of beloved movies, often with numerous other revered contemporaries,

1127
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,240
 these two eighties comedic actors only shared a few minutes together.

1128
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,880
 There is, there is a big hint in the question as well.

1129
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,480
 Well, plethora, right?

1130
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,480
 Yeah.

1131
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,320
 That's from the three amigos.

1132
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,520
 Uh huh.

1133
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:09,880
 So there's Chevy chase, but they, but they shared a movie together.

1134
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,400
 I'm so confused.

1135
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:18,640
 I have the, I have the Chevy chase or I have the three amigos part.

1136
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,640
 Right?

1137
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:27,040
 These two eighties comedic actors have only shared a few minutes together in a film.

1138
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,320
 Oh, I don't know.

1139
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,080
 I don't understand because they were together in three amigos, so I can't, it's not them,

1140
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,080
 right?

1141
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,080
 It's not.

1142
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,680
 It's not the one of the other two amigos probably.

1143
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,680
 Right.

1144
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,080
 Oh, I, I know who it is.

1145
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,080
 Okay.

1146
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
 I'm pretty sure.

1147
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
 I'm pretty sure.

1148
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,080
 Okay.

1149
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
 I'll pass.

1150
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,080
 Think of who else was in three amigos.

1151
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,080
 Yeah.

1152
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,080
 No, it passes to me.

1153
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,360
 I think it's just Steve Martin and Martin Short.

1154
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,200
 No, I don't think so.

1155
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,200
 You don't think it is?

1156
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,540
 No, because they're in it for the long haul.

1157
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:04,220
 There was another cameo, another SNL cameo early in that movie.

1158
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,220
 Very brief.

1159
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,840
 Oh, the coyote that sings.

1160
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,840
 Nope.

1161
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
 Gumbi?

1162
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,840
 I pass.

1163
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,840
 Paul.

1164
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,840
 How much is this one for?

1165
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,840
 I have no idea.

1166
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
 Come on, Paul.

1167
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,840
 I'm going to go for it.

1168
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:31,020
 I'm going to say, oh no, I don't know, but I think the other one is John Lovitz, but

1169
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,020
 I don't know who the other one is.

1170
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:39,200
 Boy, I think we should maybe go back and erase the A block of this episode.

1171
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
 Well, now I'm not sure.

1172
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,580
 Extend this for another half hour and I'm not sure who the other one was.

1173
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:47,440
 I'm just going to reorder it, Matt.

1174
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
 So this is first.

1175
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,440
 Paul, neither did I.

1176
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,440
 That's why I passed.

1177
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,440
 I know, but I really don't know.

1178
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,440
 Neither did Matt.

1179
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,440
 All right.

1180
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,440
 I thought I knew it.

1181
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,440
 You talked me out of it.

1182
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,440
 All right.

1183
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
 Go ahead.

1184
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
 I don't know.

1185
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,440
 So you're passing after all that?

1186
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
 Yeah.

1187
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:09,360
 Holy shit, Steve Martin and Bill Murray in Little Shop of Horrors.

1188
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,480
 Oh, okay.

1189
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,440
 Steve Martin and Bill Murray.

1190
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,280
 I really want to mark that as Paul got it wrong.

1191
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,160
 After all that time, I really want to mark that as Paul got it wrong.

1192
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,160
 I did get it wrong.

1193
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,040
 If I had guessed, I'd have been fucked.

1194
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
 That's me.

1195
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,040
 I'll try.

1196
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,040
 Let's see.

1197
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,040
 Scores are, I have zero points.

1198
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,040
 Matt has 1,400.

1199
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,040
 Paul is winning with 2,000.

1200
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,800
 I'll just take the $600 question.

1201
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,060
 There's a $600 to $800 question left.

1202
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:38,800
 Stephen King famously hated this film adaptation of one of his books, calling it a maddening,

1203
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,880
 perverse and disappointing film.

1204
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:48,680
 Then again, Stephen King did co-direct Maximum Overdrive with presumably a giant bag of cocaine.

1205
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,040
 I think the bag of cocaine did most of the heavy lifting on Maximum Overdrive.

1206
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,620
 I believe that is The Shining.

1207
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,740
 I think you're right.

1208
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,280
 It is The Shining.

1209
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,600
 Oh, funny.

1210
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,600
 He did not like that.

1211
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,720
 Paul, close it up the category and the game 80s Horror for 800.

1212
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,360
 This is for the win, baby.

1213
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:14,600
 Brad Durif plays a voodoo-wise serial killer inhabiting a redhead doll named Chucky who

1214
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,260
 befriends a young Chicago boy before trying to kill Jack Skellington and the mom from

1215
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,800
 Seventh Heaven.

1216
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,620
 What ironically named brand of doll is Chucky?

1217
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,680
 He's one of the good guys.

1218
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:32,460
 He's one of the good guys, absolutely.

1219
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,680
 And that is the game.

1220
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,920
 Paul wins on a question that Matt knew the answer to as well.

1221
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,920
 He has 2,800 points.

1222
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,100
 Matt has 1,400.

1223
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,600
 I have 600.

1224
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,760
 And that's from Keester Sunday.

1225
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,080
 Before you wrap up, Jacob, can we go back to that question about Steve Martin a little

1226
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,080
 more?

1227
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,080
 Good guy.

1228
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
 But it wasn't about Steve Martin.

1229
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
 It was just a, I don't know.

1230
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
 It was a tough one.

1231
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
 That was a tough question.

1232
01:15:53,080 --> 01:16:00,880
 Honestly, the toughest question we've ever gotten on this show, I think, just really

1233
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,880
 tough.

1234
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,880
 Definitely.

1235
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,880
 Just hard.

1236
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,200
 And honestly, the toughest topic that we tackled on this episode.

1237
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,320
 You guys, you SOBs.

1238
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:19,800
 You thought for so, you asked for it, then thought for so long about it, and then passed.

1239
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,800
 Well, you know what?

1240
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:27,720
 You guys told me it was about, you had convinced me it was about Three Amigos.

1241
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,720
 And that's the question that convinced you of that.

1242
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,600
 It wasn't about Three Amigos.

1243
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,600
 The clue.

1244
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,640
 It referenced Three Amigos, didn't it?

1245
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,640
 Steve Martin.

1246
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,100
 Yeah, it said Plethora.

1247
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:43,880
 I can't believe we actually are going back to talking about this question more.

1248
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,640
 It said Plethora as a hint to Steve Martin.

1249
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
 Oh, okay.

1250
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,640
 Yeah.

1251
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
 Jesus Christ.

1252
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,640
 Okay.

1253
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,640
 I want to think.

1254
01:16:51,640 --> 01:17:01,360
 I heard, I heard the episode where they got politicals, the one where they broke up, it's

1255
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,080
 like, even true, if you listen to the episode, it's not about the political stuff.

1256
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,080
 They didn't break up for the politics.

1257
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,080
 It's not the part that you think.

1258
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,760
 They broke up for a Steve Martin question.

1259
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,760
 Last episode, everybody.

1260
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,760
 Enjoy it.

1261
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,240
 Slow walk into the final app.

1262
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,240
 Jesus.

1263
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:24,240
 We have one more episode on Twitch and then we're doing the next two in person, right,

1264
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,240
 Paul?

1265
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,240
 That's right.

1266
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,240
 Because you can come out here Wednesday.

1267
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,240
 Yeah.

1268
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,240
 I'll be here Wednesday.

1269
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,240
 Wait.

1270
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,240
 We have another episode on Twitch?

1271
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,240
 I'll be there.

1272
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,240
 I'll be in late.

1273
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,240
 Oh, today's Friday, right?

1274
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,240
 Today's Friday.

1275
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,240
 Yeah.

1276
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,200
 I'll be in late Tuesday if we want to try and get another one.

1277
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,200
 I don't know.

1278
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,200
 You're coming in late Tuesday?

1279
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,200
 Yeah.

1280
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,040
 Oh, then yeah, I think we should definitely try and do one on Tuesday then.

1281
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,040
 Right.

1282
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,040
 Tuesday night?

1283
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,840
 Maybe we'll try and do it Tuesday night.

1284
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,840
 Yeah.

1285
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,840
 All right.

1286
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
 We'll figure it out.

1287
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
 Production meeting.

1288
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:02,840
 Let's do it on air.

1289
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,800
 So anyway, I think we should record a show on Thursday.

1290
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,800
 Professionals.

1291
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,600
 I want to thank Penn Jillette for creating this podcast.

1292
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
 Thanks, Penn.

1293
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,680
 And I can't, I have very mixed emotions about whether it's disappointing or actually quite

1294
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,080
 a relief that Penn's been in England for the last three weeks and we haven't done Penn

1295
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,080
 Sunday School about anything contemporary.

1296
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,800
 Oh, congratulations, by the way, to the Magic Circle in the UK for finally legitimizing themselves.

1297
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,800
 Yes.

1298
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,200
 Isn't that the fact?

1299
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,360
 That's exactly right.

1300
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
 The honor goes to them.

1301
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
 Good job, Magic Circle.

1302
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,680
 Penn and Teller have just honored them.

1303
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,680
 So the next episode of Penn Sunday School is going to be recorded at Scoop Fest.

1304
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,120
 Oh my God.

1305
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,360
 It's going to be insane.

1306
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,840
 And right after that is Piff, Piff is coming in to do the foolish breakdown of his trip

1307
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,400
 to Hong Kong.

1308
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,840
 Is Penn going to stick around for that?

1309
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,280
 The idea is that Penn stick around.

1310
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:58,160
 And then we also then we can get Piff on Penn Sunday School because Piff really read Penn

1311
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,360
 the Riot Act when Penn was bitching about not being in the Magic Circle.

1312
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,720
 Piff famously was like, they have one rule and you broke it.

1313
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,080
 I don't know why you're upset about it.

1314
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,080
 He's going to get rubbed in the face.

1315
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:20,480
 I'm looking in chat, no, Hondo will not be coming to Scoop Fest this year.

1316
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,280
 That was the whole being in Spain thing.

1317
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,280
 Yeah.

1318
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,720
 Although we are bringing in guests from another country this year.

1319
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,720
 That's true.

1320
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,720
 That's true.

1321
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,720
 That's a first.

1322
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
 It is.

1323
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,720

1325
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:39,440
 And we're not just talking about Texas, great night.

1326
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:45,360
 I want to thank the following people who also the video of their head exploding is more

1327
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,520
 famous than their movies.

1328
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,680
 That's John Holton, John Jacob Schuepelheimer Schmidt, Johnnie Parker.

1329
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,680

1330
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,680

 We got a store.

1484
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:23,120
 That was just a jingle that doesn't mean anything.

1485
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,440
 What's funny is that it's a wonderful gem.

1486
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,280
 It's one of my brother's favorite things.

1487
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,440
 He loves every time we play that, and it cracks me up too.

1488
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,000
 I'm authentically failing in it.

1489
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
 I think that's why.

1490
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,280
 I'm not purposely being lame.

1491
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,600
 I crash and burn, and I think that's what fuels it, I think.

1492
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,600
 It's gold.

1493
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,680
 Go check out store jingle.com.

1494
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,360
 There's some fun stuff over there.

1495
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,360
 A lot of people have.

1496
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,800
 A lot of people have shopped up.

1497
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,840
 We got our share from the site, and I was like, "Oh, a lot of people boning up for Scoop

1498
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,840
 Fest, I think."

1499
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,840
 Yeah.

1500
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,840
 That's great.

1501
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,840
 Thank you for buying our merch.

1502
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,840
 I just like that they're boning up.

1503
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,840
 We appreciate the support.

1504
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,440
 Well, that coexist skull is doing numbers, I'm betting.

1505
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,440
 It is.

1506
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,440
 It is.

1507
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,000
 The coexist-to-punish-your-enemy skull shirt is pretty great.

1508
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,600
 It's the Punisher skull that you see everywhere on the backs of pickup trucks and on t-shirts

1509
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:18,080
 and everything, but it's that with the ... Oh, I never remember the name of the flag.

1510
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:23,720
 The full ... Not just the pride flag anymore, but the full ... It's the Trans and Prides

1511
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,720
 right there.

1512
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,720
 Yeah, yeah.

1513
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,720
 It's all of the extra stuff tagged on with the pride flag and all.

1514
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,720
 It's great.

1515
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,520
 It's all of that within the Punisher skull.

1516
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,520
 It says coexist.

1517
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:39,080
 It's like the old coexist stickers with all the different religious iconography on there.

1518
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,080
 It's pretty good.

1519
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,080
 It's pretty good.

1520
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,080
 All right.

1521
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,980
 Now, the porn-themed hat did not disappear.

1522
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:50,000
 The porn-themed hat, if you just click on porn is good for you, you can select it to

1523
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
 be printed on a hat.

1524
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,560
 You can also select hats.

1525
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,560
 Okay.

1526
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,560
 There you go.

1527
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,560
 All right.

1528
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,560
 Well, thanks for listening, everybody.

1529
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,560
 Stay safe out there.

1530
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,560
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

1531
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:58,560
 We'll see you soon.

1532
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:31,560
 be safe.

1533
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,560
 Love you.

1534
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,560
 See you.

1535
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:33,560
 Bye.
