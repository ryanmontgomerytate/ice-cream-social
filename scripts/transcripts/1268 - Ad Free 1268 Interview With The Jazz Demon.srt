1
0:00:03 --> 0:00:06
Oh, hello there, I am so happy you're here

2
0:00:06 --> 0:00:09
because I wanna thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

3
0:00:09 --> 0:00:11
Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

4
0:00:11 --> 0:00:13
It's a new month, we don't have a new list yet.

5
0:00:13 --> 0:00:15
Happy December, by the way,

6
0:00:15 --> 0:00:18
but we won't thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver

7
0:00:18 --> 0:00:19
at this part of a future show.

8
0:00:20 --> 0:00:23
I met the lost Ice Cream Truck Driver last night.

9
0:00:23 --> 0:00:25
She came to the show and introduced herself

10
0:00:25 --> 0:00:25
to me personally.

11
0:00:26 --> 0:00:28
I was so happy to meet an Ice Cream Truck Driver.

12
0:00:29 --> 0:00:31
If you wanna meet an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

13
0:00:31 --> 0:00:32
if you wanna be an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

14
0:00:32 --> 0:00:34
if you wanna meet one, it's easier.

15
0:00:34 --> 0:00:36
But if you wanna be one, preachyfun.com,

16
0:00:37 --> 0:00:38
preachyfun.com is where you can go to sign up

17
0:00:38 --> 0:00:40
to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows?

18
0:00:41 --> 0:00:44
The life you save may be your own.

19
0:00:48 --> 0:00:49
Ow, it's a show.

20
0:00:49 --> 0:00:52
Hey Johnny, you wanna go to an Ice Cream Social?

21
0:00:53 --> 0:00:54
Yeah, I'd love to.

22
0:00:54 --> 0:00:56
Great, let's go.

23
0:01:00 --> 0:01:03
Mike Jones is here, the jazz demon.

24
0:01:03 --> 0:01:04
I am.

25
0:01:14 --> 0:01:16
It's time for Matt Manley's Ice Cream Social,

26
0:01:16 --> 0:01:18
sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly.

27
0:01:19 --> 0:01:21
Sitting at sea, it's Matt Donnelly.

28
0:01:21 --> 0:01:23
In Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob, the audio guy.

29
0:01:23 --> 0:01:24
We're preaching fun.

30
0:01:24 --> 0:01:25
We're preaching fun.

31
0:01:26 --> 0:01:27
Greetings from the ocean.

32
0:01:28 --> 0:01:28
Yes.

33
0:01:29 --> 0:01:29
Ahoy.

34
0:01:30 --> 0:01:30
Ahoy indeed.

35
0:01:31 --> 0:01:33
Mike, do people still call you the jazz demon?

36
0:01:33 --> 0:01:35
And when did first people start calling you that?

37
0:01:36 --> 0:01:38
It was as a small child.

38
0:01:40 --> 0:01:42
It was on my second birthday.

39
0:01:43 --> 0:01:44
It was a rainy evening.

40
0:01:44 --> 0:01:47
It was after the second conviction for arson.

41
0:01:51 --> 0:01:54
No, of course that was, I believe that was,

42
0:01:54 --> 0:01:57
Zeke Zabrowski from the Penn and Teller show

43
0:01:57 --> 0:01:58
back when he was a young child.

44
0:01:59 --> 0:02:02
He started calling me the jazz demon very early on

45
0:02:02 --> 0:02:05
in my career with Penn and Teller,

46
0:02:05 --> 0:02:07
and Penn latched onto it

47
0:02:07 --> 0:02:09
and still uses it every night in the show.

48
0:02:11 --> 0:02:13
And I have a jazz demon license plate.

49
0:02:14 --> 0:02:15
So I can't get rid of it now.

50
0:02:15 --> 0:02:17
Oh, yeah, you're stuck with it now.

51
0:02:17 --> 0:02:19
Oh, it's more, it's more horrific than that

52
0:02:19 --> 0:02:23
because you can only use how many, whatever, seven letters.

53
0:02:24 --> 0:02:28
So I decided to use J-A-Z-Z-D-M-N

54
0:02:29 --> 0:02:34
because I thought J-Z-Z-D-M-O-N might be

55
0:02:34 --> 0:02:39
a different connotation, not on a B, G-S-D-N-O.

56
0:02:39 --> 0:02:41
So I went with jazz demon,

57
0:02:41 --> 0:02:43
but then I get these people to say,

58
0:02:43 --> 0:02:45
jazz demand, what does that mean?

59
0:02:47 --> 0:02:49
And so I just ignore people.

60
0:02:49 --> 0:02:51
Do people stop you and talk to you

61
0:02:51 --> 0:02:52
about your license plate all the time?

62
0:02:52 --> 0:02:54
I feel like this is something that happens in Las Vegas,

63
0:02:54 --> 0:02:56
is people discuss other people's license plates.

64
0:02:57 --> 0:02:58
Yeah, it's happened more than once,

65
0:02:59 --> 0:03:00
which is one time too many.

66
0:03:01 --> 0:03:03
No, it's fine.

67
0:03:04 --> 0:03:06
It bothers me when I come up behind people

68
0:03:06 --> 0:03:08
and I can't figure out what their plate's supposed to mean.

69
0:03:10 --> 0:03:13
It always means jizz on my penis, that's what it means.

70
0:03:13 --> 0:03:14
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

71
0:03:16 --> 0:03:18
But it's been, yeah, it's been 25 years.

72
0:03:19 --> 0:03:22
I don't use it myself, you know,

73
0:03:22 --> 0:03:23
hey, how you doing?

74
0:03:23 --> 0:03:24
I'm the jazz demon.

75
0:03:25 --> 0:03:27
Never introduced myself that way.

76
0:03:27 --> 0:03:34
However, I'm not offended when others refer to me as that,

77
0:03:34 --> 0:03:39
but yeah, it's been, but Zeke came up with that

78
0:03:39 --> 0:03:41
because you know, metal, right?

79
0:03:41 --> 0:03:45
I guess more metal is better.

80
0:03:46 --> 0:03:49
He keeps wanting me to start the piano on fire

81
0:03:49 --> 0:03:54
and play a lot of metal music, but I won't do it.

82
0:03:54 --> 0:03:54
Great balls of fire.

83
0:03:55 --> 0:03:59
No, no, he wants like, I don't know, mega death.

84
0:03:59 --> 0:04:02
He wants some mega death covers with the piano burning.

85
0:04:03 --> 0:04:05
I think that'd be a fun new addition

86
0:04:05 --> 0:04:07
to the pre-show at Penn & Teller.

87
0:04:07 --> 0:04:09
Don't give them any ideas.

88
0:04:09 --> 0:04:11
Have you ever played any kind of stunt piano

89
0:04:11 --> 0:04:13
for any kind of gig?

90
0:04:13 --> 0:04:16
I have not, luckily.

91
0:04:17 --> 0:04:21
I mean, in my youth, I would do my Jerry Lee Lewis

92
0:04:21 --> 0:04:23
impersonation and hit the piano with my feet

93
0:04:23 --> 0:04:25
and stuff like that.

94
0:04:26 --> 0:04:30
But no, I try to respect the instrument.

95
0:04:32 --> 0:04:37
You know, when I would play in like lounges

96
0:04:39 --> 0:04:42
and some asshole would set his drink on the piano

97
0:04:42 --> 0:04:44
right in front of me while I'm playing a song,

98
0:04:44 --> 0:04:47
I would scream, it's not furniture, asshole.

99
0:04:48 --> 0:04:48
You know?

100
0:04:48 --> 0:04:50
You want to set your drink on somebody's violin?

101
0:04:51 --> 0:04:52
Really smart, thanks.

102
0:04:53 --> 0:04:55
But, and that got me a lot of tips, you know?

103
0:04:55 --> 0:04:56
That's why I was so successful.

104
0:04:59 --> 0:05:00
Hey, could you play some Billy Joe?

105
0:05:00 --> 0:05:01
Why don't you fuck off?

106
0:05:01 --> 0:05:02
No.

107
0:05:05 --> 0:05:06
Our piano player here is great.

108
0:05:07 --> 0:05:10
He takes requests, but only the requests he wants to take.

109
0:05:10 --> 0:05:10
Exactly.

110
0:05:11 --> 0:05:14
Our musical director, Mike, at the Second City,

111
0:05:15 --> 0:05:17
he, you know, they had a piano that was there

112
0:05:17 --> 0:05:19
on the stage all the time.

113
0:05:19 --> 0:05:22
And this was when we were sharing the stage

114
0:05:22 --> 0:05:23
with the expert-less dancers.

115
0:05:24 --> 0:05:26
So they would come in and do the show late night

116
0:05:26 --> 0:05:27
after we were done.

117
0:05:27 --> 0:05:29
And there was one day we came in for rehearsal

118
0:05:30 --> 0:05:33
and there was an unmistakable coochie print

119
0:05:33 --> 0:05:38
right on the piano top that you just couldn't get away from.

120
0:05:38 --> 0:05:40
And we all just spent the day kind of oogling it.

121
0:05:40 --> 0:05:42
Mike just kind of had to play around it.

122
0:05:42 --> 0:05:43
Oogling it.

123
0:05:44 --> 0:05:45
You didn't clean it?

124
0:05:45 --> 0:05:46
No, we didn't clean it.

125
0:05:46 --> 0:05:48
You didn't go get some fucking furniture spray.

126
0:05:48 --> 0:05:50
Man, it's like Jesus' face in a piece of toast

127
0:05:50 --> 0:05:52
or something, you don't fucking have that shit.

128
0:05:53 --> 0:05:56
You guys just kept taking turns blindfolding each other,

129
0:05:56 --> 0:05:58
playing pin the clip on the pussy.

130
0:05:58 --> 0:06:00
And you just kind of just go around and see if you can.

131
0:06:01 --> 0:06:03
Yeah, so there's definitely lots of respect

132
0:06:03 --> 0:06:05
for the instrument out here in Las Vegas.

133
0:06:05 --> 0:06:06
Yeah, yeah.

134
0:06:06 --> 0:06:08
I had a bit of a reputation

135
0:06:08 --> 0:06:10
because many, many years ago,

136
0:06:10 --> 0:06:12
this is way before the internet times,

137
0:06:13 --> 0:06:15
there was a cartoon in the New Yorker

138
0:06:15 --> 0:06:18
that showed a guy playing like cocktail piano.

139
0:06:18 --> 0:06:20
And it's in the caption underneath was,

140
0:06:21 --> 0:06:22
you people make me sick.

141
0:06:22 --> 0:06:25
Nevertheless, here's another toe tapper.

142
0:06:26 --> 0:06:27
There it is.

143
0:06:28 --> 0:06:28
That's great.

144
0:06:29 --> 0:06:32
A bunch of people, I got like seven copies of that

145
0:06:32 --> 0:06:33
in the mail to me.

146
0:06:34 --> 0:06:34
Sure.

147
0:06:34 --> 0:06:36
So I guess I had a reputation.

148
0:06:36 --> 0:06:39
Friends know you, I'm suffering a bad.

149
0:06:39 --> 0:06:40
Now at this point,

150
0:06:41 --> 0:06:42
you've been with the Penn and Teller show

151
0:06:42 --> 0:06:44
for quite a while.

152
0:06:44 --> 0:06:46
There have been many different iterations

153
0:06:46 --> 0:06:48
of the stage there.

154
0:06:48 --> 0:06:51
Have you ever considered talking them into

155
0:06:51 --> 0:06:54
maybe having a Batman like secret two key press

156
0:06:54 --> 0:06:57
that would then sink your piano into the stage

157
0:06:57 --> 0:06:59
or open up a secret window?

158
0:06:59 --> 0:07:00
Yeah.

159
0:07:00 --> 0:07:01
Teller has been talking for years

160
0:07:01 --> 0:07:05
about wanting to make the piano float somehow

161
0:07:05 --> 0:07:06
over the stage.

162
0:07:07 --> 0:07:10
I think hopefully they've gotten that out of there

163
0:07:10 --> 0:07:11
that's passed them by.

164
0:07:13 --> 0:07:15
But I think they were,

165
0:07:15 --> 0:07:17
I'm hoping they'll age out of that idea.

166
0:07:18 --> 0:07:20
It's, I've been with them almost half their career now.

167
0:07:21 --> 0:07:23
25 years almost.

168
0:07:23 --> 0:07:28
And it's great about,

169
0:07:29 --> 0:07:30
I don't know, well, I'm bad with time now,

170
0:07:30 --> 0:07:32
but several years ago,

171
0:07:33 --> 0:07:36
they surprised me with a Mike Jones corner

172
0:07:36 --> 0:07:37
on the right side of the stage

173
0:07:37 --> 0:07:40
with the neon sign and the Mike Jones duo.

174
0:07:41 --> 0:07:44
And, but yeah, I'm happy with the piano staying.

175
0:07:45 --> 0:07:47
And also just from a practical standpoint,

176
0:07:47 --> 0:07:49
you can't.

177
0:07:49 --> 0:07:50
Whoa.

178
0:07:52 --> 0:07:53
That is very practical.

179
0:07:53 --> 0:07:55
Those are, that's our sound effect

180
0:07:55 --> 0:07:57
for telling you to get the fuck out of here, Mike.

181
0:07:58 --> 0:07:59
Take your directions and go.

182
0:07:59 --> 0:08:01
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

183
0:08:03 --> 0:08:04
Technical issues on our side.

184
0:08:05 --> 0:08:07
So yeah, you had the surprise of the reveal

185
0:08:07 --> 0:08:10
of the corner there dedicated to you.

186
0:08:11 --> 0:08:12
Yeah, that was nice.

187
0:08:12 --> 0:08:16
But I don't think you really should move a piano often

188
0:08:16 --> 0:08:18
because it's...

189
0:08:18 --> 0:08:18
I try not to.

190
0:08:19 --> 0:08:22
Yeah, well, they're heavy and also they go out of tune.

191
0:08:23 --> 0:08:23
I didn't think about that.

192
0:08:23 --> 0:08:28
But I think the teller's idea may be more in line

193
0:08:28 --> 0:08:33
with having a car appear on stage, you know what I mean?

194
0:08:34 --> 0:08:37
So I leave that up to them.

195
0:08:38 --> 0:08:40
But I'll play wherever they put me.

196
0:08:40 --> 0:08:43
When I, I've been doing these 50th anniversary gigs

197
0:08:43 --> 0:08:45
with them and it's been really fun.

198
0:08:46 --> 0:08:48
And we were doing Boston a couple of weeks ago

199
0:08:48 --> 0:08:51
and Glenn said, what if we put you up in one of the boxes?

200
0:08:51 --> 0:08:54
And I said, well, I'd sort of prefer to be on the stage.

201
0:08:56 --> 0:08:57
I felt like, okay.

202
0:08:58 --> 0:09:00
And so they made it work, but it was great.

203
0:09:00 --> 0:09:02
But, you know, there are, there are shows,

204
0:09:02 --> 0:09:05
as you guys know, many, many shows now,

205
0:09:05 --> 0:09:09
the orchestra is not in the same theater as the performance.

206
0:09:10 --> 0:09:11
They're in a, you know, they're in a basement

207
0:09:11 --> 0:09:14
somewhere and I, you know, and it's,

208
0:09:14 --> 0:09:19
I sort of draw the line there, you know?

209
0:09:19 --> 0:09:20
If I'm appearing with Ben and Tyler,

210
0:09:20 --> 0:09:21
I'd like to be in the same building.

211
0:09:23 --> 0:09:25
I'm often disappointed when I find that the orchestra

212
0:09:25 --> 0:09:27
is in a different space, like in a room next door.

213
0:09:28 --> 0:09:30
Yeah, it's, the first time I came across that

214
0:09:30 --> 0:09:32
was many years ago, there was a puppet show,

215
0:09:33 --> 0:09:36
Avenue Q, I think it was, at the Wynn.

216
0:09:37 --> 0:09:38
And I went to it and they're like,

217
0:09:39 --> 0:09:41
and look out up on the TV, there's our guys

218
0:09:41 --> 0:09:43
in a suite four, you know, four floors away.

219
0:09:43 --> 0:09:45
And I was like, oh, that's kind of a rip-off.

220
0:09:46 --> 0:09:47
And I was crazy too, because in that room

221
0:09:47 --> 0:09:50
we had an orchestra pit, we just didn't use it

222
0:09:50 --> 0:09:50
for Avenue Q.

223
0:09:53 --> 0:09:54
Too good for them.

224
0:09:54 --> 0:09:54
That's right.

225
0:09:55 --> 0:09:55
That's right.

226
0:09:55 --> 0:09:56
That's weird.

227
0:09:57 --> 0:09:58
For Spamalot, right after Avenue Q,

228
0:09:58 --> 0:10:01
we had like 28 orchestra members

229
0:10:01 --> 0:10:03
down in the, in the orchestra pit right there.

230
0:10:03 --> 0:10:05
I don't know why it didn't get used for Avenue Q.

231
0:10:06 --> 0:10:08
Yeah, they, they name it an orchestra pit

232
0:10:08 --> 0:10:12
because there's an orchestra in it, you know?

233
0:10:12 --> 0:10:13
But I don't want to put you in a suite

234
0:10:13 --> 0:10:14
and keep you away from people.

235
0:10:15 --> 0:10:18
You don't want to be in allusions with pianos.

236
0:10:18 --> 0:10:20
What allusions do you want to be a part of, Mike?

237
0:10:21 --> 0:10:22
All of them.

238
0:10:24 --> 0:10:25
I'll do anything.

239
0:10:25 --> 0:10:28
Can we get you in Georgie's Queen of Hearts dress

240
0:10:28 --> 0:10:29
for the, for that one bit?

241
0:10:30 --> 0:10:30
Can we get you in the picture?

242
0:10:30 --> 0:10:33
Yeah, yeah, I, you know, I, I, it's funny.

243
0:10:33 --> 0:10:35
Someone just asked me last night at the show,

244
0:10:36 --> 0:10:38
are you part of any of the tricks?

245
0:10:39 --> 0:10:41
And I don't think that there's,

246
0:10:41 --> 0:10:45
there's never been a trick that I've been a part of

247
0:10:45 --> 0:10:47
except for doing all the music.

248
0:10:47 --> 0:10:49
And I mean, and also the girl, the gorilla

249
0:10:50 --> 0:10:52
where I did the narration, which was actually fun,

250
0:10:52 --> 0:10:55
which I had like a whole thing alive, alive, alive.

251
0:10:55 --> 0:10:56
You know, and on the inside,

252
0:10:57 --> 0:10:58
Zomofo, the gorilla girl.

253
0:10:59 --> 0:11:00
And I did a whole carnival barking thing

254
0:11:00 --> 0:11:02
while I played like silent movie music.

255
0:11:03 --> 0:11:06
But mostly, I mean, and air sacs.

256
0:11:06 --> 0:11:08
I mean, we were, I was in center stage for that

257
0:11:08 --> 0:11:08
with Brian.

258
0:11:09 --> 0:11:12
But yeah, but I mean, they're not asking me to, you know,

259
0:11:13 --> 0:11:17
do any tricky shuffling or, hey, let's, you know,

260
0:11:18 --> 0:11:19
come on up for this trick.

261
0:11:19 --> 0:11:21
And let's let our piano player shuffle these cards.

262
0:11:23 --> 0:11:26
I think you would have made a really great ball pitch roll.

263
0:11:27 --> 0:11:30
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

264
0:11:30 --> 0:11:32
I remember that, that was a bit that was done.

265
0:11:32 --> 0:11:32
Oh, what?

266
0:11:33 --> 0:11:33
Twice?

267
0:11:35 --> 0:11:35
Twice, yeah.

268
0:11:36 --> 0:11:39
Well, it was not, it was, it was a teed up.

269
0:11:39 --> 0:11:41
If you see it on the Fula show, it's my son.

270
0:11:42 --> 0:11:43
Oh, I know, I was there.

271
0:11:44 --> 0:11:45
I was playing the ball control music.

272
0:11:46 --> 0:11:48
I'm also talking to the audience listening to our podcast.

273
0:11:49 --> 0:11:52
Oh, oh, oh, you have listeners?

274
0:11:56 --> 0:11:59
At minimum, the ones that are here now.

275
0:11:59 --> 0:12:00
I'm working on that.

276
0:12:02 --> 0:12:06
And we found it on the internet at the end of the day.

277
0:12:06 --> 0:12:07
And they're like, do they still do that bit?

278
0:12:07 --> 0:12:09
I was like, they never did that bit.

279
0:12:11 --> 0:12:12
This was it.

280
0:12:13 --> 0:12:15
I was like, you are the only ball pitch roll, buddy.

281
0:12:16 --> 0:12:19
Yeah, I think that there's only, I don't,

282
0:12:19 --> 0:12:21
there's not many tricks, not many bits

283
0:12:21 --> 0:12:24
that they've only done that limited amount of times,

284
0:12:24 --> 0:12:25
except for stuff that they did,

285
0:12:25 --> 0:12:27
especially for television.

286
0:12:27 --> 0:12:30
I think specifically it was done the year before COVID.

287
0:12:31 --> 0:12:35
So their ambition for it was to do it in the summertime

288
0:12:35 --> 0:12:37
where they got more families visiting.

289
0:12:37 --> 0:12:37
Yeah, I remember.

290
0:12:38 --> 0:12:40
They were actually going to recruit a kid each show

291
0:12:40 --> 0:12:41
before it happened.

292
0:12:41 --> 0:12:42
And then COVID happened,

293
0:12:42 --> 0:12:44
and then three seasons of Fula's happened.

294
0:12:44 --> 0:12:45
So by the time the show came back,

295
0:12:45 --> 0:12:47
they weren't like, let's dust off that old chestnut.

296
0:12:47 --> 0:12:49
Yeah, that's in one of our videos.

297
0:12:49 --> 0:12:49
I was like, I'm back in there.

298
0:12:49 --> 0:12:52
You know, and the crew loves it.

299
0:12:54 --> 0:12:54
Yeah.

300
0:12:54 --> 0:12:58
Cleaning up all those balls and setting up the perimeter

301
0:12:58 --> 0:13:01
and getting a kid to do magic.

302
0:13:01 --> 0:13:02
Yeah.

303
0:13:03 --> 0:13:04
I want to ask about it.

304
0:13:04 --> 0:13:06
He's like, oh, I would love to have done it again.

305
0:13:07 --> 0:13:10
And he is now like two feet taller than he was when he did it.

306
0:13:10 --> 0:13:11
Right.

307
0:13:11 --> 0:13:13
You can't do it again, everybody.

308
0:13:13 --> 0:13:14
Get in the thing. Yeah.

309
0:13:14 --> 0:13:16
You're out. You are out.

310
0:13:16 --> 0:13:18
It's over. Yeah, it's over.

311
0:13:18 --> 0:13:19
That part of your life is done.

312
0:13:20 --> 0:13:24
Well, I, yeah, I walked by a couple of months ago.

313
0:13:24 --> 0:13:25
I walked by Robbie Living,

314
0:13:25 --> 0:13:28
like after the end of Haystack,

315
0:13:28 --> 0:13:31
and he's like, you know, sweeping the hay up.

316
0:13:31 --> 0:13:34
And I said, the glamour of showbiz, you know,

317
0:13:35 --> 0:13:37
like he's, you know, picking up piles of hay

318
0:13:37 --> 0:13:39
and pulling cards out of it, you know.

319
0:13:41 --> 0:13:43
But there's a lot of...

320
0:13:43 --> 0:13:47
Tell us the story to Jessica Jane and I.

321
0:13:48 --> 0:13:49
He was talking about they were working on Broadway

322
0:13:50 --> 0:13:53
and he had like a boil on like the inside of his thigh or whatever.

323
0:13:53 --> 0:13:56
And it was, his costume was irritating him,

324
0:13:56 --> 0:13:59
especially after they did water tank or something.

325
0:13:59 --> 0:14:00
So he's doing a change.

326
0:14:00 --> 0:14:04
They said they had this flamboyant customer on Broadway

327
0:14:04 --> 0:14:07
who basically had to help tell her pop the boil.

328
0:14:07 --> 0:14:08
Oh, boy.

329
0:14:09 --> 0:14:09
Yeah.

330
0:14:10 --> 0:14:11
And he said he just looked at the teller.

331
0:14:11 --> 0:14:15
Dressers and wardrobe people on Broadway go above and beyond.

332
0:14:15 --> 0:14:17
Above and beyond, right?

333
0:14:17 --> 0:14:20
And he said he just looked at the teller from down on his knees

334
0:14:20 --> 0:14:23
going, ah, showbiz, the tinsel in the glamour.

335
0:14:27 --> 0:14:28
That's disgusting.

336
0:14:28 --> 0:14:32
Oh, yeah, the glamour made me laugh so hard.

337
0:14:37 --> 0:14:39
Jonesy, you are a podcaster now.

338
0:14:39 --> 0:14:43
I am a podcaster in conjunction with the great Jennifer Zabel.

339
0:14:44 --> 0:14:46
She's actually running everything.

340
0:14:48 --> 0:14:52
Yeah, yeah, she's she makes it happen.

341
0:14:52 --> 0:14:56
But I it's, you know, it's you've been on it.

342
0:14:56 --> 0:14:58
It's now actually a thing.

343
0:14:59 --> 0:15:01
It's I just started talking to people

344
0:15:01 --> 0:15:05
that I knew about music and what they liked and music in their lives.

345
0:15:05 --> 0:15:06
And, you know, I had these.

346
0:15:06 --> 0:15:11
I had the idea came through working with David Silverman from The Simpsons

347
0:15:11 --> 0:15:15
because obviously he's not known as a musician.

348
0:15:15 --> 0:15:20
He's known as a great animator and and he but he he's a serious

349
0:15:20 --> 0:15:23
tuba guy and he plays the tuba.

350
0:15:23 --> 0:15:27
And so I said, you know, and then Bill Prady,

351
0:15:27 --> 0:15:30
who does the Big Bang Theory, who wrote that show

352
0:15:30 --> 0:15:34
and many, many others, he started playing the saxophone

353
0:15:34 --> 0:15:35
like when he was 60. Wow.

354
0:15:36 --> 0:15:38
And I said, you know, I know all these people.

355
0:15:39 --> 0:15:44
Yeah, I know all these people that that that music is important to them,

356
0:15:44 --> 0:15:45
even though they're not known for music.

357
0:15:46 --> 0:15:48
And so that's sort of opened the door.

358
0:15:49 --> 0:15:52
And then I started talking with more musicians

359
0:15:52 --> 0:15:57
and also a lot of critics and people that are around music.

360
0:15:58 --> 0:16:00
And I just did I'm very excited.

361
0:16:00 --> 0:16:03
I just did a great conversation with Eric, Eric Mingus,

362
0:16:03 --> 0:16:04
who's Charles Mingus's son.

363
0:16:05 --> 0:16:10
And you know, you don't get much higher up in the jazz royals

364
0:16:10 --> 0:16:14
even Mingus and your stories of him growing up

365
0:16:14 --> 0:16:16
and being there when Mingus met Joni Mitchell.

366
0:16:17 --> 0:16:19
And, you know, it's it's really cool.

367
0:16:19 --> 0:16:21
I mean, I'm enjoying it.

368
0:16:21 --> 0:16:24
I mean, maybe maybe my audience is 10 people.

369
0:16:24 --> 0:16:28
But I'm loving it, you know, you should have Jacob

370
0:16:28 --> 0:16:30
want to talk about kiss because he loves kiss.

371
0:16:30 --> 0:16:32
Yeah, yeah, I know.

372
0:16:32 --> 0:16:37
I mean, that's I'm not, you know, I've I've had I had Scotty Meltzer on.

373
0:16:37 --> 0:16:40
He was a juggler and and I just said,

374
0:16:41 --> 0:16:43
you've got the worst taste in music of anyone I've ever met.

375
0:16:43 --> 0:16:45
Tell us about it.

376
0:16:45 --> 0:16:48
And he did, you know, and it was great.

377
0:16:50 --> 0:16:52
But this is worth some good dose.

378
0:16:52 --> 0:16:54
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

379
0:16:54 --> 0:16:55
Oh, that's impossible.

380
0:16:56 --> 0:16:57
That can't be true.

381
0:16:57 --> 0:16:58
No, it's true.

382
0:16:58 --> 0:17:02
I mean, the only difference between Scotty and Godot is

383
0:17:02 --> 0:17:04
and I will give Scotty the edge on this.

384
0:17:04 --> 0:17:08
I believe Scotty can also appreciate good music

385
0:17:09 --> 0:17:10
better than Godot.

386
0:17:10 --> 0:17:11
You know what I mean?

387
0:17:12 --> 0:17:15
I I think I think Godot has just got, you know,

388
0:17:15 --> 0:17:19
really pedestrian music and and, you know.

389
0:17:19 --> 0:17:20
And you're right.

390
0:17:20 --> 0:17:20
He just doesn't care.

391
0:17:21 --> 0:17:24
Yeah. But Scotty, he actively seeks out

392
0:17:24 --> 0:17:27
every horrific show tune you've ever heard.

393
0:17:27 --> 0:17:30
And and, you know, he was he was in

394
0:17:31 --> 0:17:33
he was like a musical kid.

395
0:17:33 --> 0:17:36
He was in like, you know, musicals as a child and stuff.

396
0:17:37 --> 0:17:39
And it's just so deeply disturbing.

397
0:17:41 --> 0:17:43
I was in a lot of musicals as a child.

398
0:17:44 --> 0:17:46
I don't listen only to show tunes, though.

399
0:17:46 --> 0:17:48
I listen to other music.

400
0:17:49 --> 0:17:50
He can appreciate Miles Davis, too.

401
0:17:51 --> 0:17:52
But I don't think Godot cares

402
0:17:52 --> 0:17:55
whether it's Miles Davis or or Bette Midler.

403
0:17:55 --> 0:17:56
You know what I mean?

404
0:17:56 --> 0:18:00
Um, but so I give Scotty the advantage there.

405
0:18:00 --> 0:18:04
But but but my point is that everybody's got really not everybody.

406
0:18:04 --> 0:18:07
But most people have the people I want to talk to

407
0:18:07 --> 0:18:10
have really interesting stories about growing up with it

408
0:18:10 --> 0:18:12
and what they listen to as kids and how they got into music.

409
0:18:12 --> 0:18:15
And sort of when they realized that music,

410
0:18:15 --> 0:18:17
they were listening to music different than all their classmates.

411
0:18:18 --> 0:18:18
You know what I mean?

412
0:18:19 --> 0:18:20
The music became more important to them,

413
0:18:21 --> 0:18:26
usually at an earlier age than than every than most people.

414
0:18:26 --> 0:18:28
Because I as I used to have to tell my father,

415
0:18:28 --> 0:18:31
who always promoted me, oh, my son's a great jazz piano player.

416
0:18:32 --> 0:18:34
I'd say nobody cares about jazz, dad.

417
0:18:34 --> 0:18:38
And even less people care about solo piano in jazz.

418
0:18:39 --> 0:18:43
So, you know, I'm looking for the people that care about that stuff

419
0:18:43 --> 0:18:46
that are also creative in other ways, writers, you know, and everybody.

420
0:18:47 --> 0:18:49
I mean, just, you know, if you've got interesting stories

421
0:18:49 --> 0:18:52
to talk about, kiss, I want to hear them, you know?

422
0:18:59 --> 0:19:04
I mean, you know, Matt and I talked about some guy from Jersey, some singer,

423
0:19:04 --> 0:19:08
singer, songwriter, Southside Johnny.

424
0:19:09 --> 0:19:11
Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.

425
0:19:11 --> 0:19:13
We did an hour. We did an hour on Southside Johnny.

426
0:19:16 --> 0:19:18
But but that's been a lot of fun.

427
0:19:18 --> 0:19:20
It's really it's it's the stereo image.

428
0:19:20 --> 0:19:22
It's called the stereo image.

429
0:19:22 --> 0:19:23
Stereo image.

430
0:19:23 --> 0:19:26
And we got a great logo

431
0:19:28 --> 0:19:31
done by Matt Rockman, who's doing all the stuff for Penn and Teller these days.

432
0:19:32 --> 0:19:36
And he came up with this really cool, like it's like 3D glasses

433
0:19:36 --> 0:19:39
with the VU meters on it.

434
0:19:39 --> 0:19:42
And it's really because it's sort of retro and it's sort of, you know,

435
0:19:42 --> 0:19:44
it's got a little bit of everything.

436
0:19:44 --> 0:19:49
And the stereo image is on all platforms or the stereo image dot com.

437
0:19:50 --> 0:19:55
And I'm going to do I'm doing Oscar Peterson's daughter next week.

438
0:19:56 --> 0:19:57
She's got great stories.

439
0:19:58 --> 0:20:02
Yeah, I mean, we're really getting I've got I if I were smart,

440
0:20:02 --> 0:20:05
I would have the list of people we've done in front of me, but I don't.

441
0:20:06 --> 0:20:07
But no one's that smart.

442
0:20:08 --> 0:20:12
No, it's OK. Well, I'm, you know, it's but it's Piff and Jade on.

443
0:20:12 --> 0:20:15
It's I had Piff and Jade on and it was hysterical because we did it from

444
0:20:15 --> 0:20:21
the Piff we did our first remote podcast from Piff's lair.

445
0:20:21 --> 0:20:22
Oh, nice cave. Yeah.

446
0:20:23 --> 0:20:27
And it was it was it was a control freak like Piff,

447
0:20:27 --> 0:20:29
making sure that you did it in his studio, not yours.

448
0:20:30 --> 0:20:33
Well, Piff. So I like him.

449
0:20:33 --> 0:20:37
Piff has. Horrific taste.

450
0:20:39 --> 0:20:43
That's what I was curious about. Yeah, I know he likes him.

451
0:20:43 --> 0:20:45
He likes don't know what music he likes.

452
0:20:45 --> 0:20:51
He likes suicidal coffee shop, plaintive, plaintive whaling,

453
0:20:52 --> 0:20:54
singer, songwriter, 18 year old.

454
0:20:55 --> 0:20:57
My boyfriend left me and I kill myself.

455
0:20:57 --> 0:21:00
Music he lives the most practicing.

456
0:21:01 --> 0:21:05
It's it's I mean, and he loves it and he just listens to it,

457
0:21:05 --> 0:21:07
I guess according to Jade all the time.

458
0:21:08 --> 0:21:11
But yeah, we we did it.

459
0:21:11 --> 0:21:13
Yeah, well, we did Dara Godfried.

460
0:21:13 --> 0:21:16
We did, you know, I talked about Gilbert's song.

461
0:21:16 --> 0:21:18
And I mean, we did a lot.

462
0:21:18 --> 0:21:21
I mean, we've got about maybe like 30, 30 done so far.

463
0:21:21 --> 0:21:24
But but I'm looking at Gilbert's taste of music.

464
0:21:25 --> 0:21:28
Gilbert, I don't I don't know if we did.

465
0:21:28 --> 0:21:30
I we did have her very early on.

466
0:21:30 --> 0:21:31
Um, I don't know.

467
0:21:32 --> 0:21:35
We talked about Gilbert's podcast, of course, which was great.

468
0:21:35 --> 0:21:39
Yes, he didn't really we didn't really talk about his music taste.

469
0:21:39 --> 0:21:42
I don't I don't know if Gilbert knew music existed.

470
0:21:43 --> 0:21:44
Yeah, I'm very curious about that.

471
0:21:44 --> 0:21:45
I'll tell you one thing.

472
0:21:45 --> 0:21:46
I'll tell you a Gilbert story.

473
0:21:47 --> 0:21:51
I I was at so Gilbert was over at my house.

474
0:21:51 --> 0:21:57
This is 20 years ago, 15 years ago, and we're just hanging out.

475
0:21:59 --> 0:22:02
And I told our friend, Michael Lynn, we had a mutual friend,

476
0:22:02 --> 0:22:05
Mickey Lynn, whose whose father had passed away.

477
0:22:06 --> 0:22:09
And he asked me, Mickey, his father loved Mark's brothers.

478
0:22:10 --> 0:22:17
And he asked me if I would play a version of hello, I must be going

479
0:22:17 --> 0:22:21
for him to play at the funeral and recorded for him.

480
0:22:21 --> 0:22:24
So I did, you know, and I was telling Gilbert that story,

481
0:22:24 --> 0:22:25
who knew who knew Mickey as well.

482
0:22:25 --> 0:22:31
And all of a sudden, Gilbert launches into a perfect rendition

483
0:22:31 --> 0:22:35
of of old groucho singing, hello, I must be going.

484
0:22:36 --> 0:22:41
And I totally spaced that Gilbert did perfect groucho.

485
0:22:41 --> 0:22:42
It was like young groucho.

486
0:22:43 --> 0:22:45
You bet your life groucho and old groucho.

487
0:22:45 --> 0:22:49
And he's just walking around my kitchen like, hello, I must be going.

488
0:22:49 --> 0:22:51
You know, and I just lost it.

489
0:22:51 --> 0:22:55
I was like, oh, fuck, you know, I forgot you're a genius.

490
0:22:56 --> 0:22:58
But he's my favorite impersonation.

491
0:22:58 --> 0:23:00
One of my favorites was his impersonation of Penn.

492
0:23:02 --> 0:23:06
Because we're at lunch one day and he's and he's sitting there.

493
0:23:06 --> 0:23:09
And all of a sudden, Gilbert's just looking at the table.

494
0:23:09 --> 0:23:11
We're waiting for the waiters to come over and there's these salt shakers,

495
0:23:12 --> 0:23:12
salt and pepper shakers.

496
0:23:12 --> 0:23:18
And he goes, oh, salt, salt, oh, let's look at the salt today this week.

497
0:23:18 --> 0:23:20
And then he goes into Penn and he goes this week on bullshit.

498
0:23:20 --> 0:23:25
We've got the National Salt Association because salt is pro salt.

499
0:23:25 --> 0:23:26
And then we've got the Anti-Salt Association.

500
0:23:26 --> 0:23:27
Salt is bullshit.

501
0:23:31 --> 0:23:38
He did five minutes of Penn talking about salt and it was just genius.

502
0:23:39 --> 0:23:43
But yeah, he I'm missing that he was great.

503
0:23:44 --> 0:23:47
But anyhow, but we got off.

504
0:23:48 --> 0:23:52
But yeah, the podcast is great and everyone should listen and subscribe

505
0:23:52 --> 0:23:57
and make me famous and then also because, you know,

506
0:23:57 --> 0:23:58
how long can I play this piano?

507
0:23:58 --> 0:24:00
I really belong in podcasting.

508
0:24:03 --> 0:24:06
Um, the non stop world of podcasting.

509
0:24:07 --> 0:24:07
That's right.

510
0:24:08 --> 0:24:12
Uh, do you really see like a world where you use your, your, your,

511
0:24:13 --> 0:24:13
you don't play piano?

512
0:24:15 --> 0:24:16
Yeah, that world is when I'm dead.

513
0:24:17 --> 0:24:18
That's what I thought.

514
0:24:18 --> 0:24:23
Yeah, I often want to be, I want to be like the 93 year old guy

515
0:24:23 --> 0:24:26
that they wheel out in a wheelchair chair and say, you know,

516
0:24:26 --> 0:24:29
jazz legend Mike Jones and I, and I eat a little pudding

517
0:24:29 --> 0:24:32
and I play a couple of songs and he's like, isn't it amazing?

518
0:24:32 --> 0:24:33
He could still play at this age.

519
0:24:33 --> 0:24:35
Okay, get him off the stage.

520
0:24:35 --> 0:24:38
You know, that's, that's what I see my, my golden years.

521
0:24:38 --> 0:24:42
I just saw a video, a TikTok with an elderly woman

522
0:24:42 --> 0:24:44
who's suffering from dementia.

523
0:24:44 --> 0:24:45
She's I believe 93.

524
0:24:46 --> 0:24:50
And maybe you saw this, Jonesy, but she's a classically trained

525
0:24:50 --> 0:24:54
pianist, but she doesn't remember that she's a classically

526
0:24:54 --> 0:24:55
trained pianist anymore.

527
0:24:55 --> 0:24:58
However, they consider in front of a piano and say,

528
0:24:58 --> 0:24:59
could you play such and such?

529
0:24:59 --> 0:25:01
And she's like, well, I don't know it, but then she'll do it.

530
0:25:02 --> 0:25:02
You know, right?

531
0:25:02 --> 0:25:03
I have seen it.

532
0:25:03 --> 0:25:06
Yeah, it's remarkable at the way there it is, the way music

533
0:25:07 --> 0:25:10
acts in the brain is something special.

534
0:25:11 --> 0:25:11
Oh, it is.

535
0:25:11 --> 0:25:14
Jonesy, would that be better or worse than current life?

536
0:25:14 --> 0:25:15
Would it be better or worse?

537
0:25:16 --> 0:25:19
I think you could still play anything, any piece of music

538
0:25:19 --> 0:25:22
that you could play now, you can play it, but you don't

539
0:25:22 --> 0:25:23
remember any of the music.

540
0:25:23 --> 0:25:25
So you don't have to think about any of the music.

541
0:25:25 --> 0:25:26
I love life.

542
0:25:26 --> 0:25:28
This is a dream.

543
0:25:30 --> 0:25:33
I I just want to I just want to sit somewhere and have them

544
0:25:33 --> 0:25:34
give me pudding.

545
0:25:34 --> 0:25:36
And that's that's really all I want.

546
0:25:36 --> 0:25:38
I don't really care about pudding.

547
0:25:39 --> 0:25:42
But but I'm we're used to you were saying something, Matt.

548
0:25:43 --> 0:25:45
Yeah, well, two different ways.

549
0:25:45 --> 0:25:47
One, I think you're the kind of kid that you didn't have to

550
0:25:47 --> 0:25:49
be like encouraged, like your parents

551
0:25:49 --> 0:25:50
enough like overly encouraged you to take piano.

552
0:25:50 --> 0:25:52
If anything, they took piano away from you as a punishment.

553
0:25:52 --> 0:25:53
Right? Yeah.

554
0:25:53 --> 0:25:56
Yeah, I was when I was like two and a half.

555
0:25:56 --> 0:25:58
My brother, who's five years older, was taking lessons.

556
0:25:58 --> 0:26:01
And I guess I would crawl up on the piano bench and play what

557
0:26:01 --> 0:26:02
he had been practicing.

558
0:26:03 --> 0:26:07
And so my parents unfortunately thought, well, we can make

559
0:26:07 --> 0:26:08
money off this kid.

560
0:26:08 --> 0:26:11
We'll send him to less, you know.

561
0:26:11 --> 0:26:14
And no, they just they just they always encouraged me.

562
0:26:14 --> 0:26:15
I had two player pianos in my house.

563
0:26:16 --> 0:26:20
So it was always around and it's all I wanted to do.

564
0:26:20 --> 0:26:23
And when I was in the third grade, my piano teacher said,

565
0:26:23 --> 0:26:25
you know, I don't ever get up before 10 or 11 in the

566
0:26:25 --> 0:26:27
morning. And that was a job for me.

567
0:26:28 --> 0:26:29
You were like, I can do that.

568
0:26:30 --> 0:26:32
Yeah, I hated getting up in the morning.

569
0:26:33 --> 0:26:33
Now, wait a minute.

570
0:26:33 --> 0:26:35
You said you had to play your pianos.

571
0:26:36 --> 0:26:38
Yeah, you know, the you know, the like with the scrolls,

572
0:26:38 --> 0:26:40
with the scroll and paper running through it and everything.

573
0:26:40 --> 0:26:42
Now they're now they're all, you know, now they're like

574
0:26:42 --> 0:26:45
Yamaha, Disclavier, and they don't know it's all it's all.

575
0:26:45 --> 0:26:48
But yes, in the olden days, it was a paper roll and it

576
0:26:48 --> 0:26:50
would go over a vacuum system that would cause the keys

577
0:26:50 --> 0:26:51
to go up and down.

578
0:26:51 --> 0:26:54
And we had an upright piano in my basement.

579
0:26:54 --> 0:26:57
And then in my living room, when I was about probably

580
0:26:57 --> 0:27:01
six or seven, my dad bought what was called a reproducing

581
0:27:01 --> 0:27:05
grand, which would 1926 when it was made, was the state

582
0:27:05 --> 0:27:07
of the art for rich people.

583
0:27:07 --> 0:27:09
It these may they made these roles.

584
0:27:09 --> 0:27:14
They were called expression pianos and they got louder

585
0:27:14 --> 0:27:16
and softer and sustained.

586
0:27:16 --> 0:27:19
So it didn't sound mechanical like a player piano.

587
0:27:19 --> 0:27:19
Oh, right.

588
0:27:20 --> 0:27:22
Like so I grew up with George Gershwin playing

589
0:27:22 --> 0:27:25
Rhapsody in Blue as if he was sitting at the piano

590
0:27:25 --> 0:27:26
in my house playing it.

591
0:27:27 --> 0:27:30
And they made a, you know, there was a company called

592
0:27:30 --> 0:27:34
Dewart and Ampico and Welty Mignon.

593
0:27:34 --> 0:27:37
And they were all these, they made these for the super rich.

594
0:27:38 --> 0:27:40
You know, I mean, when you're watching or when you're

595
0:27:40 --> 0:27:43
seeing that happen on that that piano machine,

596
0:27:44 --> 0:27:48
are you beyond just hearing the intonations and the ups

597
0:27:48 --> 0:27:50
and downs and the very, you know, the very nuanced

598
0:27:50 --> 0:27:52
playing of these masters?

599
0:27:52 --> 0:27:55
Are you also able to pick up on the mechanics of it?

600
0:27:55 --> 0:27:58
Does it does it come through and like the pedal step moves

601
0:27:58 --> 0:27:59
and all that kind of thing too?

602
0:27:59 --> 0:28:02
The pedal doesn't move, but the keys obviously go up and down.

603
0:28:03 --> 0:28:06
But were you able to study that was was that it was great?

604
0:28:06 --> 0:28:08
Yeah, because like if I put a Fats Waller piano roll on

605
0:28:08 --> 0:28:10
and I wanted to see what he was doing with his left hand,

606
0:28:12 --> 0:28:16
although it was many, many years, maybe like till I was

607
0:28:16 --> 0:28:20
11 or 12, when it dawned on me, wait a minute,

608
0:28:20 --> 0:28:22
sometimes there's 11 keys going down.

609
0:28:23 --> 0:28:25
Maybe there's more than one person playing here.

610
0:28:25 --> 0:28:28
Then I found out it was well, they would double track them.

611
0:28:28 --> 0:28:32
Oh, wow. They would, you know, they would wait.

612
0:28:32 --> 0:28:33
And I've made piano rolls.

613
0:28:33 --> 0:28:34
I got to go to Q.R.S.

614
0:28:35 --> 0:28:39
And make piano wasn't the same piano that Duke Ellington

615
0:28:39 --> 0:28:42
and and and Ella Fitzgerald and Rachmaninoff and everybody played.

616
0:28:43 --> 0:28:46
Is there like a whole bunch connected to the to the piano key as well?

617
0:28:46 --> 0:28:48
No, it was more crazy than that.

618
0:28:49 --> 0:28:50
It's ink things.

619
0:28:51 --> 0:28:54
So the sheet of paper goes through, you press the keys down,

620
0:28:54 --> 0:28:58
it puts ink on the paper and then somebody stands,

621
0:28:59 --> 0:29:02
somebody sits there and cuts out a master roll by hand.

622
0:29:02 --> 0:29:03
Not at all.

623
0:29:04 --> 0:29:07
And then they then they make the master roll

624
0:29:07 --> 0:29:09
and then they produce them from that.

625
0:29:09 --> 0:29:11
So it's it's amazing.

626
0:29:11 --> 0:29:16
And I mean, at a time they had like 40 people in a room

627
0:29:16 --> 0:29:21
cutting out master rolls every day because it was so popular in the 20s and 30s.

628
0:29:21 --> 0:29:22
You know, and it's incredible.

629
0:29:23 --> 0:29:28
Yeah, it was really, really, really, you know, like old timey technology.

630
0:29:29 --> 0:29:33
And but the piano was so cool because it was an old, I think it was a Steinway.

631
0:29:34 --> 0:29:38
But it had been played so much that the ivory keys were all like

632
0:29:39 --> 0:29:43
scalloped in. Yeah. So that, you know, it was like soft, you know,

633
0:29:43 --> 0:29:46
there was there was like that much, wow, taken down on the keys

634
0:29:46 --> 0:29:49
just from the millions of people that played it out for 100 years.

635
0:29:50 --> 0:29:54
Yeah. And and like the little lip on the edge of the key is just completely gone.

636
0:29:54 --> 0:29:56
Like that little lip is worn away.

637
0:29:56 --> 0:29:58
Yeah, it's worn away from ivory.

638
0:29:58 --> 0:30:01
And and I think it's in the Smithsonian now.

639
0:30:01 --> 0:30:04
But but it's it was really cool in the 80s.

640
0:30:04 --> 0:30:09
The guy actually turns out that because they let black people play the piano,

641
0:30:09 --> 0:30:10
it had to be taken out.

642
0:30:10 --> 0:30:12
They took it to display down.

643
0:30:12 --> 0:30:13
Ah, yeah, that's a good job, man.

644
0:30:14 --> 0:30:16
It happens. It happens. Ouch.

645
0:30:17 --> 0:30:23
But anyways, so that's yeah, I've been, you know, so no, I was I I want to play,

646
0:30:23 --> 0:30:26
you know, I mean, as they say, I'll play till I drop dead, you know,

647
0:30:27 --> 0:30:30
if I can't like arthritis or I'd rather not have that.

648
0:30:33 --> 0:30:38
No, I actually, I mean, certainly I have I'm always on the edge.

649
0:30:38 --> 0:30:41
Um, I I

650
0:30:42 --> 0:30:47
I have I can I have like some tendinitis and some carpal tunnel,

651
0:30:47 --> 0:30:50
but not not to where it's affecting me.

652
0:30:50 --> 0:30:53
And I think the reason it doesn't is because I play so much.

653
0:30:53 --> 0:30:57
Um, but you don't relax long enough for it to set in.

654
0:30:58 --> 0:31:01
Well, what happens is, um, yeah, um,

655
0:31:02 --> 0:31:05
I take tumor turmeric and glucose amine and chondroitin

656
0:31:05 --> 0:31:07
and, you know, to stave off stuff like that.

657
0:31:07 --> 0:31:11
But what what what one of the great things about playing with the show

658
0:31:11 --> 0:31:14
on their fiftieth about five in the last five years,

659
0:31:14 --> 0:31:18
they develop this new technology for I couldn't play a keyboard ever.

660
0:31:18 --> 0:31:22
That was why it was always we can't take you on the road

661
0:31:22 --> 0:31:25
because we you can't play a keyboard because when you play a keyboard

662
0:31:25 --> 0:31:28
real quickly on pianists will notice.

663
0:31:29 --> 0:31:31
There's a there's a thing I think it's called the escapement

664
0:31:32 --> 0:31:34
at the bottom of when you press a piano down,

665
0:31:35 --> 0:31:37
if you press a piano key down very slowly,

666
0:31:37 --> 0:31:40
there'll be this little hitch at the very bottom and then it goes to the bottom.

667
0:31:41 --> 0:31:44
And that absorbs all the shock

668
0:31:45 --> 0:31:47
of the piano key hitting the bottom of the key bed.

669
0:31:49 --> 0:31:53
And even though they developed weighted keys for keyboards,

670
0:31:53 --> 0:31:56
there was never that kind of cushion.

671
0:31:56 --> 0:32:00
So your arm absorbed the entire shock of the of the key hitting

672
0:32:00 --> 0:32:02
and it would set me off in 20 minutes.

673
0:32:02 --> 0:32:05
And I never realized that.

674
0:32:05 --> 0:32:06
That's crazy. Yeah.

675
0:32:06 --> 0:32:08
And just in the last five years,

676
0:32:08 --> 0:32:11
Yamaha and Kawhi developed this new technology

677
0:32:12 --> 0:32:16
in their keyboards that has that feel.

678
0:32:16 --> 0:32:19
And I can play them all day and it doesn't bother me at all.

679
0:32:20 --> 0:32:23
And and it's actually better for the show

680
0:32:23 --> 0:32:27
because they don't have to mic the piano when I get there

681
0:32:27 --> 0:32:28
or anything like that.

682
0:32:28 --> 0:32:31
They just I mean, it's not the same as an acoustic

683
0:32:31 --> 0:32:35
seven foot piano, but it's really close enough for for for them.

684
0:32:35 --> 0:32:37
And and I like playing it.

685
0:32:37 --> 0:32:40
So so Kawhi is, you know, I'm a Kawhi artist

686
0:32:40 --> 0:32:42
and they just have one there for me.

687
0:32:42 --> 0:32:43
It's really great.

688
0:32:43 --> 0:32:46
Did you hear how he said it was good enough for them?

689
0:32:46 --> 0:32:47
It's good enough.

690
0:32:47 --> 0:32:50
Well, no, I mean, yeah, it's good enough for a magic show.

691
0:32:51 --> 0:32:51
All right.

692
0:32:52 --> 0:32:55
For the people setting up this fucking keyboard

693
0:32:55 --> 0:32:57
that don't want to go to the trouble of setting up a piano

694
0:32:57 --> 0:33:00
like a person. That's right.

695
0:33:00 --> 0:33:02
It's good enough for it.

696
0:33:02 --> 0:33:05
Also, it also means that the floating

697
0:33:05 --> 0:33:07
piano allusions back on the table.

698
0:33:07 --> 0:33:08
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

699
0:33:08 --> 0:33:10
Absolutely. Yeah.

700
0:33:10 --> 0:33:12
Have you got a piano?

701
0:33:12 --> 0:33:14
We don't knock it out of tune.

702
0:33:14 --> 0:33:16
You don't want to, you don't want to move that piano around.

703
0:33:16 --> 0:33:20
I'm happy to be in the floating piano allusion.

704
0:33:20 --> 0:33:22
I'm very happy to be in it.

705
0:33:22 --> 0:33:24
I just don't want to be responsible for it.

706
0:33:26 --> 0:33:29
I don't want to have to tune the piano after it's done.

707
0:33:29 --> 0:33:33
Yeah, yeah, it's like I had this stupid idea

708
0:33:33 --> 0:33:36
for Andy Cheek in the chat.

709
0:33:36 --> 0:33:37
Kiss fans won't hear the difference.

710
0:33:38 --> 0:33:39
Fuck you, Andy Cheek.

711
0:33:40 --> 0:33:42
Tough talk. Wow.

712
0:33:42 --> 0:33:45
You know, some coming from the blood.

713
0:33:46 --> 0:33:48
Some of the 100 members of Kiss of the past two centuries

714
0:33:49 --> 0:33:51
actually know more than two cores.

715
0:33:51 --> 0:33:52
That's true.

716
0:33:52 --> 0:33:53
Well, no, Ace Fraley died.

717
0:33:54 --> 0:33:55
So it's not anymore.

718
0:33:56 --> 0:33:57
Yeah. Yeah.

719
0:33:58 --> 0:34:00
But it's anyhow.

720
0:34:01 --> 0:34:03
Yeah, the piano with the piano

721
0:34:03 --> 0:34:06
situation has gotten really good finally.

722
0:34:06 --> 0:34:07
But so my hands don't hurt.

723
0:34:07 --> 0:34:09
You know, I'm really lucky.

724
0:34:09 --> 0:34:13
I mean, I I've been playing for I've been playing the piano

725
0:34:13 --> 0:34:14
for almost 60 years.

726
0:34:15 --> 0:34:21
But you know, and and a lot of old

727
0:34:21 --> 0:34:23
piano players that I've known over the years, you know,

728
0:34:23 --> 0:34:25
have not had problems with arthritis.

729
0:34:25 --> 0:34:27
But then again, like Oscar had it really bad,

730
0:34:28 --> 0:34:31
Oscar Peterson, and they just play through it, you know.

731
0:34:32 --> 0:34:33
But I've been lucky.

732
0:34:34 --> 0:34:37
I mean, I still have most of my faculties, not mental at all.

733
0:34:37 --> 0:34:39
I'm but overrated.

734
0:34:40 --> 0:34:44
But in anyways, and so if this is going out,

735
0:34:44 --> 0:34:47
but I will self promotion to jump off.

736
0:34:47 --> 0:34:50
If this is if anyone's hearing this on Monday in Vegas

737
0:34:50 --> 0:34:52
and have nothing to do tonight, meaning Monday,

738
0:34:53 --> 0:34:55
go down to Vicks at 7 p.m.

739
0:34:55 --> 0:34:58
Because I'm recording two different live albums in one night.

740
0:34:58 --> 0:34:59
Oh, nice.

741
0:35:00 --> 0:35:01
Or so 9 p.m.

742
0:35:01 --> 0:35:02
Two for the second set.

743
0:35:02 --> 0:35:04
Vicks downtown by the Smith Center.

744
0:35:06 --> 0:35:08
Yes. Oh, I would have put this here.

745
0:35:08 --> 0:35:09
I thought I thought this episode was coming out too late.

746
0:35:10 --> 0:35:10
It's coming out.

747
0:35:11 --> 0:35:12
Oh, no, it's no, it's it's Monday night.

748
0:35:13 --> 0:35:14
OK, tonight.

749
0:35:15 --> 0:35:16
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,

750
0:35:17 --> 0:35:20
and it's it's the first set's going to be me and great.

751
0:35:21 --> 0:35:22
Yes, yeah.

752
0:35:23 --> 0:35:25
Every time I say Graham's name, Matt coughs.

753
0:35:25 --> 0:35:26
Yeah, you can't help it.

754
0:35:26 --> 0:35:27
He's allergic to Graham Dexter.

755
0:35:28 --> 0:35:31
Um, I'm doing it with Graham Dexter,

756
0:35:31 --> 0:35:34
who's an amazing guitar player and Alex Frank,

757
0:35:34 --> 0:35:36
who's an amazing bass player who found Penn's bass for him,

758
0:35:37 --> 0:35:39
who's a great he runs.

759
0:35:39 --> 0:35:41
He plays the bass in Jeff Goldblum's band,

760
0:35:42 --> 0:35:43
which is all hot L.A.

761
0:35:44 --> 0:35:46
studio players and Jeff Goldblum, but.

762
0:35:49 --> 0:35:55
It's but it's it's really it's it's we're doing like in the 1940s and 50s,

763
0:35:55 --> 0:35:57
right after World War Two,

764
0:35:57 --> 0:36:03
the most popular jazz combo setup was piano, bass and guitar.

765
0:36:03 --> 0:36:06
And so Nat King Cole's trio was piano, bass, guitar.

766
0:36:07 --> 0:36:08
Oscar Peterson had a trio.

767
0:36:09 --> 0:36:10
Art Tatum had a trio.

768
0:36:10 --> 0:36:11
That was like the thing.

769
0:36:11 --> 0:36:13
And then sort of in the 50s,

770
0:36:13 --> 0:36:15
drums work their way in, you know,

771
0:36:15 --> 0:36:17
because they felt sorry for drummers couldn't get a gig.

772
0:36:18 --> 0:36:23
So they gave them gigs and that that format sort of went away.

773
0:36:24 --> 0:36:25
And nobody does it really anymore.

774
0:36:26 --> 0:36:31
And I got together with these guys sort of as a tribute to that kind of music.

775
0:36:31 --> 0:36:33
And we did a record in my living room a few years ago.

776
0:36:34 --> 0:36:38
And the record label said you guys should do a real live album

777
0:36:38 --> 0:36:39
because it's really good.

778
0:36:39 --> 0:36:43
And there there's so much fun to play with that I'm really looking forward to it.

779
0:36:43 --> 0:36:49
And then because of a lot of behind the scenes stuff,

780
0:36:50 --> 0:36:52
the gram at the last minute wasn't sure he could do it.

781
0:36:52 --> 0:36:57
So I hired a drummer and then when Graham said he could do it,

782
0:36:57 --> 0:37:00
I said to the label, hey, why don't we just do two albums?

783
0:37:00 --> 0:37:04
I'll do one with the trio with the drummer and one with the trio with Graham.

784
0:37:04 --> 0:37:11
And the label love the idea because Capri Records is not a mega mega corporation.

785
0:37:11 --> 0:37:14
So basically he's getting two records for the price of one.

786
0:37:14 --> 0:37:15
Right.

787
0:37:15 --> 0:37:17
And and it's just twice the work for me.

788
0:37:18 --> 0:37:21
So I was going to say, you volunteered to do all of the extra work

789
0:37:21 --> 0:37:23
and they didn't have to. I'm an idiot. Yeah, let's.

790
0:37:23 --> 0:37:26
That isn't clear to everyone listening now.

791
0:37:27 --> 0:37:31
I am an idiot and you know, not only are there to be killer bands

792
0:37:31 --> 0:37:34
that Jonesy has assembled here, but if you have not gone to VIX,

793
0:37:35 --> 0:37:38
it is a great Vegas. It's a nice room.

794
0:37:38 --> 0:37:40
It's really the sound too.

795
0:37:40 --> 0:37:44
I mean, besides the fact that the staff and the food is great

796
0:37:45 --> 0:37:49
and the staff is amazing and everybody wants to be polite and helpful.

797
0:37:50 --> 0:37:53
The room, I believe I may be talking out of my ass,

798
0:37:53 --> 0:37:54
which I have been since I got on the call,

799
0:37:55 --> 0:37:59
but I believe that the room was designed by the guy

800
0:37:59 --> 0:38:00
that did the Jazz at Lincoln Center room.

801
0:38:00 --> 0:38:02
They brought him in for the acoustics.

802
0:38:03 --> 0:38:07
And I'm telling you, you can play that place with no amplification.

803
0:38:07 --> 0:38:08
It's 88 seats.

804
0:38:09 --> 0:38:12
And is that a reference to the it is?

805
0:38:12 --> 0:38:15
It is one for every key on on the saxophone, right?

806
0:38:15 --> 0:38:18
I would have to be the person at that venue

807
0:38:18 --> 0:38:22
that is in charge of making sure they're always exactly 88 seats.

808
0:38:24 --> 0:38:27
I'm sorry, we can't let you both in.

809
0:38:27 --> 0:38:28
We can only let one of you in.

810
0:38:28 --> 0:38:32
We can let eight more people in and we'll call it a Bosendorfer

811
0:38:32 --> 0:38:33
because they have.

812
0:38:34 --> 0:38:38
Oh, but no, and it's but the room is great.

813
0:38:38 --> 0:38:41
The sound is great and they record really well.

814
0:38:41 --> 0:38:44
And I think it's going to be a really fun time

815
0:38:44 --> 0:38:48
or it's going to be something that people want to witness for other reasons.

816
0:38:48 --> 0:38:53
You know, I'll be having a meltdown on stage doing the 14th of a song.

817
0:38:53 --> 0:38:55
None of it's right. None of it's right.

818
0:38:55 --> 0:38:58
You know, no, no, because I'm going to warn everyone, you know,

819
0:38:58 --> 0:39:02
they know we're putting all the social media is saying live album recording.

820
0:39:02 --> 0:39:06
So and I was on I was on Sunday School

821
0:39:06 --> 0:39:09
and I said to Penn, Penn said, oh, so you can tell them if they heckle,

822
0:39:09 --> 0:39:11
it'll come on to the record.

823
0:39:11 --> 0:39:15
And, you know, I said, oh, that's great, you know, I and the hecklers

824
0:39:15 --> 0:39:19
will get are like, wait a minute, that's the Mixolydian mode.

825
0:39:19 --> 0:39:22
Did you just play a flat five on that chord?

826
0:39:22 --> 0:39:23
What's wrong with you?

827
0:39:23 --> 0:39:26
Yeah, jazz, jazz, hecklers are the worst.

828
0:39:27 --> 0:39:28
Yeah, yeah.

829
0:39:29 --> 0:39:32
Wait, did was was that a Bill Evans quote you just played?

830
0:39:33 --> 0:39:33
Come on.

831
0:39:35 --> 0:39:39
But but anyhow, it'll be no, it'll be a lot of fun.

832
0:39:40 --> 0:39:43
And and I'm really I've been trying to get this done for two years.

833
0:39:44 --> 0:39:49
And I think that, you know, I so I in preparation, I had my head cut open.

834
0:39:50 --> 0:39:53
So, um, yeah, yeah.

835
0:39:53 --> 0:39:56
Because, you know, I said to Jen, I hope your Photoshop skills are good enough.

836
0:39:58 --> 0:40:00
You're not going to wear a fancy hat.

837
0:40:00 --> 0:40:01
Well, here's the problem.

838
0:40:02 --> 0:40:07
I probably will wear a fancy hat, but I tried to wear a fancy hat

839
0:40:07 --> 0:40:08
in the show last night.

840
0:40:08 --> 0:40:12
We were back at the Rio and I wore on one of the hat from blue

841
0:40:12 --> 0:40:14
kazoo bit, which is a fancy hat.

842
0:40:15 --> 0:40:17
I mean, those hats like or expensive.

843
0:40:18 --> 0:40:20
And I had a lot of Kazoo is outrageous.

844
0:40:20 --> 0:40:24
Well, the budget was through the roof.

845
0:40:24 --> 0:40:28
I mean, but I look horrible in hats.

846
0:40:28 --> 0:40:34
I just don't have a head for hats and but I put it on and Penn says to me,

847
0:40:35 --> 0:40:36
it looks like it's going to fall off your head.

848
0:40:36 --> 0:40:37
Pull it down.

849
0:40:37 --> 0:40:39
It's supposed to be, you know, and so I put it down because, yeah,

850
0:40:39 --> 0:40:40
that's a lot better.

851
0:40:40 --> 0:40:42
So I wore it for the whole pre-show, right?

852
0:40:42 --> 0:40:51
And I come back to my dressing room and from here to here is bright purple.

853
0:40:52 --> 0:40:53
All of the front of your head.

854
0:40:53 --> 0:40:55
You're holding your whole forehead.

855
0:40:55 --> 0:40:55
Yeah.

856
0:40:56 --> 0:40:59
And I'm like, oh my God, I screwed up everything.

857
0:40:59 --> 0:41:01
It cut off the blood flow.

858
0:41:01 --> 0:41:02
What's going to happen?

859
0:41:02 --> 0:41:05
I go to go to the emergency room because I don't worry about anything.

860
0:41:06 --> 0:41:10
And and it's like there was like a ridge and it had just like cut the

861
0:41:10 --> 0:41:14
because I guess because it's just all sensitive from the surgery.

862
0:41:14 --> 0:41:18
And they pull all your skin together so it gets super tight.

863
0:41:18 --> 0:41:19
Oh, yeah.

864
0:41:19 --> 0:41:22
So for three nights, I couldn't sleep because if I did this,

865
0:41:22 --> 0:41:23
it hurt up here.

866
0:41:23 --> 0:41:28
Ah, you know, and touch your chin and the top of your head would start hurting.

867
0:41:28 --> 0:41:29
Yeah.

868
0:41:29 --> 0:41:29
Really?

869
0:41:29 --> 0:41:30
Seriously.

870
0:41:30 --> 0:41:31
I was trying to shave yesterday.

871
0:41:31 --> 0:41:35
I'm like, oh, um, but so anyways, but luckily it's gone away now.

872
0:41:35 --> 0:41:36
And I think I'll be okay.

873
0:41:36 --> 0:41:38
But that goes that idea for that hat.

874
0:41:39 --> 0:41:42
In the chat is suggesting maybe you could use one of our

875
0:41:42 --> 0:41:42
fezzes.

876
0:41:42 --> 0:41:46
We do have patented, well, I thought about that.

877
0:41:46 --> 0:41:51
I also thought about, um, uh, you know, like, um, just like, uh,

878
0:41:51 --> 0:41:54
a Nick cap, like I'm going on a killing spree.

879
0:41:54 --> 0:41:58
Um, I'm like a dainty bonnet or something like that.

880
0:41:58 --> 0:42:01
Have you thought that would be recommended to do rag?

881
0:42:01 --> 0:42:02
A full ball of club.

882
0:42:02 --> 0:42:03
It would be kind of wild.

883
0:42:03 --> 0:42:05
You know, um, just look at the chat.

884
0:42:06 --> 0:42:08
It says a chef's hat, a chef's hat would be great.

885
0:42:09 --> 0:42:09
Yeah.

886
0:42:09 --> 0:42:12
Well, the problem is, and I mean, I know we're all just joking,

887
0:42:12 --> 0:42:16
but the problem is they all have a thing that will cut off the circulation.

888
0:42:16 --> 0:42:17
Not this.

889
0:42:17 --> 0:42:18
This, this is not.

890
0:42:18 --> 0:42:18
Is it?

891
0:42:19 --> 0:42:20
No, no, no, no, no.

892
0:42:21 --> 0:42:22
I figured it out.

893
0:42:23 --> 0:42:25
Bucket of chicken, bucket of chicken.

894
0:42:25 --> 0:42:27
Right over the, yeah, yeah.

895
0:42:28 --> 0:42:30
Bucket head, jazz bucket head.

896
0:42:30 --> 0:42:31
I tribute the bucket head.

897
0:42:32 --> 0:42:34
Oh, you know, that'd be awesome.

898
0:42:34 --> 0:42:35
Won't touch the head at all.

899
0:42:36 --> 0:42:39
No lamp lampshade would also work.

900
0:42:39 --> 0:42:40
Yeah, lampshade.

901
0:42:40 --> 0:42:40
Yeah.

902
0:42:40 --> 0:42:45
You could do, you could do a popcorn bucket and cut a hole at the top

903
0:42:45 --> 0:42:47
and be like, I'm wearing this completely wrong.

904
0:42:48 --> 0:42:49
Right.

905
0:42:54 --> 0:42:58
I'm bad at this, but I need one of those things that they, you know,

906
0:42:58 --> 0:43:03
they screw on your head for brain surgery, you know, a halo, a halo,

907
0:43:03 --> 0:43:05
and they just drape something over it.

908
0:43:06 --> 0:43:10
Now you're thinking, I know this is the kind of thoughts that get you,

909
0:43:10 --> 0:43:12
get you a real, real career.

910
0:43:13 --> 0:43:15
But anyhow, no, it'll, it'll all be fine.

911
0:43:15 --> 0:43:21
But, but it's healing up well and hopefully by the time I play

912
0:43:21 --> 0:43:24
the Green Mill next week, I won't have to have a bandage or hat.

913
0:43:24 --> 0:43:29
Well, I'll need a hat for Chicago, but, but it's, yeah, but it's,

914
0:43:29 --> 0:43:33
it's, it's the, the, the Monday night thing is going to be

915
0:43:35 --> 0:43:38
something that I've been looking forward to for a few years.

916
0:43:38 --> 0:43:41
But also, yeah, there's a little bit of pressure on me,

917
0:43:41 --> 0:43:45
but it's, I think that the joy will outweigh the pressure.

918
0:43:45 --> 0:43:48
You want the pressure, you need the pressure, you need it.

919
0:43:48 --> 0:43:50
Yeah, yeah, it's a pressure cooker.

920
0:43:50 --> 0:43:51
No pressure, no diamonds.

921
0:43:51 --> 0:43:52
I perform best when under pressure.

922
0:43:54 --> 0:43:56
No, I think that the fun will weigh out.

923
0:43:56 --> 0:43:58
Beautiful jazz is best under pressure.

924
0:43:59 --> 0:43:59
Damn right.

925
0:44:00 --> 0:44:06
Well, all of the stuff that I'm doing for this, like producing it,

926
0:44:06 --> 0:44:09
and Jen, of course, is like making all this shit happen too.

927
0:44:11 --> 0:44:12
This is not the way I make records.

928
0:44:12 --> 0:44:18
Usually the company says, we got a recording date and who do you

929
0:44:18 --> 0:44:18
want on it?

930
0:44:18 --> 0:44:20
And I go into the studio and I make it.

931
0:44:21 --> 0:44:25
But this record and the record before this, I'm doing all the

932
0:44:25 --> 0:44:29
work because the label is in Colorado and he can't leave to

933
0:44:29 --> 0:44:30
come to Vegas.

934
0:44:30 --> 0:44:32
And the last record was with Penn and Jeff Hamilton.

935
0:44:33 --> 0:44:36
So I have to make sure that Jeff Hamilton is happy and I

936
0:44:36 --> 0:44:38
have to book the studio and I have to do, you know, and

937
0:44:38 --> 0:44:39
all this stuff, I'm incompetent.

938
0:44:40 --> 0:44:42
I don't, I can barely fucking feed myself.

939
0:44:42 --> 0:44:49
You know, so I, you know, it's all of that on top of trying to

940
0:44:49 --> 0:44:52
play good songs for people and not, you know, make a fool of

941
0:44:52 --> 0:44:53
myself as a musician.

942
0:44:54 --> 0:44:55
You know, it's just a lot of different pressure.

943
0:44:55 --> 0:44:57
But, but it's, but it's fine.

944
0:44:57 --> 0:44:59
I mean, we get, we'll get there.

945
0:44:59 --> 0:45:00
It'll be fun.

946
0:45:00 --> 0:45:05
And, and they wisely give us a meal.

947
0:45:05 --> 0:45:08
So I know that I'm really just working for food at the

948
0:45:08 --> 0:45:12
end of the, you know, when the recording's done, I get

949
0:45:12 --> 0:45:12
fed.

950
0:45:12 --> 0:45:17
It doesn't matter what level of fame or fortune the musician is

951
0:45:17 --> 0:45:17
at.

952
0:45:17 --> 0:45:20
If you give them food, they're going to be thrilled.

953
0:45:21 --> 0:45:21
Right.

954
0:45:22 --> 0:45:22
Absolutely.

955
0:45:23 --> 0:45:26
I mean, I, you know, and I mean, I, you know, I say that

956
0:45:26 --> 0:45:29
by you go to, you go to craft services, you after, after

957
0:45:29 --> 0:45:33
the, after the, uh, after the sound check and, you know,

958
0:45:34 --> 0:45:35
my bosses are down there.

959
0:45:35 --> 0:45:39
They're eating, you know, because, you know, that's

960
0:45:39 --> 0:45:39
what you do.

961
0:45:40 --> 0:45:41
I mean, it's, it's, it's the risk.

962
0:45:42 --> 0:45:44
It's the reward for a, you know, a lifetime spent

963
0:45:44 --> 0:45:45
banging on a piano.

964
0:45:45 --> 0:45:46
You get a free meal once in a while.

965
0:45:47 --> 0:45:50
If you ever want to just like please an artist, just

966
0:45:50 --> 0:45:50
feed them.

967
0:45:51 --> 0:45:53
If you just feed the artist, they will be, they

968
0:45:53 --> 0:45:54
will be so happy.

969
0:45:54 --> 0:45:56
I know I am.

970
0:45:56 --> 0:45:58
I forgot, Mike, that your, uh, that your camera

971
0:45:58 --> 0:46:01
follows you around with the, uh, with the AI thing.

972
0:46:01 --> 0:46:03
So when you just leaned over to get a drink out

973
0:46:03 --> 0:46:05
of your cup, I was really wondering why you

974
0:46:05 --> 0:46:08
were moving the camera to follow yourself to get

975
0:46:08 --> 0:46:08
that drink.

976
0:46:09 --> 0:46:10
I see, I see.

977
0:46:10 --> 0:46:10
Yeah.

978
0:46:10 --> 0:46:10
Yeah.

979
0:46:10 --> 0:46:13
I was like, man, he is really into this camera thing.

980
0:46:14 --> 0:46:15
Damn right.

981
0:46:15 --> 0:46:19
I, um, but, uh, no, it's, you know, it's, it's funny

982
0:46:19 --> 0:46:23
when I was doing gigs in, in, in, in Boston, when

983
0:46:23 --> 0:46:27
I got out of college and, uh, I did the whole

984
0:46:27 --> 0:46:27
circuit.

985
0:46:27 --> 0:46:30
Like there were 40 or 50 places in Boston that

986
0:46:30 --> 0:46:34
had live music every night from like five

987
0:46:34 --> 0:46:35
o'clock at night till nine.

988
0:46:35 --> 0:46:37
There was a shift and then nine to one.

989
0:46:37 --> 0:46:40
And I played a lot of cocktail shifts and a

990
0:46:40 --> 0:46:44
lot of night shifts and all of these places,

991
0:46:45 --> 0:46:49
their reputation among musicians was who had

992
0:46:49 --> 0:46:50
the best employee cafeteria.

993
0:46:50 --> 0:46:50
Yep.

994
0:46:51 --> 0:46:53
You know, uh, that's all we cared about.

995
0:46:54 --> 0:46:56
It's like, oh man, I got a gig next Friday

996
0:46:56 --> 0:46:59
night at the Ritz, you know, and you would go

997
0:46:59 --> 0:47:01
up to the top floor on the Ritz and the

998
0:47:01 --> 0:47:05
food up there was better than most restaurants

999
0:47:05 --> 0:47:07
for the employees, you know, and if you

1000
0:47:07 --> 0:47:10
didn't like what they were offering, they

1001
0:47:10 --> 0:47:13
would make you a burger, which at the time a

1002
0:47:13 --> 0:47:17
Ritz burger was like $20, you know, and they

1003
0:47:18 --> 0:47:20
would just make it for you and you would go

1004
0:47:20 --> 0:47:22
up there and they would have like a prime

1005
0:47:22 --> 0:47:25
rib hash that was out for the, for the, for

1006
0:47:25 --> 0:47:27
the, in the street bar that, you know, I

1007
0:47:27 --> 0:47:29
mean, this stuff was, I still think about

1008
0:47:29 --> 0:47:32
that, you know, we're talking about it.

1009
0:47:33 --> 0:47:36
Well, it's so funny and I'm going off, I'm

1010
0:47:36 --> 0:47:37
taking up your whole show.

1011
0:47:37 --> 0:47:38
Well, what the hell, why not?

1012
0:47:38 --> 0:47:39
You were stupid enough to have me.

1013
0:47:41 --> 0:47:43
I would, I would see these old musicians,

1014
0:47:43 --> 0:47:46
like guys that I worshiped when I was in

1015
0:47:46 --> 0:47:47
Boston and I got lucky enough to be friends

1016
0:47:47 --> 0:47:49
with and play with and I'd be on this

1017
0:47:49 --> 0:47:52
gig after seeing Dave McKenna, who was a

1018
0:47:52 --> 0:47:54
great jazz pianist, and I would be in a

1019
0:47:54 --> 0:47:56
room with Dave McKenna and Dick Johnson,

1020
0:47:56 --> 0:47:58
who was a great clarinetist who led

1021
0:47:58 --> 0:48:00
the Artie Shaw band and he's, these

1022
0:48:00 --> 0:48:02
guys are legendary musicians and Herb

1023
0:48:02 --> 0:48:04
Pomeray and Dick Johnson and Gray

1024
0:48:04 --> 0:48:07
Sargent and all the guys from, from

1025
0:48:07 --> 0:48:10
Boston and they all played, I mean,

1026
0:48:10 --> 0:48:12
Herb Pomeray played with Charlie Parker,

1027
0:48:12 --> 0:48:14
you know, that's the level of these

1028
0:48:14 --> 0:48:16
musicians and I'm sitting there as a 22

1029
0:48:16 --> 0:48:18
year old guy wanting to suck up all the

1030
0:48:18 --> 0:48:21
all the stories and all the energy and

1031
0:48:21 --> 0:48:22
you know what they talked about?

1032
0:48:22 --> 0:48:24
Oh, remember that diner on Route 9?

1033
0:48:25 --> 0:48:27
The fucking mashed potatoes there were

1034
0:48:27 --> 0:48:30
unbelievable, you know, and Dave

1035
0:48:30 --> 0:48:32
McKenna's like, oh, this white pizza

1036
0:48:32 --> 0:48:33
at this place in Hartford, I'd do

1037
0:48:33 --> 0:48:34
the gig just for that.

1038
0:48:35 --> 0:48:36
That's what they're talking about,

1039
0:48:36 --> 0:48:40
you know, I played with Ella Fitzgerald

1040
0:48:40 --> 0:48:42
for six nights and, you know, they don't

1041
0:48:42 --> 0:48:43
care, they're like, that's food, food,

1042
0:48:43 --> 0:48:46
food is important, that's what I've

1043
0:48:46 --> 0:48:47
learned in life.

1044
0:48:50 --> 0:48:52
Jonesy, when do you think the albums

1045
0:48:52 --> 0:48:53
are going to come out?

1046
0:48:54 --> 0:48:54
What?

1047
0:48:55 --> 0:48:56
When do you think the albums are going

1048
0:48:56 --> 0:48:56
to drop?

1049
0:48:57 --> 0:49:00
Oh, the albums? Oh, not until, I mean,

1050
0:49:00 --> 0:49:04
with Locke, you know, Spring or Summer

1051
0:49:04 --> 0:49:05
of 26.

1052
0:49:06 --> 0:49:07
Okay.

1053
0:49:07 --> 0:49:09
I mean, I'm going to push them a little

1054
0:49:09 --> 0:49:12
bit more, you know, maybe even as soon

1055
0:49:12 --> 0:49:13
as March or April for one of them.

1056
0:49:13 --> 0:49:15
I don't know if they'll do two of them

1057
0:49:15 --> 0:49:15
at the same time.

1058
0:49:16 --> 0:49:18
I don't know, you know, as I said,

1059
0:49:18 --> 0:49:22
in dealing with all of the machinations

1060
0:49:22 --> 0:49:23
to make these records,

1061
0:49:23 --> 0:49:25
Johnny Katz asked me what the title

1062
0:49:25 --> 0:49:26
was going to be, and I said,

1063
0:49:26 --> 0:49:28
we don't have them titled yet,

1064
0:49:28 --> 0:49:29
which we don't.

1065
0:49:29 --> 0:49:31
But as I said to Jen, the title

1066
0:49:31 --> 0:49:32
of the first one is going to be

1067
0:49:32 --> 0:49:33
Never Again.

1068
0:49:34 --> 0:49:36
And the title of the second one is

1069
0:49:36 --> 0:49:37
Somebody Kill Me.

1070
0:49:39 --> 0:49:41
This was your chance to see me do this.

1071
0:49:41 --> 0:49:42
I'm not doing it again.

1072
0:49:42 --> 0:49:43
Yes, exactly.

1073
0:49:43 --> 0:49:43
Title.

1074
0:49:43 --> 0:49:44
Exactly.

1075
0:49:44 --> 0:49:46
No, no, I mean, I will come up with

1076
0:49:46 --> 0:49:48
something, you know, a little bit,

1077
0:49:48 --> 0:49:49
a little bit better than Vampin'

1078
0:49:49 --> 0:49:50
at Vix.

1079
0:49:52 --> 0:49:53
Not much better.

1080
0:49:54 --> 0:49:54
Not much better.

1081
0:49:56 --> 0:49:57
Go on and see Jonesy tonight

1082
0:49:57 --> 0:49:59
at Vix, subscribe to the stereo

1083
0:49:59 --> 0:49:59
image.

1084
0:50:00 --> 0:50:00
Yeah, thank you.

1085
0:50:01 --> 0:50:01
Thank you.

1086
0:50:01 --> 0:50:01
Yes.

1087
0:50:01 --> 0:50:02
Thank you, Jonesy, for coming on

1088
0:50:02 --> 0:50:04
and chatting with us.

1089
0:50:04 --> 0:50:07
God bless you, Matt and Jacob and Paul

1090
0:50:07 --> 0:50:09
and all of the scoops out there.

1091
0:50:10 --> 0:50:12
And yes, do do whatever you want.

1092
0:50:13 --> 0:50:15
Come on out and subscribe

1093
0:50:15 --> 0:50:17
if you want to hear me talk more

1094
0:50:17 --> 0:50:20
about music with people that are

1095
0:50:20 --> 0:50:20
smarter than me.

1096
0:50:21 --> 0:50:21
There you go.

1097
0:50:22 --> 0:50:22
All right.

1098
0:50:23 --> 0:50:23
Thanks, guys.

1099
0:50:24 --> 0:50:25
Really, really appreciate it.

1100
0:50:25 --> 0:50:26
Thanks, Jonesy.

1101
0:50:27 --> 0:50:27
Bye, bye.

1102
0:50:30 --> 0:50:31
So shy.

1103
0:50:32 --> 0:50:32
Yeah, yeah.

1104
0:50:33 --> 0:50:34
It's tough to get him out of his shell.

1105
0:50:35 --> 0:50:36
One day, one day, though,

1106
0:50:37 --> 0:50:39
he's going to really start talking.

1107
0:50:39 --> 0:50:40
Retiring Violet that Jonesy.

1108
0:50:41 --> 0:50:41
Yeah.

1109
0:50:42 --> 0:50:44
He's a fascinating dude.

1110
0:50:44 --> 0:50:44
He is absolutely.

1111
0:50:44 --> 0:50:46
And that podcast is great.

1112
0:50:46 --> 0:50:47
I've listened to a couple episodes.

1113
0:50:47 --> 0:50:48
Yes.

1114
0:50:48 --> 0:50:50
He gets deep with some of his guests.

1115
0:50:51 --> 0:50:52
Yeah, yeah.

1116
0:50:52 --> 0:50:53
Well, they're talking about like

1117
0:50:53 --> 0:50:54
a personal relationship with music,

1118
0:50:54 --> 0:50:56
which is always, it's always going

1119
0:50:56 --> 0:50:57
to be fascinating.

1120
0:50:57 --> 0:50:58
And then you add knowledge into it

1121
0:50:58 --> 0:50:59
on top of it.

1122
0:50:59 --> 0:51:00
And it's, it's a, it's a really,

1123
0:51:00 --> 0:51:01
it's a really great thing.

1124
0:51:01 --> 0:51:03
Coming from a very educated place.

1125
0:51:03 --> 0:51:03
Yeah.

1126
0:51:05 --> 0:51:07
Well, I had a Scoopity hero picked out

1127
0:51:07 --> 0:51:09
because Jonesy was with us.

1128
0:51:09 --> 0:51:09
He's gone now.

1129
0:51:10 --> 0:51:10
We're going to play it anyway.

1130
0:51:11 --> 0:51:12
Here comes a Scoopity.

1131
0:51:15 --> 0:51:19
Ladies and gentlemen, it is.

1132
0:51:40 --> 0:51:41
We got a Scoopity coming to us today

1133
0:51:41 --> 0:51:43
from the OG Scoop.

1134
0:51:44 --> 0:51:45
The categories are

1135
0:51:45 --> 0:51:46
rock with strings,

1136
0:51:47 --> 0:51:48
bond theme artists

1137
0:51:48 --> 0:51:49
from Broadway to pop

1138
0:51:49 --> 0:51:51
and old ass songs.

1139
0:51:51 --> 0:51:51
That's right.

1140
0:51:51 --> 0:51:53
It's a music Scoopity.

1141
0:51:53 --> 0:51:54
Oh, I'm first.

1142
0:51:54 --> 0:51:55
Well, I'll start top left corner.

1143
0:51:56 --> 0:51:57
Rock with strings for 200.

1144
0:51:57 --> 0:51:59
Kansas basically says

1145
0:51:59 --> 0:52:02
we are all dirt in this 70s classic.

1146
0:52:06 --> 0:52:08
It's the shit.

1147
0:52:09 --> 0:52:10
The name of the song.

1148
0:52:10 --> 0:52:10
Dust of the Wind.

1149
0:52:10 --> 0:52:11
Horse with no name.

1150
0:52:12 --> 0:52:13
Horse with no name.

1151
0:52:14 --> 0:52:16
Dust of the Wind is it.

1152
0:52:17 --> 0:52:17
Matt, you're up.

1153
0:52:19 --> 0:52:21
I'll do rock with strings for 400.

1154
0:52:22 --> 0:52:23
Let's see here.

1155
0:52:24 --> 0:52:26
This moody blues song

1156
0:52:26 --> 0:52:27
speaks of written letters

1157
0:52:27 --> 0:52:29
that were never meant to be sent.

1158
0:52:35 --> 0:52:37
Knights and white satin.

1159
0:52:37 --> 0:52:37
I think so.

1160
0:52:38 --> 0:52:38
All right.

1161
0:52:39 --> 0:52:40
That's a white satin.

1162
0:52:40 --> 0:52:41
Knights and white satin.

1163
0:52:43 --> 0:52:44
Letters I've written

1164
0:52:45 --> 0:52:46
never meant to be sent.

1165
0:52:51 --> 0:52:53
I'll do rock with strings for 800.

1166
0:52:53 --> 0:52:53
Let's go.

1167
0:52:53 --> 0:52:55
Whoa, skip it over.

1168
0:52:55 --> 0:52:57
This Zeppelin song name

1169
0:52:57 --> 0:52:59
drops a region of the Indian subcontinent.

1170
0:53:02 --> 0:53:03
Yeah, you're glad you skipped over

1171
0:53:03 --> 0:53:05
the $800 question now, aren't you?

1172
0:53:06 --> 0:53:07
Cashmere, I think.

1173
0:53:08 --> 0:53:09
Let's try it.

1174
0:53:10 --> 0:53:11
It's cashmere.

1175
0:53:11 --> 0:53:12
Damn it.

1176
0:53:14 --> 0:53:15
See, I always thought it was

1177
0:53:15 --> 0:53:19
referring to Ed Wood's sweaters,

1178
0:53:19 --> 0:53:20
but I guess I was wrong.

1179
0:53:20 --> 0:53:22
You thought Zeppelin made it.

1180
0:53:24 --> 0:53:25
He played all the coffee houses

1181
0:53:25 --> 0:53:26
when I was coming up.

1182
0:53:27 --> 0:53:28
As the 90s, there's a lot of coffee houses.

1183
0:53:30 --> 0:53:32
Scott Hathaway would mic his guitar

1184
0:53:33 --> 0:53:34
super all over the place,

1185
0:53:35 --> 0:53:36
and he would play cashmere

1186
0:53:36 --> 0:53:39
by wearing a jangly bracelet,

1187
0:53:40 --> 0:53:41
hitting certain guitar strings,

1188
0:53:41 --> 0:53:42
and playing the drums

1189
0:53:42 --> 0:53:43
on the bottom of the guitar.

1190
0:53:44 --> 0:53:44
It was insane.

1191
0:53:44 --> 0:53:44
Yeah, yeah.

1192
0:53:45 --> 0:53:46
It was a little...

1193
0:53:46 --> 0:53:47
I've seen people do that.

1194
0:53:47 --> 0:53:48
It's a little one-man bandy.

1195
0:53:49 --> 0:53:52
Yeah, and my son,

1196
0:53:52 --> 0:53:53
my youngest son brought up

1197
0:53:53 --> 0:53:55
a clip of someone doing that

1198
0:53:55 --> 0:53:56
who was younger and doing it,

1199
0:53:57 --> 0:53:59
and I, as proud dad moment,

1200
0:54:00 --> 0:54:01
bit my tongue and didn't say,

1201
0:54:02 --> 0:54:02
I know someone who did that

1202
0:54:02 --> 0:54:03
when I was young also.

1203
0:54:04 --> 0:54:05
I just let him appreciate

1204
0:54:05 --> 0:54:06
the new young guy doing it

1205
0:54:06 --> 0:54:06
for the first time.

1206
0:54:06 --> 0:54:07
Smart, smart.

1207
0:54:07 --> 0:54:07
You know, for the first time.

1208
0:54:07 --> 0:54:07
Smart.

1209
0:54:08 --> 0:54:10
And I was like, yep.

1210
0:54:10 --> 0:54:10
That's awesome.

1211
0:54:10 --> 0:54:11
Way to find that.

1212
0:54:11 --> 0:54:12
Way to discover that.

1213
0:54:12 --> 0:54:14
Way to discover this brand new thing.

1214
0:54:15 --> 0:54:16
No one has done before.

1215
0:54:17 --> 0:54:18
Yeah.

1216
0:54:18 --> 0:54:19
I'll say it's me.

1217
0:54:19 --> 0:54:22
I'll try an old-ass song.

1218
0:54:22 --> 0:54:22
It's 200.

1219
0:54:23 --> 0:54:25
This Queen song is almost always

1220
0:54:25 --> 0:54:27
played with their song Bicycle Race.

1221
0:54:29 --> 0:54:31
Which one do they play with Bicycle Race?

1222
0:54:37 --> 0:54:38
I'm going to feel really dumb here in a second.

1223
0:54:38 --> 0:54:39
I'm going to pass.

1224
0:54:39 --> 0:54:39
Matt.

1225
0:54:40 --> 0:54:41
I think it's Fat Bottom Girls.

1226
0:54:42 --> 0:54:42
Is it?

1227
0:54:42 --> 0:54:43
All right, let's try it.

1228
0:54:43 --> 0:54:44
It is Fat Bottom Girls.

1229
0:54:45 --> 0:54:45
Look at that.

1230
0:54:46 --> 0:54:46
Yeah.

1231
0:54:47 --> 0:54:47
Matt.

1232
0:54:47 --> 0:54:48
Miss, I always play them together.

1233
0:54:49 --> 0:54:49
Smart.

1234
0:54:51 --> 0:54:52
I will do...

1235
0:54:54 --> 0:54:57
Let's go from Broadway to pop.

1236
0:54:58 --> 0:54:59
Daily Double!

1237
0:55:04 --> 0:55:09
Yvonne Ellman had this hit from Jesus Christ Superstar.

1238
0:55:11 --> 0:55:13
Go get Jesus and hang him on the cross.

1239
0:55:17 --> 0:55:20
What's the hit from Jesus Christ Superstar?

1240
0:55:20 --> 0:55:20
Oh, there's a random.

1241
0:55:20 --> 0:55:23
I need this problem like I need a hole in my hand.

1242
0:55:29 --> 0:55:31
So I can't get the fuck down.

1243
0:55:31 --> 0:55:32
Someone needs the wood.

1244
0:55:36 --> 0:55:40
I'm going to shroud up Turin all over your face.

1245
0:55:43 --> 0:55:45
Man, it's a Daily Double, so I have to guess.

1246
0:55:45 --> 0:55:45
It is.

1247
0:55:46 --> 0:55:46
Let's see.

1248
0:55:47 --> 0:55:48
Jesus Christ Superstar.

1249
0:55:49 --> 0:55:50
It's got all the Judas songs.

1250
0:55:50 --> 0:55:51
Creepers, creepers.

1251
0:55:51 --> 0:55:53
Where'd you get those peepers?

1252
0:55:53 --> 0:55:53
Sure, yeah.

1253
0:55:57 --> 0:55:58
Creepers, creepers.

1254
0:55:58 --> 0:55:59
Where'd you get those eyes?

1255
0:55:59 --> 0:56:00
Rubba dub dub.

1256
0:56:00 --> 0:56:03
I was washing my feet in the tub.

1257
0:56:03 --> 0:56:04
Yep.

1258
0:56:06 --> 0:56:07
One, two, three, four.

1259
0:56:08 --> 0:56:08
It's Jesus.

1260
0:56:09 --> 0:56:10
Five, six, seven.

1261
0:56:10 --> 0:56:11
Eight o'clock.

1262
0:56:11 --> 0:56:11
It's Jesus.

1263
0:56:14 --> 0:56:16
I'll just say Jesus Christ Superstar is the hit.

1264
0:56:16 --> 0:56:16
There you go.

1265
0:56:17 --> 0:56:17
Let's try it.

1266
0:56:18 --> 0:56:20
I don't know how to love him.

1267
0:56:21 --> 0:56:22
I don't know how to...

1268
0:56:22 --> 0:56:23
I'll also let's play the game.

1269
0:56:23 --> 0:56:24
I don't know how to love him.

1270
0:56:24 --> 0:56:25
It's also what the answer to this.

1271
0:56:28 --> 0:56:29
Paul, you're up.

1272
0:56:30 --> 0:56:32
I will also try from Broadway to pop.

1273
0:56:33 --> 0:56:34
Let's try it.

1274
0:56:34 --> 0:56:38
This Wicked song was inescapable in the early 2000s.

1275
0:56:39 --> 0:56:40
It gotta be.

1276
0:56:40 --> 0:56:41
I believe it's Let It Go.

1277
0:56:41 --> 0:56:43
No, it got me defying gravity.

1278
0:56:45 --> 0:56:46
No, I'm sorry, Paul.

1279
0:56:47 --> 0:56:47
It was Letting Go.

1280
0:56:48 --> 0:56:50
Letting Go from Wicked.

1281
0:56:52 --> 0:56:53
I have green skin.

1282
0:56:53 --> 0:56:54
Please don't eat the green snow.

1283
0:56:57 --> 0:56:57
I'll try.

1284
0:56:58 --> 0:56:58
Let's see.

1285
0:56:59 --> 0:56:59
Broadway to pop, 600.

1286
0:57:00 --> 0:57:01
Oh, shit.

1287
0:57:01 --> 0:57:01
I did the wrong thing.

1288
0:57:02 --> 0:57:02
I did old-ass songs.

1289
0:57:03 --> 0:57:05
According to Trace Atkins, the subject of this song

1290
0:57:05 --> 0:57:08
has got it going on like Donkey Kong.

1291
0:57:09 --> 0:57:13
Oh, you know, for a second, I thought I wasn't going to know

1292
0:57:13 --> 0:57:16
the answer to the question that I accidentally clicked on for myself.

1293
0:57:16 --> 0:57:17
Now you do that.

1294
0:57:17 --> 0:57:20
Fortunately, fortunately, it's the song that is my wake-up tone.

1295
0:57:20 --> 0:57:23
It plays on my alarm every morning.

1296
0:57:23 --> 0:57:25
I listen to it before I go to bed at night.

1297
0:57:25 --> 0:57:29
It is, of course, honky-tonk, but donk-a-donk.

1298
0:57:29 --> 0:57:29
Correct.

1299
0:57:30 --> 0:57:30
Yes.

1300
0:57:32 --> 0:57:33
Matt, you're up.

1301
0:57:34 --> 0:57:37
By the way, that was from old-ass songs, not from Broadway to pop.

1302
0:57:38 --> 0:57:39
Oh, good.

1303
0:57:39 --> 0:57:40
I would hope.

1304
0:57:41 --> 0:57:43
Rock with strings for 600, please.

1305
0:57:44 --> 0:57:47
ELO added strings to this amazing cover of a Chuck Berry tune.

1306
0:57:53 --> 0:57:53
I don't know.

1307
0:57:53 --> 0:57:54
Pass.

1308
0:57:55 --> 0:57:55
Paul.

1309
0:57:59 --> 0:58:00
Well, goodness.

1310
0:58:00 --> 0:58:01
I think this is also let it go.

1311
0:58:02 --> 0:58:03
It could be my dingaling.

1312
0:58:06 --> 0:58:08
It's the string version of my dingaling.

1313
0:58:09 --> 0:58:11
Well, Silver Bell's hanging out his string.

1314
0:58:12 --> 0:58:13
I'll pass.

1315
0:58:14 --> 0:58:15
Oh, that passes to me.

1316
0:58:15 --> 0:58:15
I don't know.

1317
0:58:15 --> 0:58:16
I'll pass.

1318
0:58:18 --> 0:58:19
Roll over Beethoven.

1319
0:58:20 --> 0:58:21
Roll over Beethoven.

1320
0:58:21 --> 0:58:23
I've never heard the ELO version of that.

1321
0:58:23 --> 0:58:24
I don't think I have either.

1322
0:58:25 --> 0:58:26
Paul, you're up.

1323
0:58:26 --> 0:58:27
Tchaikovsky, the news.

1324
0:58:27 --> 0:58:28
Broadway to pop, please.

1325
0:58:29 --> 0:58:30
A first-sex hundo.

1326
0:58:31 --> 0:58:36
Susan Boyle's shocked judges on Britain's Got Talent with this song from Lemis Robles.

1327
0:58:37 --> 0:58:37
Uh.

1328
0:58:37 --> 0:58:38
Lemis Robles.

1329
0:58:39 --> 0:58:40
Lemis Robles.

1330
0:58:40 --> 0:58:41
Me if you don't believe.

1331
0:58:42 --> 0:58:48
It was, uh, I don't know how to love it.

1332
0:58:48 --> 0:58:51
It was a castle on a cloud.

1333
0:58:51 --> 0:58:51
Yeah, right.

1334
0:58:51 --> 0:58:53
That's my favorite, but I ain't doing that anymore.

1335
0:58:53 --> 0:58:56
This is the song that I sang.

1336
0:58:58 --> 0:58:59
Oh, is it?

1337
0:58:59 --> 0:58:59
No, it's not.

1338
0:58:59 --> 0:59:00
Keeper of the Zoo.

1339
0:59:01 --> 0:59:02
Not where is love.

1340
0:59:04 --> 0:59:06
Uh, what's love got to do?

1341
0:59:06 --> 0:59:06
Oliver.

1342
0:59:06 --> 0:59:07
Got to do with it.

1343
0:59:07 --> 0:59:09
Where is love is from Oliver?

1344
0:59:09 --> 0:59:10
Uh, shit.

1345
0:59:10 --> 0:59:11
What is this one?

1346
0:59:12 --> 0:59:13
Please, sir, can I ask some more?

1347
0:59:14 --> 0:59:14
I have to pass.

1348
0:59:14 --> 0:59:14
I don't know.

1349
0:59:15 --> 0:59:16
Uh, it passes to me.

1350
0:59:17 --> 0:59:17
What is it?

1351
0:59:17 --> 0:59:18
What did she sing from Britain?

1352
0:59:19 --> 0:59:19
Yeah, I don't remember.

1353
0:59:21 --> 0:59:22
Well, that's the whole question, isn't it?

1354
0:59:22 --> 0:59:25
Um, the master of the house.

1355
0:59:25 --> 0:59:29
This is not the song that she would have sung on the talent show.

1356
0:59:29 --> 0:59:31
It's not the I'm John Valjean song.

1357
0:59:31 --> 0:59:33
It's probably not on John Valjean.

1358
0:59:33 --> 0:59:34
No, it's probably not.

1359
0:59:34 --> 0:59:35
Yeah, it's probably not.

1360
0:59:35 --> 0:59:36
Oh, my.

1361
0:59:37 --> 0:59:40
I'm Susan Boyle.

1362
0:59:40 --> 0:59:41
Oh, that'd be great.

1363
0:59:42 --> 0:59:43
That is so great.

1364
0:59:46 --> 0:59:48
Um, it fits the meter.

1365
0:59:49 --> 0:59:51
Empty chairs at empty tables.

1366
0:59:51 --> 0:59:52
That doesn't feel right.

1367
0:59:52 --> 0:59:53
Oh, my God, dude.

1368
0:59:54 --> 0:59:56
Have you heard the empty chairs at empty tables?

1369
0:59:57 --> 0:59:58
Muppets mash up.

1370
0:59:59 --> 1:00:00
No, no, Christ.

1371
1:00:01 --> 1:00:02
The Muppets did they miss it?

1372
1:00:02 --> 1:00:04
No, it just fits to.

1373
1:00:05 --> 1:00:08
It fits perfectly with the Muppet show intro.

1374
1:00:09 --> 1:00:11
And it's just as haunting and tragic.

1375
1:00:13 --> 1:00:14
That's great.

1376
1:00:15 --> 1:00:16
All right, I have to look for it or send it to me.

1377
1:00:17 --> 1:00:17
I will.

1378
1:00:17 --> 1:00:18
Why am I looking for it?

1379
1:00:18 --> 1:00:19
You send it to me.

1380
1:00:19 --> 1:00:21
Um, I don't, I got to pass.

1381
1:00:21 --> 1:00:21
Matt.

1382
1:00:23 --> 1:00:24
It's a dream of dream.

1383
1:00:24 --> 1:00:27
Oh, it's the only song I couldn't think of from lay this.

1384
1:00:27 --> 1:00:28
Yeah, I couldn't remember it myself.

1385
1:00:29 --> 1:00:30
Matt just knew it.

1386
1:00:30 --> 1:00:30
Yeah.

1387
1:00:31 --> 1:00:32
Uh, it's me.

1388
1:00:32 --> 1:00:32
I'll try.

1389
1:00:32 --> 1:00:33
I'll close up.

1390
1:00:33 --> 1:00:35
Pop Broadway 800 or Broadway to pop.

1391
1:00:35 --> 1:00:35
You know what I mean?

1392
1:00:36 --> 1:00:39
Abba songwriters, Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ylvisis,

1393
1:00:39 --> 1:00:42
along with Tim Rice, pinned this tune from chess.

1394
1:00:44 --> 1:00:48
I had no idea that anybody from Abba worked on chess,

1395
1:00:48 --> 1:00:48
so I'm going to pass.

1396
1:00:49 --> 1:00:50
Matt.

1397
1:00:55 --> 1:00:57
Shoot, my wife loves chess.

1398
1:00:57 --> 1:01:00
Everyone loves the soundtrack to chess and no one loves the show.

1399
1:01:00 --> 1:01:01
That's exactly right.

1400
1:01:02 --> 1:01:03
Um, I mean, this is the one hit.

1401
1:01:04 --> 1:01:04
I got it.

1402
1:01:04 --> 1:01:05
You got it.

1403
1:01:06 --> 1:01:08
It's a one night in Bangkok.

1404
1:01:11 --> 1:01:12
That's what you're going with?

1405
1:01:12 --> 1:01:13
Yeah.

1406
1:01:14 --> 1:01:15
It's one night in Bangkok.

1407
1:01:15 --> 1:01:16
Yeah.

1408
1:01:16 --> 1:01:17
That's just right.

1409
1:01:17 --> 1:01:19
It's the only song there is in chess to have made of hit.

1410
1:01:20 --> 1:01:21
I don't know.

1411
1:01:21 --> 1:01:21
I don't know.

1412
1:01:21 --> 1:01:21
I don't know.

1413
1:01:21 --> 1:01:22
I don't know any songs to chess.

1414
1:01:22 --> 1:01:23
It's a man playing chess.

1415
1:01:25 --> 1:01:26
I don't know.

1416
1:01:26 --> 1:01:27
You're right.

1417
1:01:27 --> 1:01:29
I don't know why.

1418
1:01:29 --> 1:01:30
I need more credit.

1419
1:01:30 --> 1:01:30
More credit.

1420
1:01:31 --> 1:01:32
Paul's right.

1421
1:01:33 --> 1:01:35
Paul's right, everyone.

1422
1:01:35 --> 1:01:38
One night in Bangkok and your cock gets banged on.

1423
1:01:40 --> 1:01:43
Um, Matt, you got Bond theme artists or old ass songs.

1424
1:01:43 --> 1:01:44
What you want?

1425
1:01:45 --> 1:01:47
Hand me that hammer gun.

1426
1:01:47 --> 1:01:48
I'm going to bang some cock.

1427
1:01:50 --> 1:01:53
For one night.

1428
1:01:54 --> 1:01:56
Bangkok, Oriental city where you have to bring your hammer

1429
1:01:56 --> 1:01:57
because hammers ain't cheap.

1430
1:01:58 --> 1:02:01
How about an old ass song?

1431
1:02:04 --> 1:02:06
Bring your hammer and disinfect it because you're going to be

1432
1:02:06 --> 1:02:08
banging on your cock all night.

1433
1:02:09 --> 1:02:13
Casey and the Sunshine Band got scores of us to do this in the 70s.

1434
1:02:14 --> 1:02:16
Have unprotected sex.

1435
1:02:19 --> 1:02:21
Oh, Casey and the Sunshine Band.

1436
1:02:21 --> 1:02:23
There's several possible answers here.

1437
1:02:23 --> 1:02:25
There's several possible answers here.

1438
1:02:25 --> 1:02:25
I think it's good.

1439
1:02:27 --> 1:02:30
Two little dance and make a little love get down tonight or let's try it.

1440
1:02:30 --> 1:02:33
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

1441
1:02:33 --> 1:02:34
Oh shoot.

1442
1:02:34 --> 1:02:35
It's going to be that.

1443
1:02:35 --> 1:02:36
It's going to be that.

1444
1:02:38 --> 1:02:39
What is it, Matt?

1445
1:02:39 --> 1:02:39
What's your final answer?

1446
1:02:40 --> 1:02:40
You got to pick one.

1447
1:02:43 --> 1:02:45
Your answer fits better to a question than mine does.

1448
1:02:45 --> 1:02:47
I think that's why I went there is shake your booty.

1449
1:02:48 --> 1:02:49
You see you're going to shake your booty?

1450
1:02:49 --> 1:02:49
Yeah, shake your booty.

1451
1:02:49 --> 1:02:50
Let's try it.

1452
1:02:50 --> 1:02:53
It is shake, shake, shake, shake your booty.

1453
1:02:54 --> 1:02:54
There we go.

1454
1:02:55 --> 1:02:56
Way to go, Matt.

1455
1:02:56 --> 1:02:57
You and your booty.

1456
1:02:57 --> 1:02:57
Get that right.

1457
1:02:57 --> 1:02:58
Paul.

1458
1:02:59 --> 1:02:59
Phew.

1459
1:03:01 --> 1:03:02
Bond theme artist.

1460
1:03:03 --> 1:03:03
What the hell?

1461
1:03:04 --> 1:03:04
Let's see.

1462
1:03:05 --> 1:03:09
A singer of nobody does it better from the spy who loved me.

1463
1:03:12 --> 1:03:14
I think that's Eartha Kitt.

1464
1:03:15 --> 1:03:16
Let's try it.

1465
1:03:16 --> 1:03:16
Eartha Kitt.

1466
1:03:17 --> 1:03:18
Carly Simon.

1467
1:03:18 --> 1:03:19
Shit on me.

1468
1:03:19 --> 1:03:21
The Eartha Kitt of James Bond music.

1469
1:03:23 --> 1:03:25
The Carly Simon of Eartha Kitt.

1470
1:03:27 --> 1:03:27
It's me.

1471
1:03:28 --> 1:03:29
I'll close out old ass songs for 400.

1472
1:03:30 --> 1:03:36
Sir Mixolot's favorite body part of the opposite sex is obvious from this song.

1473
1:03:37 --> 1:03:41
I believe it's my humps, my hulumps, my lovely lady lumps.

1474
1:03:43 --> 1:03:44
My Sir Mixolot.

1475
1:03:45 --> 1:03:48
That would be the butt song.

1476
1:03:48 --> 1:03:49
Baby got back.

1477
1:03:50 --> 1:03:51
Yeah, there it is.

1478
1:03:54 --> 1:03:57
Matt, you got Bond theme artist for four, six, or eight.

1479
1:03:59 --> 1:04:05
I had to really shuffle through all of the Sir Mixolot hits in my brain to get to that one.

1480
1:04:06 --> 1:04:07
I'll go.

1481
1:04:08 --> 1:04:09
Did Mixolot do one of the Bond things?

1482
1:04:10 --> 1:04:11
He did.

1483
1:04:11 --> 1:04:12
Under a suit in him though.

1484
1:04:13 --> 1:04:14
Oh yeah, score check.

1485
1:04:14 --> 1:04:15
Paul has 1800.

1486
1:04:15 --> 1:04:16
Matt has 1400.

1487
1:04:16 --> 1:04:17
I have 1200.

1488
1:04:18 --> 1:04:22
I think there's a daily double left as well in one of these three questions.

1489
1:04:22 --> 1:04:24
I like James Bond and I cannot lie.

1490
1:04:25 --> 1:04:26
You other spies can't deny.

1491
1:04:29 --> 1:04:34
When a guy rolls in with a car with tricks and shoots somebody from the roof.

1492
1:04:34 --> 1:04:35
It's James Bond's car.

1493
1:04:39 --> 1:04:42
Um, all right, this is Bond theme artist for 400.

1494
1:04:42 --> 1:04:43
Let's see it.

1495
1:04:43 --> 1:04:48
Not Guns and Roses, but this group recorded the soundtrack theme from Live and Let Die First.

1496
1:04:51 --> 1:04:53
That'd be Big Buckethead.

1497
1:04:53 --> 1:04:55
Big Buckethead, of course.

1498
1:04:57 --> 1:04:58
What was the name of that group?

1499
1:04:59 --> 1:04:59
Paul McCartney, but do I have to?

1500
1:05:00 --> 1:05:01
But it was a group?

1501
1:05:02 --> 1:05:03
Yeah, it's a band.

1502
1:05:03 --> 1:05:03
Oh, Wings.

1503
1:05:04 --> 1:05:05
Wings, there you go.

1504
1:05:06 --> 1:05:07
Paul McCartney and Wings.

1505
1:05:09 --> 1:05:12
Paul, you got theme artists for six or 800.

1506
1:05:13 --> 1:05:15
You're currently tied with Matt at 1800.

1507
1:05:17 --> 1:05:17
Yeah.

1508
1:05:17 --> 1:05:20
Uh, yeah, I'll go 800.

1509
1:05:21 --> 1:05:21
800.

1510
1:05:21 --> 1:05:21
Let's go.

1511
1:05:22 --> 1:05:22
Let's go.

1512
1:05:22 --> 1:05:23
800.

1513
1:05:23 --> 1:05:23
Yeah.

1514
1:05:23 --> 1:05:25
It's the Daily Double.

1515
1:05:25 --> 1:05:25
I knew it.

1516
1:05:26 --> 1:05:26
I knew it.

1517
1:05:26 --> 1:05:28
Now it's for 1800.

1518
1:05:28 --> 1:05:30
But I had to do this.

1519
1:05:30 --> 1:05:31
You had to.

1520
1:05:31 --> 1:05:32
I did.

1521
1:05:32 --> 1:05:38
In my opinion, this Goldfinger theme singer started the tradition of epic Bond songs.

1522
1:05:39 --> 1:05:41
If that's your opinion, OG Scoop, you're correct.

1523
1:05:43 --> 1:05:45
I think this is Eartha Kitt.

1524
1:05:46 --> 1:05:48
Oh, it is not.

1525
1:05:48 --> 1:05:49
Oh, fuck me.

1526
1:05:49 --> 1:05:50
It is Shirley Bassey.

1527
1:05:50 --> 1:05:51
My ass.

1528
1:05:52 --> 1:05:53
Shirley Bassey.

1529
1:05:53 --> 1:05:54
My ass.

1530
1:05:55 --> 1:05:57
Oh, I clicked the wrong thing.

1531
1:05:57 --> 1:05:58
I clicked it.

1532
1:05:58 --> 1:05:59
Paul got it right, which he definitely did not.

1533
1:06:01 --> 1:06:02
Bond theme artists for 600.

1534
1:06:03 --> 1:06:04
That's what I'm closing it out with.

1535
1:06:05 --> 1:06:09
This R&B Diva legend graced us all with the theme from license to kill.

1536
1:06:09 --> 1:06:11
This was, of course, Eartha Kitt.

1537
1:06:13 --> 1:06:13
It's not.

1538
1:06:14 --> 1:06:14
It's Gladys Knight.

1539
1:06:17 --> 1:06:18
That's the game.

1540
1:06:18 --> 1:06:19
Did Eartha Kitt do a Bond song?

1541
1:06:20 --> 1:06:20
I don't think so.

1542
1:06:20 --> 1:06:22
No. That's the game.

1543
1:06:23 --> 1:06:25
Matt wins with 1,800 points.

1544
1:06:25 --> 1:06:27
I'm in second with 600 points.

1545
1:06:27 --> 1:06:29
Paul is in third with zero points.

1546
1:06:29 --> 1:06:31
Not according to the scoreboard, though.

1547
1:06:31 --> 1:06:34
According to the scoreboard, Paul crushed us with 3,600 points.

1548
1:06:34 --> 1:06:36
And that's from OG Scoop.

1549
1:06:36 --> 1:06:37
Thank you, OG Scoop.

1550
1:06:38 --> 1:06:41
Because everyone knows Shirley Bassey was literally just Eartha Kitt.

1551
1:06:42 --> 1:06:43
She was.

1552
1:06:43 --> 1:06:43
So there you go.

1553
1:06:44 --> 1:06:48
It was three Shirley Bassey's in a trench coat dressed up as Eartha Kitt.

1554
1:06:49 --> 1:06:53
So do we have time for me to share my winter stories for you?

1555
1:06:53 --> 1:06:54
Well, tell us, Paul.

1556
1:06:55 --> 1:06:55
Tell us.

1557
1:06:55 --> 1:06:56
Oh, let me tell you people this.

1558
1:06:56 --> 1:06:59
If you want to send us a Scoopity, a Price of Scrape,

1559
1:06:59 --> 1:07:03
Jock vs. Nerd, any kind of Jock vs. Nerd, or an email, heyscoops.com.

1560
1:07:03 --> 1:07:04
That's where you can go.

1561
1:07:04 --> 1:07:07
Send us all those things right over there at heyscoops.com.

1562
1:07:08 --> 1:07:10
Paul, do you have a Tale of Winter?

1563
1:07:10 --> 1:07:11
I have a couple.

1564
1:07:11 --> 1:07:13
So it's colder in witches' tit in a brass bra out here.

1565
1:07:14 --> 1:07:14
It's freezing.

1566
1:07:14 --> 1:07:18
And we got our first significant snow the other day.

1567
1:07:19 --> 1:07:21
And it happened between my improv classes.

1568
1:07:22 --> 1:07:25
So one improv class I went to on Monday, no problem.

1569
1:07:25 --> 1:07:27
Tuesday, a little more treacherous.

1570
1:07:28 --> 1:07:31
The roads are pretty fine because out here they know how to deal with snow.

1571
1:07:31 --> 1:07:34
They plow and they salt, and it's all good.

1572
1:07:34 --> 1:07:36
So the roads are not a problem.

1573
1:07:36 --> 1:07:40
They plow, they salt, they plow, they salt, plow and salt, salt and plow.

1574
1:07:41 --> 1:07:42
You may remember.

1575
1:07:42 --> 1:07:44
Just fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1576
1:07:44 --> 1:07:47
You may remember outside of the Skit Theatre area,

1577
1:07:47 --> 1:07:50
there is a large section of stairs.

1578
1:07:51 --> 1:07:52
Do you recall these stairs?

1579
1:07:52 --> 1:07:53
Oh yes, right.

1580
1:07:53 --> 1:07:53
Okay.

1581
1:07:54 --> 1:07:57
Well, I came upon those stairs on my second night,

1582
1:07:57 --> 1:07:59
not thinking anything of it really.

1583
1:08:00 --> 1:08:05
They looked trot upon, but they didn't look like they weren't snowy.

1584
1:08:05 --> 1:08:06
So I thought, okay, we're fine.

1585
1:08:07 --> 1:08:10
Well, it had gotten to about 35 degrees that day.

1586
1:08:10 --> 1:08:11
Okay.

1587
1:08:11 --> 1:08:15
Then by the time I got to the stairs, it was back down to about 30.

1588
1:08:16 --> 1:08:20
And so the stairs were basically covered in black ice.

1589
1:08:21 --> 1:08:23
I took my first step onto that stairs.

1590
1:08:24 --> 1:08:26
My feet went out from under me.

1591
1:08:26 --> 1:08:28
I was lucky to have hold of the handrail.

1592
1:08:29 --> 1:08:37
I swampled, I didn't fall, I swampled down to my ass onto these frozen stairs.

1593
1:08:37 --> 1:08:40
And I could not get my feet under me for the life of me.

1594
1:08:40 --> 1:08:41
Oh no.

1595
1:08:41 --> 1:08:48
So I scooted on my ass down 15 stairs all the way down on ice.

1596
1:08:49 --> 1:08:52
And my butt was just soaking wet for the rest of class.

1597
1:08:53 --> 1:08:53
It was disgusting.

1598
1:08:55 --> 1:08:59
And in my terror of my near-death experience,

1599
1:08:59 --> 1:09:01
I quickly texted Justin.

1600
1:09:01 --> 1:09:03
I'm like, oh my God, I almost died on the stairs.

1601
1:09:04 --> 1:09:05
You have to tell everybody.

1602
1:09:05 --> 1:09:06
Send emails out.

1603
1:09:06 --> 1:09:08
Someone could really get hurt.

1604
1:09:08 --> 1:09:10
I must have freaked him out.

1605
1:09:12 --> 1:09:13
I was in such a tizzy.

1606
1:09:14 --> 1:09:15
I was in such a tizzy.

1607
1:09:15 --> 1:09:17
You do get in tizzies.

1608
1:09:17 --> 1:09:18
It's bad.

1609
1:09:18 --> 1:09:22
Then last night, it's getting down to 11.

1610
1:09:23 --> 1:09:26
And Anne suddenly remembers, oh, shit.

1611
1:09:27 --> 1:09:31
We don't have the external hose hookup covered for the winter.

1612
1:09:31 --> 1:09:33
And we didn't turn the water off.

1613
1:09:33 --> 1:09:35
That could lead to frozen pipes.

1614
1:09:35 --> 1:09:35
That's not a good thing.

1615
1:09:36 --> 1:09:37
So she turns.

1616
1:09:38 --> 1:09:42
So she remembers this last night at 9 o'clock PM,

1617
1:09:42 --> 1:09:45
when I've been asleep for almost an hour and a half.

1618
1:09:46 --> 1:09:51
And so she wakes me up from a dead sleep to tell me, oh, God,

1619
1:09:51 --> 1:09:53
we've got to get this thing fixed.

1620
1:09:54 --> 1:09:55
Where is this?

1621
1:09:55 --> 1:09:57
She's got like a glove for the pipe.

1622
1:09:57 --> 1:09:58
She's like, where's the glove?

1623
1:09:58 --> 1:09:59
I don't know.

1624
1:09:59 --> 1:10:01
I have no idea where the glove is.

1625
1:10:01 --> 1:10:04
It got removed in the spring when she started doing watering stuff

1626
1:10:04 --> 1:10:06
and it hasn't been replaced.

1627
1:10:06 --> 1:10:07
And I don't know where the fuck it is.

1628
1:10:09 --> 1:10:15
But I managed to go get some pool noodle because I have spare pool

1629
1:10:15 --> 1:10:19
noodle around for such an emergency, cut up some pool noodle,

1630
1:10:19 --> 1:10:23
fashioned a crude glove, if you will, for the external piece.

1631
1:10:24 --> 1:10:26
And we duct taped it up and there you go.

1632
1:10:26 --> 1:10:27
All fixed.

1633
1:10:28 --> 1:10:31
Then I turn around and she is back in bed.

1634
1:10:32 --> 1:10:33
Meanwhile, I'm up.

1635
1:10:33 --> 1:10:39
And I was beside myself that she had been able to go right back

1636
1:10:39 --> 1:10:43
to bed after that so quickly and left me to fiddle with the dogs.

1637
1:10:43 --> 1:10:44
It was really funny to me.

1638
1:10:45 --> 1:10:51
But then this morning I get the call that she got her karmic

1639
1:10:51 --> 1:10:53
comeuppance for waking me in the night.

1640
1:10:53 --> 1:10:55
Oh, good.

1641
1:10:55 --> 1:10:57
It's about time she learns a lesson.

1642
1:10:57 --> 1:10:59
No, this is tragedy.

1643
1:11:00 --> 1:11:01
This is tragedy.

1644
1:11:02 --> 1:11:06
She she's drinking her coffee this morning that she's made out

1645
1:11:06 --> 1:11:10
of her little machine and the coffee is off.

1646
1:11:11 --> 1:11:11
Right.

1647
1:11:12 --> 1:11:13
It's off.

1648
1:11:13 --> 1:11:17
Something's something's really off about the coffee and she

1649
1:11:17 --> 1:11:21
doesn't know what, but she knows it's off and she goes to open

1650
1:11:21 --> 1:11:26
up the coffee machine and there is a stink bug in the coffee

1651
1:11:26 --> 1:11:29
machine and she is beside herself.

1652
1:11:30 --> 1:11:31
She cannot handle this revelation.

1653
1:11:33 --> 1:11:37
This is like, this is the thing that puts her over the edge.

1654
1:11:38 --> 1:11:42
She gets violently ill from the stink bug in the coffee machine.

1655
1:11:42 --> 1:11:43
She's throwing up everywhere.

1656
1:11:44 --> 1:11:46
She's because she's drank stink bug juice.

1657
1:11:46 --> 1:11:48
So she's just like, dear God.

1658
1:11:49 --> 1:11:54
So she's done not only that, not only that, she is so upset

1659
1:11:55 --> 1:11:58
that I had to buy her a new coffee maker today.

1660
1:11:59 --> 1:12:01
She will not use the stink bug.

1661
1:12:01 --> 1:12:02
What?

1662
1:12:02 --> 1:12:03
Fakes in coffee maker.

1663
1:12:03 --> 1:12:05
I said, there's nothing wrong with this coffee maker.

1664
1:12:05 --> 1:12:07
She's like, I can't even look at it.

1665
1:12:07 --> 1:12:10
I can't, I couldn't even be in the kitchen without getting violently ill.

1666
1:12:10 --> 1:12:11
I'm like, okay.

1667
1:12:12 --> 1:12:15
So if there's one Achilles heel on Old McFeeders,

1668
1:12:15 --> 1:12:16
it's stink bugs and liquids.

1669
1:12:17 --> 1:12:18
It's stink bugs.

1670
1:12:18 --> 1:12:19
There you go.

1671
1:12:19 --> 1:12:21
You got to get a new coffee maker and put a fake stink bug in

1672
1:12:21 --> 1:12:23
there just to start it off right.

1673
1:12:23 --> 1:12:25
Lauren Shreve says, if you've smelled stink bug,

1674
1:12:25 --> 1:12:25
you'll understand.

1675
1:12:25 --> 1:12:26
And it's true.

1676
1:12:26 --> 1:12:29
They are foul, foul things.

1677
1:12:29 --> 1:12:31
We didn't have any, we don't have any in Vegas.

1678
1:12:31 --> 1:12:32
Thank God.

1679
1:12:32 --> 1:12:36
They are nasty, nasty critters.

1680
1:12:36 --> 1:12:38
They're really, really gross.

1681
1:12:38 --> 1:12:42
So anyway, she's got a nice new coffee machine now.

1682
1:12:42 --> 1:12:45
And hopefully that will be all good.

1683
1:12:45 --> 1:12:48
We got the small brown ones.

1684
1:12:49 --> 1:12:52
You just get all these, just a bunch of plastic bugs

1685
1:12:52 --> 1:12:54
to just fill the coffee maker with it.

1686
1:12:54 --> 1:12:56
Oh, no, no, don't.

1687
1:12:56 --> 1:12:57
Oh, she'll be so sad.

1688
1:12:57 --> 1:12:58
Don't send fake plastic bugs.

1689
1:12:59 --> 1:13:00
Honestly, she wouldn't care.

1690
1:13:00 --> 1:13:02
A fake plastic bug wouldn't affect the taste of her coffee.

1691
1:13:03 --> 1:13:05
It's the fact that this bug actually

1692
1:13:06 --> 1:13:09
put all kind of goo in her coffee and she drank it.

1693
1:13:09 --> 1:13:10
It was nasty.

1694
1:13:11 --> 1:13:12
Oh, that pervy bug.

1695
1:13:13 --> 1:13:16
What would disinfect it is if you peed all over the old

1696
1:13:16 --> 1:13:18
coffee maker and that would be, that would help.

1697
1:13:18 --> 1:13:19
I told her we could do that.

1698
1:13:19 --> 1:13:19
Well, no, no, that's,

1699
1:13:19 --> 1:13:21
that's if a jellyfish gets into your coffee maker.

1700
1:13:22 --> 1:13:22
It's just as well.

1701
1:13:22 --> 1:13:23
Oh, that's it.

1702
1:13:23 --> 1:13:24
It's an older model.

1703
1:13:25 --> 1:13:25
It still works great.

1704
1:13:25 --> 1:13:27
I'm going to give it to the Goodwill.

1705
1:13:27 --> 1:13:28
Her name is Ann.

1706
1:13:29 --> 1:13:30
Don't call her an older model.

1707
1:13:31 --> 1:13:35
But the other day when she was really, really sick,

1708
1:13:35 --> 1:13:38
I guess it was Thanksgiving day when she was really, really sick.

1709
1:13:38 --> 1:13:40
She was making coffee for herself

1710
1:13:40 --> 1:13:43
and she forgot to put a cup in the machine.

1711
1:13:43 --> 1:13:45
And I came in and I'm like,

1712
1:13:45 --> 1:13:46
Ann, what the fuck?

1713
1:13:46 --> 1:13:49
She was just spilling coffee all over the machine.

1714
1:13:49 --> 1:13:51
And the thing is your coffee maker does that.

1715
1:13:51 --> 1:13:53
Then you do need to get a new coffee maker.

1716
1:13:53 --> 1:13:55
Your coffee maker is out of date.

1717
1:13:55 --> 1:13:55
Yeah.

1718
1:13:55 --> 1:13:57
So she was like, I don't even know what I'm doing.

1719
1:13:57 --> 1:14:00
But it got coffee all in the base of the machine.

1720
1:14:00 --> 1:14:02
So it can go now.

1721
1:14:02 --> 1:14:04
It's, it's, it served its time.

1722
1:14:04 --> 1:14:05
It's time.

1723
1:14:05 --> 1:14:07
Poor thing was, poor thing was just out of it.

1724
1:14:07 --> 1:14:09
Well, I for one, I'm certainly glad

1725
1:14:09 --> 1:14:11
that Ann finally got her comeuppance

1726
1:14:11 --> 1:14:14
for waking you up earlier than you wanted to wake up.

1727
1:14:14 --> 1:14:14
Yeah.

1728
1:14:14 --> 1:14:16
She got her come up and serves her right

1729
1:14:16 --> 1:14:19
in the, in the form of a brand new coffee maker.

1730
1:14:21 --> 1:14:22
No, it's all good.

1731
1:14:22 --> 1:14:23
She's dead right.

1732
1:14:23 --> 1:14:24
And I would be the most upset

1733
1:14:24 --> 1:14:27
if we had any kind of water damage happen,

1734
1:14:27 --> 1:14:29
because that's coming right down here

1735
1:14:29 --> 1:14:31
to the old back cave.

1736
1:14:31 --> 1:14:33
You know, it's not going anywhere but down.

1737
1:14:34 --> 1:14:36
And these, these, I've got plenty of stuff

1738
1:14:36 --> 1:14:38
that won't be too terribly affected

1739
1:14:38 --> 1:14:39
because most of it's all plastic,

1740
1:14:40 --> 1:14:42
but there's plenty of paper down here

1741
1:14:42 --> 1:14:42
to get fucked.

1742
1:14:43 --> 1:14:44
I gotta, I gotta believe Paul,

1743
1:14:44 --> 1:14:45
even if you weren't there,

1744
1:14:45 --> 1:14:47
I think if the basement started flooding,

1745
1:14:47 --> 1:14:49
I think the squirrel would get

1746
1:14:49 --> 1:14:50
most of the stuff out of the basement.

1747
1:14:50 --> 1:14:51
I think the squirrel would save

1748
1:14:51 --> 1:14:53
most of the possessions down there.

1749
1:14:53 --> 1:14:54
Think they're, they're that

1750
1:14:54 --> 1:14:55
sensible to get everything out?

1751
1:14:56 --> 1:14:56
Maybe.

1752
1:14:56 --> 1:14:56
I do.

1753
1:14:56 --> 1:14:57
I think, I think this,

1754
1:14:57 --> 1:14:58
I think the squirrels have taken full ownership

1755
1:14:58 --> 1:15:00
of the basement and everything in it.

1756
1:15:00 --> 1:15:01
They want to take care of it.

1757
1:15:02 --> 1:15:02
All right.

1758
1:15:03 --> 1:15:04
They don't have an insurance policy.

1759
1:15:04 --> 1:15:04
One night at Paul's house

1760
1:15:04 --> 1:15:06
and the world's my oyster.

1761
1:15:07 --> 1:15:10
I creep and crawl in whenever I want to.

1762
1:15:11 --> 1:15:12
Sarah Boyle?

1763
1:15:14 --> 1:15:15
No, that's the scoop.

1764
1:15:15 --> 1:15:16
Susan Boyle, that's the name.

1765
1:15:16 --> 1:15:16
Shit.

1766
1:15:16 --> 1:15:18
Susan Boyle.

1767
1:15:20 --> 1:15:22
One night at Susan Boyle.

1768
1:15:22 --> 1:15:23
I want to thank Mike Jones

1769
1:15:23 --> 1:15:24
for coming on the program.

1770
1:15:25 --> 1:15:25
Absolutely.

1771
1:15:25 --> 1:15:26
I'm going to tell them to subscribe

1772
1:15:26 --> 1:15:27
to his podcast.

1773
1:15:27 --> 1:15:28
Go get his live out.

1774
1:15:28 --> 1:15:29
And it's going to vex if you're around

1775
1:15:29 --> 1:15:30
Vegas Monday night.

1776
1:15:31 --> 1:15:32
I also want to thank all the scoops

1777
1:15:32 --> 1:15:34
who joined us here on, on Twitch.

1778
1:15:35 --> 1:15:35
Yes.

1779
1:15:35 --> 1:15:36
I want to thank all the scoops

1780
1:15:36 --> 1:15:37
who joined us here on Zoom.

1781
1:15:38 --> 1:15:38
That's right.

1782
1:15:38 --> 1:15:40
And it's normal we thank people

1783
1:15:40 --> 1:15:40
in the show.

1784
1:15:40 --> 1:15:41
It's a new month.

1785
1:15:41 --> 1:15:41
We haven't got to thank you

1786
1:15:41 --> 1:15:43
this coordinated yet,

1787
1:15:43 --> 1:15:44
but I want to thank, of course,

1788
1:15:44 --> 1:15:45
everyone who supports us

1789
1:15:45 --> 1:15:46
over on our Patreon.

1790
1:15:46 --> 1:15:48
All the people who find it

1791
1:15:48 --> 1:15:49
in their hearts and in their wallets

1792
1:15:49 --> 1:15:51
to go over to preachingfun.com.

1793
1:16:09 --> 1:16:10
I'm really looking forward to the day

1794
1:16:10 --> 1:16:11
that I don't have to play

1795
1:16:11 --> 1:16:12
that whole theme manually.

1796
1:16:13 --> 1:16:15
I'm actually, I've gotten it all

1797
1:16:15 --> 1:16:16
inked out on a piece of paper

1798
1:16:16 --> 1:16:17
and I'm going to have somebody cut

1799
1:16:17 --> 1:16:18
out all the little holes

1800
1:16:18 --> 1:16:19
in it for a player piano.

1801
1:16:20 --> 1:16:20
But in the meantime,

1802
1:16:21 --> 1:16:22
check out fartsinabag.biz.

1803
1:16:31 --> 1:16:33
That's fartsinabag.biz

1804
1:16:33 --> 1:16:34
that along with preachingfun.com

1805
1:16:34 --> 1:16:36
it takes you over to our Patreon page

1806
1:16:36 --> 1:16:37
where for as little as

1807
1:16:37 --> 1:16:38
three dollars a month

1808
1:16:38 --> 1:16:40
you can upkeep this show on the air.

1809
1:16:40 --> 1:16:42
We are dependent on our Patreon subscribers.

1810
1:16:43 --> 1:16:44
So if you are not a Patreon subscriber

1811
1:16:45 --> 1:16:46
preachingfun.com

1812
1:16:47 --> 1:16:48
fartsinabag.biz

1813
1:16:48 --> 1:16:48
head over there.

1814
1:16:49 --> 1:16:50
If you think this show is worth

1815
1:16:50 --> 1:16:51
more than zero dollars

1816
1:16:51 --> 1:16:52
you can upkeep this show on the air

1817
1:16:52 --> 1:16:54
and we sure do thank you for it.

1818
1:16:54 --> 1:16:55
If you can't do it,

1819
1:16:55 --> 1:16:56
if you can't go over and do

1820
1:16:56 --> 1:16:58
the monetary value thing,

1821
1:16:58 --> 1:16:59
that is okay.

1822
1:16:59 --> 1:17:00
Not everybody is able to do that

1823
1:17:00 --> 1:17:01
these days.

1824
1:17:01 --> 1:17:02
Tell somebody about us.

1825
1:17:02 --> 1:17:04
Tell one person, one person only.

1826
1:17:04 --> 1:17:05
Don't do the two friends

1827
1:17:05 --> 1:17:06
and then they tell two friends

1828
1:17:06 --> 1:17:07
things.

1829
1:17:07 --> 1:17:08
That is a pyramid scheme.

1830
1:17:09 --> 1:17:10
It is unethical.

1831
1:17:10 --> 1:17:12
We don't get into that.

1832
1:17:12 --> 1:17:13
We do an obelisk scheme.

1833
1:17:13 --> 1:17:15
You tell one person, one person only.

1834
1:17:15 --> 1:17:17
It's vertical growth

1835
1:17:17 --> 1:17:18
but you're going to find that one person

1836
1:17:18 --> 1:17:20
that really kind of digs

1837
1:17:20 --> 1:17:21
this weird thing that we're doing over here.

1838
1:17:21 --> 1:17:23
So go let them know about us.

1839
1:17:23 --> 1:17:24
Let them know about the obelisk scheme.

1840
1:17:25 --> 1:17:26
One person and one person only

1841
1:17:26 --> 1:17:29
but that person has to dig this thing

1842
1:17:29 --> 1:17:31
and probably preferably

1843
1:17:32 --> 1:17:33
get on there

1844
1:17:33 --> 1:17:33
and support the Patreon

1845
1:17:33 --> 1:17:35
within the first, I don't know

1846
1:17:35 --> 1:17:37
10 minutes or so if you're telling them about us.

1847
1:17:37 --> 1:17:38
That'd be really convenient for us.

1848
1:17:39 --> 1:17:42
Don't forget about our billionaire experiment.

1849
1:17:43 --> 1:17:45
Don't forget, get each of us a billion dollars

1850
1:17:45 --> 1:17:48
and we will see if we can be better billionaires

1851
1:17:48 --> 1:17:49
than the current ones.

1852
1:17:51 --> 1:17:53
Oh, shout out to Radio Active Scoop

1853
1:17:53 --> 1:17:54
for doubling their Patreon.

1854
1:17:55 --> 1:17:55
Thank you.

1855
1:17:55 --> 1:17:56
Oh, thank you Radio Active Scoop.

1856
1:17:56 --> 1:17:59
Yeah, we had a little bump in our Patreon this month.

1857
1:17:59 --> 1:18:00
Thank you guys so much.

1858
1:18:00 --> 1:18:00
Love it.

1859
1:18:01 --> 1:18:02
Line go up.

1860
1:18:03 --> 1:18:03
That's what we want.

1861
1:18:04 --> 1:18:04
That's right.

1862
1:18:06 --> 1:18:07
Thanks for listening, everybody.

1863
1:18:07 --> 1:18:08
Stay safe out there.

1864
1:18:08 --> 1:18:10
We love you and we'll see you soon.

1865
1:18:10 --> 1:18:11
We'll see you soon.

1866
1:18:33 --> 1:18:34
Sight go check that out.

1867
1:18:35 --> 1:18:36
Follow them on social media.

1868
1:18:36 --> 1:18:37
You get all the hints and tips.

1869
1:18:40 --> 1:18:40
We're preaching fun.
