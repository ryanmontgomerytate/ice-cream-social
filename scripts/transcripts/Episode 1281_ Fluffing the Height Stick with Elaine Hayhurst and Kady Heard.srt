1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,580
 - Oh, hello there.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,620
 I didn't see you there, but I am so glad you are here.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,860
 It's time to thank you, the Ice Cream Truck Drivers.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,700
 Who are the Ice Cream Truck Drivers?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,900
 Well, these are the folks that deliver

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,680
 that fucking ice cream straight to your fucking ear holes.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,880
 Right now, I'd like to thank David Walker,

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,020
 Dead Lazlo, Dirty Old Scoop,

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,440
 Galactic President Scooper Star McScoops-A-Lot,

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,600
 Ice Blue Scoop, Jacob Dinklage, Jeff Harris,

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,120
 Jobbeth Bowers, and John Mattingly.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,320
 If you wanna be an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,820
 and I sure hope you do,

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,860
 PreachingFun.com is where you can go, PreachingFun.com.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,560
 Head over there, sign up to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver,

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,560
 and who knows, the life you save may be your own.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,400
 And now, a show.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,540
 - Hey, Johnny.

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,220
 Do you wanna go to an ice cream social?

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,640
 - Yeah, I'd love to.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,820
 - Great, let's go.

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,160
 - Oh man, it's so exciting.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,160
 We have the stars of Showgirls, the unauthorized musical here.

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,560
 - Yes.

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,540
 - With us, talking about all kinds of showgirls.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,720
 It's pretty exciting.

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,600
 I made it at the end right here.

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,760
 - It's time for Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social,

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,920
 sitting over there in Las Vegas.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 That's Matt Mattingly, sitting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,200
 That's Paul Mattingly, and in Las Vegas, it's me,

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
 Jacob, the audio guy, PreachingFun.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,560
 I forgot Pittsburgh for a half second there.

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
 - It's easy to do.

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,020
 - Somewhere in Pennsylvania.

37
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,860
 - It's easy to do.

38
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,700
 - Philadelphia?

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,520
 No, that's not right.

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,360
 - No, we're still covered in snow.

41
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,160
 It's so cold here, it's disgusting.

42
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,360
 It's in the single digits,

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,600
 and it's gonna be that way for a long time.

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,080
 - It's disgusting.

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,960
 - We're gonna get hit with a lot of snow later this week.

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,580
 It's gonna be awful, but yeah.

47
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,440
 - I walked outside with no shoes on today,

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,160
 and just took the dogs outside, went and fed the fish,

49
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,040
 and thought, boy, this sure is a nice January day.

50
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,220
 - Man, it's getting crazy everywhere.

51
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,480
 I'm fighting with my kid to take a sweatshirt

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
 with him every day.

53
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,140
 He's like, "I don't need one."

54
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,880
 I was like, "You might."

55
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,760
 It might suddenly become January for real.

56
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
 You don't know.

57
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,360
 - If you're out after it gets dark, you'll need one.

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,760
 I leave the house every day.

59
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,240
 If I have a backpack with me or something,

60
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
 I have a sweatshirt inside the backpack,

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
 because I know once it gets dark, I'll need it.

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,080
 - Jacob and Paul, what was your opinion

63
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,840
 of "Showgirls the Movie" when it came out, and what is it now?

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,540
 - I love it unapologetically.

65
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,360
 We have a friend, SJ and I have a friend

66
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,840
 who was in the "Showgirls" movie.

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,520
 She was one of the dancers in the "Showgirls" movie.

68
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,720
 So we've had multiple movie watching parties with her

69
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,480
 over the years with different friends,

70
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,880
 and she would talk about some of her experience

71
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,280
 putting "Showgirls the Movie" together

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,600
 and all that kind of stuff.

73
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,400
 And boy, I was the right age for "Saved by the Bell."

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,680
 So Elizabeth Berkeley coming into doing an NC 17 movie

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,040
 when I was in junior high,

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,800
 maybe a freshman in high school, was a big fucking deal.

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
 (laughing)

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,480
 Let me explain that to you very clearly.

79
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
 It was big.

80
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,320
 - It really was like took Tiffany Amber Thiessen's

81
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,240
 Maxim photo shoot and put it on blast.

82
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
 - Yeah, it did.

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,520
 - If you think that's enough, it is not.

84
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,280
 - Hold my beer, Maxim photo shoot.

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,080
 - It took me a little while to get into that flick.

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,700
 I didn't watch it during its original theatrical run.

87
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,660
 I believe I owned it on DVD at some point.

88
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,560
 - Okay. - Maybe, I'm not sure.

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,000
 But I have seen it a couple of times.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,880
 It's hilarious to me.

91
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,100
 And I am Facebook friends with Patrick Bristow,

92
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,100
 who is the caddy choreographer from the show.

93
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,480
 - Great.

94
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,480
 - He is actually good friends with my pal, Sarah McChesney,

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,400
 who has worked with Henson in the past.

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,160
 She's a puppeteer.

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,440
 And Patrick has gone on.

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
 He is the host of "Puppet Up"

99
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,360
 for most of the time that that show has done,

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,920
 which is the improvised Muppets thing.

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,560
 - Yeah, the Henson puppet show.

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,960
 - I think I know where this is going, Paul.

103
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,320
 And no, we're not making an all puppet version

104
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
 of "Showgirls."

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,980
 We're not doing it.

106
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,820
 We're not gonna do it.

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,040
 - Not yet, not yet.

108
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,800
 And also, Matt, it's not an all puppet version.

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,040
 It's an all puppet version, except for one human character.

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
 That's how it goes.

111
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,560
 That's how these movies are produced.

112
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,720
 - That's right, that's right.

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,280
 Who would the one human character in "Showgirls" be, Paul?

114
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,700
 - Oh, it had to be Kyle McLaughlin,

115
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,380
 coming back to reprise his role, at this age.

116
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,480
 (laughing)

117
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
 He's the only one with the--

118
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
 - I'm the same guy.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,840
 - He's the only one with the gravitas to pull it off.

120
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,880
 And with a straight face.

121
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,780
 He could do it with a straight face.

122
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
 - You're right.

123
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,920
 - I know, I know, I haven't not thought about this.

124
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,560
 (laughing)

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,800
 So, but yeah, I'm desperate that maybe one day

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
 I'll get involved with "Puppet Up" a little more too,

127
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,040
 'cause I've got a lot of satellite pals within that orbit.

128
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,080
 - Paul, the question wasn't about you and puppets at all,

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
 as a matter of fact.

130
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,120
 It was, what did you think about the movie?

131
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,000
 - But what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is,

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,880
 "Showgirls" is-- - You're clarifying

133
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,160
 the question you've always asked yourself.

134
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,720
 - Has always been rife for parody and puppetry.

135
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
 (laughing)

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,480
 - Well, I believe you do-- - Also, living--

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,760
 - I believe you do get both in this unauthorized parody.

138
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,000
 I'm going to see it tomorrow night, it's a press opening,

139
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,160
 so I'm going to see it tomorrow night.

140
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,700
 - Oh, nice. - I'm very excited.

141
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,240
 - I have tickets to see it, I think on March 1st.

142
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,500
 - Okay, very cool.

143
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,320
 - Yeah, or a group of us are going to go on March 1st

144
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 and go see it.

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,720
 - Elaine, when this first came on your radar,

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,400
 what made you decide to hop in and give it a go,

147
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,760
 to be in the "Showgirls" parody musical?

148
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,920
 - Well, I've always been a huge fan,

149
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,440
 and particularly a huge fan of Nomi Malone,

150
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,080
 which is the character I'm playing.

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,720
 I mean, she's just a savage.

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,720
 When else, as a woman, do you get to, you know,

153
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,460
 basically practically stab people,

154
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,480
 push 'em down the stairs, play all of the emotions,

155
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,040
 but you're just a girl with a dream,

156
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
 and you just have to do, you know,

157
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,220
 she's just dealing with the obstacles in front of her,

158
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,580
 taking 'em on one by one, and yeah,

159
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,520
 so I've always loved her, and it's a joy to play her.

160
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,200
 - A Rosie the Riveter type, if you will.

161
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,360
 (laughing)

162
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,080
 - A pioneer, yeah. - Sure.

163
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,920
 - The feminist icon writer and director, Joe Esterhouse,

164
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,040
 (laughing)

165
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,800
 named Nomi Malone, 'cause it would be,

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,640
 basically also mean, "Know me, I am alone,"

167
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,480
 and he wanted that to be very significant

168
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,280
 about that character.

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,640
 - I wanna see a list of the top 10 things

170
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,280
 that he wanted to be significant in "Showgirls."

171
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,320
 - Oh, but you're-- - Oh my God, me too.

172
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,140
 - It's quite, yeah, like the license plate,

173
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,760
 like he is a lot, he made all the choices

174
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,840
 thinking he was making a very significant movie.

175
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,460
 - Good, good, that's what I want.

176
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,640
 - Well, and he was.

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,520
 - Yeah, and he was right.

178
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,560
 - And touchdown, success.

179
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,360
 - Yeah, remind people who Naomi is.

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,800
 - It's Nomi, actually. - Nomi, excuse me.

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,240
 - So she is-- - Start there, start there.

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,620
 - I will see myself out.

183
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,680
 - She's the main, you know, main character,

184
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,600
 one of the main characters in "Showgirls,"

185
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,600
 and we catch up with her kind of hitchhiking to Las Vegas.

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,320
 She decides she's gonna go to Vegas and dance.

187
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,920
 We don't know that much about her past at the beginning,

188
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
 you know, that kind of is revealed later on,

189
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,600
 but she's a dancer, she's ambitious,

190
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,760
 and she sees one of the big production shows

191
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,840
 in Las Vegas starring Crystal Connors,

192
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,000
 my co-star here, Katie,

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,560
 and she's kind of like, "I could do that."

194
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,200
 From there ensues like the path of ascension, you know,

195
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,360
 taking out obstacles as they come,

196
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,320
 whether that be her fellow "Showgirls,"

197
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,080
 or like Kyle McLaughlin,

198
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,120
 like who's the entertainment director wooing him,

199
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,920
 just kind of, you know,

200
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,880
 all the steps that I'm sure real "Showgirls" go through

201
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,840
 to make it to the top.

202
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
 - Well, that's what I was gonna ask you.

203
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,240
 I wanted to hear about the parallels

204
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,680
 between Nomi and your own showbiz career, of course.

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,880
 - Right.

206
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,220
 - What are the positives and negatives?

207
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,280
 - Well, you know, if a man's trying to sexual harass you,

208
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,520
 sexually harass you, you gotta pull a knife on him,

209
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,520
 obviously, especially, you know, post 2016,

210
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,360
 they really, you know, that is encouraged.

211
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,560
 - That's option one, go right to that.

212
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,560
 - You know, if, yeah, if someone's in your way,

213
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
 you've gotta push them down the stairs,

214
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
 either literally or figuratively,

215
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,240
 but I do like the literal approach, personally.

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,000
 - It is, it works, it works.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,200
 - Yeah, yeah, it does.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,160
 And you just have to, you know,

219
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,080
 try and make sure you don't get caught.

220
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,480
 Because that's the key to it all, you know.

221
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,200
 - We actually did have a guest on the show.

222
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,400
 It was a peep show.

223
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,440
 And they did have shenanigans.

224
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,320
 Do you remember someone put pins in her boots?

225
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,200
 Someone was trying to sabotage her

226
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
 and put thumb tacks in her boots,

227
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,720
 trying to take her out of the show.

228
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
 - Oh, I do vaguely remember this.

229
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,240
 That sounds familiar.

230
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,840
 There was so much shit that went on with that show.

231
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,120
 - Tara, yeah, someone tried to put pins

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
 in Tara Palsha's boots.

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
 - That makes sense.

234
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
 To be fair, I did apologize.

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,840
 (laughing)

236
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,400
 - Well, you know, this was the path,

237
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,560
 the career path chosen by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

238
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,600
 She came up as a Vegas showgirl.

239
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,240
 That was how she cut her teeth.

240
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,200
 And then, speaking of cutting their teeth,

241
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,760
 Matt, you might wanna close your ears for this.

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,200
 I've mentioned this before, but it's been a minute.

243
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 So you remember the Jenna Jameson, the porn star.

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
 - Who?

245
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,880
 - That name's familiar.

246
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
 - Sorry, I was just trying to--

247
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 - She also went through a dancer/showgirl moment

248
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,400
 at a very early age, and at a certain point,

249
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,720
 she went so far.

250
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,960
 In her ambition, she had braces on at the time,

251
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,560
 and it would belie her young age.

252
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,400
 She had her brother take pliers to her head

253
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,680
 and pull the braces off.

254
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,760
 - Oh!

255
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
 - Yes.

256
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
 - Oh my God.

257
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,640
 - In order to pass as older.

258
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,120
 (laughing)

259
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
 Yeah, so she, yeah.

260
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,040
 If you've ever read her biography,

261
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,800
 that's a hell of a showgirl biography, too.

262
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
 That's pretty wild.

263
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
 - I'm gonna do that.

264
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
 My son has braces right now.

265
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,240
 I'll make sure to remove them myself with pliers.

266
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,080
 - All right, yeah.

267
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,320
 - You don't own pliers.

268
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
 - Daddy needs smokes.

269
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,120
 (laughing)

270
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,840
 Jacob, take my son's braces off his face.

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,800
 (laughing)

272
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,760
 - Jacob, come over and bring some pliers.

273
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,080
 - There's gotta be some silver in these things.

274
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,920
 Melt 'em down.

275
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,080
 - Now, Katie, every time I watch this movie,

276
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
 sorry, I'm just gonna jump right into the next--

277
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,680
 - We both are doing the same thing.

278
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,960
 We both are transitioning to Katie.

279
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,840
 Go ahead, Jacob, the floor is yours.

280
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,320
 - Katie, every time I watch Showgirls,

281
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,320
 I am struck by the '90s Vegas

282
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,160
 and all of the kind of entertainment landscape

283
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,880
 that was '90s Vegas.

284
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,840
 I moved here in 2007.

285
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,960
 And you and I have been old, we're old friends.

286
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,200
 We've known each other for a couple of years,

287
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
 for a year or two.

288
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,000
 And yeah, this is my training from SJ.

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,400
 I just say I've known people for a year or two.

290
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,240
 (laughing)

291
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,200
 - That's smart.

292
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,280
 - Yeah.

293
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,400
 Yeah, so we've known each other for a year or two.

294
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,160
 How much does that kind of old Vegas

295
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,000
 and old showbiz casting in Vegas

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
 and kind of that old showbiz energy in Vegas,

297
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
 how does that make you feel?

298
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,200
 Compare that a little bit to your old days in Vegas,

299
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,120
 if you would.

300
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,760
 - Oh, well, I mean, I remember,

301
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
 so when I moved here in 2008,

302
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,560
 like the Riviera, which is very prominent

303
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,960
 in the backdrop of that movie was still up.

304
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,600
 Like some of those old neons that you see in the movie,

305
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,720
 we're still here.

306
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,400
 And so, yeah, it just, when I watch it now,

307
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,560
 parts of it feel still very like today Vegas,

308
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,560
 but most of it feels really, really old and not dated,

309
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,400
 but like, oh, that was so beautiful.

310
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,760
 Why did we get rid of all that?

311
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,560
 Um, yeah.

312
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,800
 - Yeah, Vegas, Vegas has gone so mainstream now

313
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
 that you see old portraits of it

314
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,080
 when it was still like this cool kind of like escape place

315
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 and you're like, oh man, bad ass.

316
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,720
 - Right. - Yeah, yeah.

317
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,600
 - Kids from Iowa hitchhiking on the side of the road.

318
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,200
 - 'Cause-- - Different places.

319
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,320
 - Did you always love this movie, Katie?

320
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,440
 Do you always have a love affair with this movie?

321
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,920
 - No, I didn't really see, it's weird the way I saw it.

322
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,280
 - Upside down. - When I grew up,

323
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,240
 both of my parents, yeah, right?

324
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
 My parents were ministers,

325
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,880
 so I definitely didn't see "Showgirls"

326
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,360
 until I was moving out here.

327
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,720
 Like literally the night before I moved out here

328
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,160
 to be in Jubilee, I watched two movies.

329
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
 I'm not even making this up.

330
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,760
 I watched "Showgirls" and I watched "Alive"

331
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,720
 'cause it was on TV and I was about to get on a plane.

332
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,520
 And I don't know what's wrong with me.

333
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,320
 - If you had given me a million guesses

334
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,360
 for the second movie, I would have not gotten to "Alive."

335
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,120
 - Were you simply trying to scare yourself

336
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,600
 out of making this life move?

337
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,280
 Were you trying to like, don't do it?

338
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,040
 - I, yeah, I don't know.

339
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,200
 But you know, the weird thing is that "Showgirls"

340
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,080
 didn't make me afraid to come out here

341
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,360
 and be in a big "Showgirls" show.

342
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,640
 It actually like made me even more excited.

343
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,240
 - Oh really? - 'Cause it was so,

344
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,440
 that movie's so pretty.

345
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,400
 The costumes and the makeup, oh my God.

346
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,920
 - Will you give people a little inside,

347
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,320
 behind the curtain look?

348
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
 The audition process, we see a little bit

349
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
 of like the big lineup audition

350
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,640
 for the big Vegas "Showgirls" show in "Showgirls."

351
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,400
 Will you talk a little bit about those big

352
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,120
 kind of lineup auditions where, you know,

353
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,040
 100 people, 200 people, 300 people would show up

354
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,240
 and they'd just have to basically go through 'em

355
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
 factory style?

356
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,240
 - Yeah, well, the first thing that Jubilee would do,

357
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,520
 which I totally appreciated was they held like a stick up.

358
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,320
 And before you even stepped on the stage,

359
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,600
 if your head did not pass that stick,

360
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
 it was, "Thank you so much, goodbye."

361
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,280
 'Cause you're not tall enough to be in the show then.

362
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,520
 - SJ is familiar with the stick.

363
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,680
 - Oh no, oh, I'm sorry.

364
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,560
 - You're like, "I know, but I still wanna get my tits

365
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,200
 "out today and now I can't even do that."

366
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,120
 - Oh, she would show up with like tall hair and everything

367
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,560
 and they'd just, they'd smoosh it right down with the stick.

368
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
 I feel like it would be so hurt.

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,960
 - That's a bummer.

370
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,600
 - People know that she was at Jubilee.

371
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,560
 - That stick was the director, that's the weird part.

372
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
 - That stick was named Fluff.

373
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,040
 - Right.

374
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,560
 - That was Fluff the stick.

375
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,480
 - Yeah, and then the next thing they would do is

376
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,600
 you had to do PK turns across the stage

377
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,240
 because you can tell in one PK turn

378
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,680
 if that person has had any dance training at all.

379
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
 - Oh, fascinating.

380
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,240
 - And so then they, yeah.

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,640
 So then they would make a cut from there

382
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,080
 and then you'd start learning combos and stuff.

383
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,520
 And the audition-- - So before the combos,

384
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,800
 what percentage of people are cut before the combos?

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,560
 - Oh, 50.

386
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,840
 - Wow.

387
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

388
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,680
 'Cause a lot of girls would show up just like,

389
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,760
 well, I'm pretty, well, I dance at this strip club.

390
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,560
 I could be in this show, kind of Nomi style actually.

391
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,360
 - Yeah. - You know?

392
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
 - That's what I tell myself--

393
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
 - Well, where do you think they got the idea?

394
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,880
 - I leave the house, I tell myself I'm pretty

395
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,040
 and then I go about my day with a lot of confidence.

396
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,360
 - I'm pretty enough to do this.

397
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,640
 - And in this show, you play the villain,

398
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,800
 Gina Gershon's part.

399
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,160
 Was that something you were looking forward to playing?

400
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,800
 Is that something you wanted to play?

401
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,400
 - I had played Nomi the last time we did this show,

402
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,440
 which was like almost a decade ago.

403
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,280
 - Okay.

404
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,000
 - And when Troy said he was doing it again,

405
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,360
 I said, "Cool, I'll be one of the dancers.

406
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,240
 "I don't wanna be Nomi."

407
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,640
 'Cause that part's really hard.

408
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,080
 You don't leave the stage, it's exhausting.

409
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,840
 (laughing)

410
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,680
 And then--

411
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,960
 - And Leigh just pointed to her head like mental note.

412
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,800
 - Sorry. - Yeah, yeah.

413
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,920
 - Yeah, sorry.

414
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,080
 - This is up there with Pym saying,

415
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,360
 "Don't write yourself running in scenes."

416
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,640
 (laughing)

417
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
 - Very smart, yep.

418
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,760
 And so then when it was getting closer to auditions,

419
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,480
 I kind of said to him, "You know, I feel like

420
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,760
 "if no one shows up for Crystal that you're interested in,

421
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,800
 "I feel like I could play Crystal.

422
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,880
 "I've been a showgirl now for 17 years

423
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,880
 "and I'm tired and I'm jaded and I get this woman."

424
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,160
 - Between the last iteration and this one,

425
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,680
 you felt like you've earned the role.

426
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,640
 - 100%, yep.

427
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,360
 (laughing)

428
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,400
 - I want the role that I identify the most with

429
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,160
 and that is this person over here.

430
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
 - Yep. - Go fuck yourself.

431
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,600
 And now you and Elaine have been friends for a long time.

432
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,040
 You guys have been accused of being twins.

433
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,000
 - Yeah.

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
 - You've done a lot of gigs together.

435
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,480
 - Yep.

436
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
 - Was not knowing if you guys didn't realize

437
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,760
 at the audition that you'd be working with each other

438
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,280
 in the two lead roles, right?

439
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,960
 - Well, so Elaine had kind of talked to me

440
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,440
 about maybe auditioning for showgirls

441
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,280
 before the audition popped up

442
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,200
 and then she just wasn't at auditions.

443
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,760
 (laughing)

444
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,480
 - Fucking boss move, Elaine.

445
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,320
 Boss fucking move.

446
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,400
 - Yeah. - Best way to get a part.

447
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,280
 (laughing)

448
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,840
 - Leave 'em wanting more.

449
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,480
 - And then like when they were looking for a Nomi,

450
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,400
 I was like, "Look, there is one girl I know of in this city

451
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,480
 that is beautiful, that is great to work with

452
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,000
 and that is absolutely not afraid to be crazy ugly."

453
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
 (laughing)

454
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,320
 - That's the requirement.

455
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,440
 - Yeah, absolutely.

456
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,680
 (laughing)

457
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,000
 - That girl was busy.

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,560
 (laughing)

459
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,200
 - She was too busy making some kind

460
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,000
 of giant Hormel chili dip on her.

461
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,840
 (laughing)

462
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,680
 - Yeah.

463
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,200
 - Elaine, you have this entire other life as this,

464
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,600
 do you say bizarre cooking influencer?

465
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,000
 How do you phrase your--

466
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,560
 - So I say like content creator or like internet chef,

467
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,560
 but yeah, I kind of have an alter ego

468
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,560
 that's especially on my Instagram,

469
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,560
 like a Midwestern housewife who is well-meaning

470
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,560
 and just trying to make semi-homemade like Sandra Lee

471
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,400
 in the largest quantities possible most of the time.

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
 (laughing)

473
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,000
 - You have this gigantic grill

474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,240
 that you always just pile tons of stuff on

475
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,080
 to create these amazingly ornate, delicious looking,

476
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
 but crazy huge meals.

477
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,000
 - Well, thank you for the delicious looking.

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,320
 That's such a, quite a compliment.

479
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,960
 Yeah, this summer, like I really,

480
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,440
 I just had this idea.

481
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,280
 I really wanted to do Blackstone stuff.

482
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,240
 So we got one of those big Blackstones,

483
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,920
 I think ours is like three feet.

484
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
 - Yeah.

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 - Anything that you could cook on a Blackstone

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,960
 or could not cook on a Blackstone, I tried it, so.

487
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,320
 - What's your favorite, what's your least favorite?

488
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,080
 - Well, one of my favorites was,

489
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,760
 I saw this recipe for twice baked apple and cherry pie.

490
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,080
 And so I went to Costco

491
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,040
 and bought three large versions of those.

492
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,640
 And I flipped them face down on the Blackstone

493
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,040
 one after another.

494
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,280
 (laughing)

495
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,920
 Jizzled, drizzled them with some sweetened condensed milk,

496
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,880
 added some other ingredients.

497
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,440
 Just, you know, if you need like a big pie to feed a group

498
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,680
 of like 60 to 100, like I definitely recommend

499
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,240
 doing it this way.

500
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,080
 - I still remember, like I became friends with Elaine

501
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
 through just like mutual friends in town.

502
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,040
 And so I became friends on a regular Instagram account.

503
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,880
 And then someone was like, well,

504
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,760
 obviously she's busy being an influencer.

505
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,680
 And I was like, wait, what?

506
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,800
 And I was just only friends with your personal.

507
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
 - I hate when that happens.

508
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,160
 - Your personal account.

509
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,480
 And I was like, whatever.

510
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,320
 And then I went over to your big page

511
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,040
 and you're making like a punch for like,

512
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,160
 if you're having a backyard, you know, get together,

513
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000
 make a punch.

514
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,920
 And then I was like, and I was, I was, I was like duped.

515
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 You're like, show like a little thing of fruit punch

516
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,440
 and all of a sudden there's like a kiddie pool

517
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,560
 and the kiddie pool is being filled, just filled with,

518
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,280
 with booze and liquids and all kinds of chopped fruit

519
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
 and all kinds of stuff.

520
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,720
 And I was like, what's happening?

521
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,000
 And then I looked at your page, I was like, it's all this.

522
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,640
 It's all this crazy stuff.

523
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,680
 - It's all that, yeah, yeah.

524
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,160
 Yeah, you know, like lots of themed party foods.

525
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,000
 - I love it.

526
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,840
 - Sometimes it's in a fish tank.

527
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,280
 Sometimes it's in a kiddie pool.

528
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,520
 You gotta make the people happy.

529
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,360
 Give them what they want.

530
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,520
 - You do, you do.

531
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,440
 You did one, like a pumpkin pie one near the holidays

532
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,240
 with on that big grill, like a pumpkin thing.

533
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
 And I was like, I like your videos

534
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,680
 'cause you go like, yes.

535
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,000
 And then all of a sudden something happens, you go, no.

536
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,160
 And then something else happens, you go, yes.

537
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,360
 And then you're like, no.

538
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,000
 And then by the end you're like, I would eat all of that.

539
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,840
 I would eat all of that.

540
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,000
 She's right, she won.

541
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,840
 - Yeah.

542
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,680
 - Yeah.

543
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,920
 (laughing)

544
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
 - I've got to check this out.

545
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,480
 I have a Blackstone.

546
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,440
 So I've got to check this out

547
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,280
 and see what I need to be doing on my Blackstone.

548
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,600
 - Yeah, so you're busy with your crazy

549
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
 influencing content creating.

550
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
 You say to your friend, you want to be in Showgirls.

551
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
 You don't go to the audition.

552
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,800
 What happens when you get the call from Katie?

553
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
 Was it, oops, I forgot.

554
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,560
 Or was it like, were you on the fence

555
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,960
 about committing the time?

556
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,720
 Like what happened there?

557
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
 - No, you know what?

558
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,480
 I was on the fence about getting my boobs out.

559
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,320
 - Ah.

560
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,400
 - Ah, sure.

561
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,680
 - Yeah.

562
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
 I mean, I wasn't on the, I guess like I'm,

563
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,600
 I haven't been in a show like Jubilee.

564
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,160
 I haven't ever been.

565
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,320
 I don't even duper less or anything like that.

566
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 So, you know, it was a not sure slash deal breaker for me

567
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,280
 with that.

568
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,160
 And so I had to talk to her about it.

569
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,480
 But then, yeah, when they didn't have a know me,

570
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,600
 well, I was like, okay, this is my dream role.

571
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,080
 And I figured maybe there was a little more wiggle room

572
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,120
 for negotiation with that, you know.

573
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,440
 - Holly Barry negotiated like $500,000 a tit

574
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,720
 in that one movie she did.

575
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
 - Monster, I think.

576
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,520
 - Oh, Monster's Ball.

577
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,360
 - Monster's Ball, that's it.

578
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,560
 - Yeah.

579
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,760
 Wow.

580
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,640
 - Well, my rate is similar.

581
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
 - There's also a five in it.

582
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
 - No, it wasn't Monster's Ball.

583
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 Monster's Ball was artsy.

584
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,800
 There's a movie where she basically like,

585
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,920
 like someone goes like, hello.

586
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
 And she just puts the thing,

587
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,800
 like it was like a big action movie.

588
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,400
 - Oh yeah, that's right.

589
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,320
 - Puts the sun thing down.

590
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,240
 She's just topples on the chair for like a split second.

591
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,280
 And apparently it was like a million dollars

592
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,560
 just to do that scene otherwise.

593
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,040
 Yeah, yeah.

594
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,400
 And then she did Monster's Ball just 'cause,

595
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,240
 I think just 'cause she wanted to hook up

596
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
 with Billy Bob Thornton.

597
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
 I think there was nothing else to it.

598
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,160
 - Oh, I get it.

599
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,800
 I mean, he's dreamy.

600
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,440
 - Now, Katie, you're also very shy about nudity,

601
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,280
 is that right?

602
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,860
 (all laughing)

603
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,200
 I was gonna say, Elaine,

604
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,720
 you probably talked to the one worst person to talk to

605
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,560
 if you're nervous about nudity on stage.

606
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,600
 - That's true.

607
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,960
 - Swordfish, by the way, swordfish.

608
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
 - Swordfish, that's it.

609
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

610
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
 - Oh yeah, swordfish.

611
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,880
 - I bet it was much more negotiable.

612
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,720
 I bet Katie was probably the hardest person to negotiate

613
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,560
 with.

614
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,660
 - Well, yeah, she was pro.

615
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,480
 (all laughing)

616
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,360
 - Well, Katie takes the term wiggle room personally.

617
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
 She's like, no, no, no, if there is room to wiggle,

618
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
 we shall wiggle.

619
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,080
 - The funny thing is when,

620
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,060
 oh, sorry, go ahead, Elaine.

621
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,900
 - No, you.

622
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,520
 - When they figured out how to do the topless,

623
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,080
 but not topless, I was the only one like,

624
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,000
 so I can't get my tits out now 'cause no one else is?

625
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
 All right.

626
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,120
 - So you hit your own deal breaker, Katie, you were the--

627
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,800
 - Well, I was gonna say, in the parking lot,

629
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,320
 post coming in and reading with everyone,

630
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,680
 I was like, she had me very close to convinced.

631
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,800
 I was like, well, or maybe, like.

632
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,080
 - Jacob, by March 1st, who knows, buddy?

633
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,920
 Who knows, pal?

634
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,320
 - That's right, that's right.

635
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
 We'll see.

636
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,640
 - You've been doing previews, how's it been going?

637
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,800
 - Good, really good.

638
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,720
 We've had great audiences.

639
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,680
 You know, some areas get like way bigger laughs

640
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,120
 than you expected, and then other areas you're like,

641
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,940
 okay, like this needs to be tweaked a little

642
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,440
 'cause it's not getting a reaction.

643
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
 So they've been helpful,

644
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,960
 and they've been supportive and good.

645
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
 - Yeah, I think parodies are hard that way.

646
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,960
 Parodies are, on the broad strokes, of course,

647
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,160
 it's like, it's very much a layup

648
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,520
 to obviously celebrate showgirls musically

649
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
 and everything is super fun.

650
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,340
 But yeah, parodies get really tricky

651
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,640
 because it's hard to figure out what fits in the box,

652
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,200
 like theatrically, but you're poking

653
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,760
 at the fourth wall the whole time.

654
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,600
 You're dealing with an audience

655
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,680
 that has the knowledge base of the material.

656
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,540
 Paul and I did "50 Shades of the Parody" together,

657
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,080
 so that's why we're talking about that,

658
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,880
 is that it was always strange to figure out

659
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,160
 what your relationship with the audience is,

660
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
 with the material.

661
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,580
 - Well, and also, it's a similar vibe

662
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,520
 with "50 Shades of the Parody,"

663
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 because we always joked,

664
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,040
 it's not really "50 Shades of the Parody,"

665
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,680
 it's just "50 Shades," and look how ridiculous this is.

666
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,760
 And I think there's probably a not dissimilar effect

667
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,600
 with some of showgirls. - All the craziness

668
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,840
 came from the source material, yeah, yeah.

669
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,480
 - Right, not too dissimilar effect

670
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,580
 probably coming from showgirls,

671
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,000
 because there are moments that it's just beyond,

672
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
 it is beyond parody, some of that film, yeah.

673
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,740
 - Right, I mean, like, direct from the script,

674
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,800
 you know, what's Al's line?

675
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
 Word for word, it's like--

676
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,880
 - It must be strange not having anybody come on you.

677
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,600
 (laughing)

678
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,980
 - Yes.

679
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,200
 - This is what I'm talking about.

680
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,040
 - Yeah. - Yes.

681
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,860
 - This is what I'm talking about.

682
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,700
 - Exactly.

683
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,680
 - And Paul, you relate to that line a lot, yeah.

684
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,500
 (laughing)

685
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,340
 - I was, I was.

686
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,800
 - Well, you're talking about source material.

687
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,880
 - Yeah, I mean. (laughing)

688
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
 - Exactly.

689
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,840
 - Yeah.

690
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,800
 - Playing Gina Gershaw's part, Katie,

691
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,880
 is it as fun as you thought it would be?

692
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,720
 More fun?

693
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,540
 Is it crazy?

694
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,380
 Is it hard?

695
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,800
 What was it like taking on this role

696
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,700
 10 years after not playing it?

697
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,040
 - There are parts of it that feel very, very natural.

698
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,000
 I will say, like, some of the things that I have to say

699
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,280
 to know me, Elaine, are difficult for me

700
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,080
 because Elaine is so, so goddamn funny.

701
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,920
 (laughing)

702
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,680
 It is difficult at times to,

703
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,040
 well, just not to laugh out loud on stage.

704
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,720
 Like, my very first scene with her,

705
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,080
 I say something and then she screams in my face

706
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,840
 and she runs over to a wall and slams herself into the wall.

707
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
 (laughing)

708
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,640
 And it's just like, that's probably the hardest part

709
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
 of being Crystal.

710
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,400
 Everything else is natural.

711
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
 - Was it a total head trip?

712
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,920
 'Cause you basically went from Maria

713
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,760
 to Baroness Von Schrapp, you know?

714
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,400
 So what's that shift like?

715
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,120
 What's mentally, do you find yourself,

716
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,640
 are you ever at times in opposition

717
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,480
 to the character you're playing in a way?

718
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,200
 What's the game there?

719
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,600
 - No, never, because as I've gotten older

720
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,760
 in the tidy space that is the classic showgirl world,

721
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,360
 I see all these young green girls coming in

722
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,120
 thinking they know everything.

723
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,400
 And so I have slowly just grown into Crystal.

724
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,760
 - I think that's just what happens, right?

725
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,280
 Like, you just grow up in the entertainment industry

726
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,040
 and you go like, yeah, that's just what people are now.

727
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
 I don't know what you want.

728
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
 - Yeah, yep, yep.

729
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,480
 - You've made us into this.

730
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,440
 - No, I was actually-- - That's exactly how I feel.

731
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,560
 This city and show business in this city

732
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,880
 made me into this.

733
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,560
 - I was just visiting with my mother-in-law

734
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,640
 and she, of course, was in "No No No Net" with Ruby Keeler

735
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,240
 when Ruby Keeler made her big triumphant return or whatever.

736
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,160
 And someone brought up,

737
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,680
 I'm trying to remember the name of the other,

738
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,160
 it was another movie star.

739
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,640
 And Ruby Keeler putting on her makeup quietly goes like,

740
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,080
 yes, but can she still do a thousand taps, blah, blah, blah,

741
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,160
 and just talk shit about this other movie star?

742
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,400
 And I was like, (laughing)

743
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,040
 based on that she's still an amazing tap shape

744
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,920
 at her age in her 60s.

745
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,760
 Basically, still out tap any other movie star.

746
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,280
 And I was like, man, this is the one who left show business

747
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,240
 and still kept her receipts.

748
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,360
 (laughing)

749
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
 - Oh yeah.

750
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,800
 - I left this whole thing.

751
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,160
 I came back, also, fuck you.

752
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,400
 (laughing)

753
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,080
 - And Elaine, yeah, my wife is working on the show as well

754
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,600
 and speaks so highly of your comedic background.

755
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,880
 Do you have a formal comedic background

756
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
 or are you just a funny person?

757
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,520
 - I started in theater and musical theater

758
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,040
 when I was a kid, I was like nine.

759
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,560
 I went to perform arts high school.

760
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,360
 And then I went to AMDA in New York for two years

761
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,360
 and I started working when I was 20 in 2007.

762
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,760
 And actually like 2008, 'cause I think I started taking

763
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,400
 at the People's Improv Theater in New York.

764
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,400
 And both Nate Starkey and Ashley Ward were teachers of mine.

765
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,720
 - Love those two, love those two.

766
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,320
 - Yeah, I know, me too, me too.

767
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,840
 And then when I moved to LA, I was kind of

768
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,480
 at the groundlings, like on and off,

769
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,760
 'cause sometimes I would take breaks between levels,

770
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,880
 but between 2012 and 2016.

771
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,720
 - That's a lot, that's not a small background,

772
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
 that's a big background.

773
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,560
 And actually, what groundlings training specifically,

774
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,400
 where Katie's describing, your groundlings training

775
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,320
 must be coming in very handy right now

776
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
 with these big choices.

777
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,840
 - I mean, I love, exactly, I love like groundlings style

778
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,320
 and like just characters and, you know, exactly.

779
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,720
 - For our listeners, like groundlings is always about

780
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,840
 like taking your choice, making it distinct,

781
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,240
 and then take it to a 10.

782
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,560
 Like that's basically what they're known for

783
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
 is take your smallest choice

784
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,560
 and then make it eat everything else in the character.

785
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,520
 Which is why so many of them are iconic

786
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,000
 from our old mad TV days to the ones

787
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
 that had the train that stuck out on "Saturday Night Live"

788
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 and stuff, it's like those are the,

789
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,360
 that kind of era of comedy where all sketch comedy

790
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,720
 was so character distinct

791
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,000
 was definitely because of groundlings.

792
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

793
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,680
 So, oh, so you're a heavy hitter.

794
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,040
 You're, I didn't realize you stuck with the,

795
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,240
 all the training in the post-pit, so that's exciting.

796
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,360
 - Yeah, it was great.

797
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,960
 Like I think that's my favorite thing in life

798
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,720
 is just, you know, like laughter of reflection, right?

799
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
 Because like it's the best way

800
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,040
 to connect with other people, I think.

801
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,880
 - Yeah, yeah, I think so.

802
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,520
 - Sometimes you do it on stage

803
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,680
 and sometimes you do it on the internet through food.

804
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,040
 (all laughing)

805
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,480
 But through, you are pushed, you know,

806
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,680
 through pushing the envelope, through tension spots

807
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,960
 and, you know, and messing with people,

808
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,120
 like you do figure out.

809
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,320
 - Through filling a kiddie pool with punch.

810
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,480
 - Yeah, like, no, I think when you surprise people,

811
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,520
 their real feelings burst, right?

812
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,320
 That's what standups do and everything else.

813
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,720
 It's like when you surprise people,

814
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,240
 their real feelings burst before they can rationalize.

815
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,200
 And so suddenly that's where you get like a real temperature,

816
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,240
 a real take of what's happening in the room.

817
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,040
 And when you're in a comedic environment,

818
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,960
 when we all get to laugh at that time, it's a relief.

819
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,120
 We're like, oh, good, we're all, we're all flawed.

820
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,000
 We're all laughing at this thing,

821
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,400
 which means we're all secretly maybe

822
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,360
 hiding our terribleness all the time.

823
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
 (all laughing)

824
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,040
 - Some of us doing a better job than others.

825
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,200
 - Speak for yourself.

826
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
 (all laughing)

827
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,720
 Hiding it.

828
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,080
 - Well, people who want to be decent are trying to hide it.

829
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,120
 (all laughing)

830
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,320
 - The time for that game has passed, my friend.

831
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,900
 (all laughing)

832
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,080
 - Well, I'm so excited to see the show tomorrow night.

833
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,920
 How long is it running?

834
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
 It's running at the Majestic Theater.

835
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
 We should tell people it's at the Majestic Theater.

836
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,280
 - Yes. - Downtown Los Vegas.

837
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,600
 - Downtown Arts District.

838
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,000
 Beautiful, beautiful Downtown Arts District.

839
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,240
 So much new stuff in that Downtown Arts District.

840
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,680
 Do yourself a favor, go see the show, get your tickets,

841
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,760
 get there like two hours early, walk around,

842
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,640
 find yourself something to eat,

843
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,680
 do a little shopping in the area,

844
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,720
 hang out after.

845
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,060
 There are a ton of bars right there.

846
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,800
 Again, in walking distance from the Majestic Theater.

847
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,280
 Yeah, it's really great.

848
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,560
 The whole area downtown there in the Arts District

849
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,680
 has just been blossoming.

850
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,080
 - It's a vibe.

851
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,240
 - And frankly, the Majestic is right there

852
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,920
 at the forefront of that blossoming.

853
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,400
 So, good job to them as always.

854
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,340
 - I love that theater.

855
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,760
 We know it's our favorite theater.

856
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,320
 - Oh, yes.

857
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
 - We beg Troy to perform there all the time.

858
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,840
 And so--

859
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,360
 (all laughing)

860
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,180
 - He won't do it.

861
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,300
 - I love that crazy environment.

862
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,880
 And how long is it running?

863
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,940
 - Through March 8th.

864
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,120
 - Through March 8th, all right.

865
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,600
 - Yeah, we've got every Thursday through Sunday

866
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,080
 from now until March 8th,

867
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,040
 and of course, special performance tomorrow night, so.

868
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,440
 - So cool, so cool.

869
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,280
 - Fantastic.

870
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,100
 - All right.

871
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,420
 - Anything.

872
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
 - We haven't early.

873
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,100
 (all laughing)

874
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,760
 - Yeah, Jacob wants everyone to come with shopping bags

875
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,600
 for some reason,

876
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,520
 but we'll figure that out as we go.

877
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,560
 - It's fine, it's fine.

878
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,920
 - Your favorite scene to do, Elaine,

879
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,720
 and then the same question to Katie.

880
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:32,360
 - Well, I really love when Katie and I see each other

881
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,720
 kind of for the first time outside of the dance off.

882
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,680
 I just think like, that's so much fun.

883
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,640
 And God, there's, I love the whole thing.

884
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,840
 Honestly, beginning to end,

885
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,000
 I love watching her song, "Constant Pain."

886
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,120
 I'm on stage for that,

887
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,280
 and I kind of get to just like watch.

888
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,680
 - Oh, that would have been a better question.

889
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,640
 Much easier to answer.

890
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,040
 Okay, Elaine, what's your favorite Katie scene,

891
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,280
 and Katie, what's your favorite Elaine scene?

892
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,100
 Much better.

893
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,940
 - There you go.

894
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,720
 - Elaine, you're a better podcaster than I am.

895
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,560
 Go ahead.

896
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,880
 - Well, definitely, like I said,

897
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,800
 Crystal's big solo ballad, "Constant Pain,"

898
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,720
 just so much fun.

899
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,040
 I think there's so many layers

900
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,000
 to what has been added in that song,

901
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,360
 and there's just things that crack me up.

902
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
 I mean, starting with the lyrics

903
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,080
 and what Katie's put on top of it,

904
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,920
 being a dancer, being a real showgirl.

905
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,040
 I just think that's a blast,

906
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
 and the audience is having so much fun at that moment.

907
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,760
 - Yeah.

908
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,600
 Katie?

909
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,200
 - For me, it's definitely when Elaine comes out

910
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,460
 to do a song called "Lapdancin."

911
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,320
 (laughing)

912
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,200
 The first time that she was just rehearsing it,

913
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,440
 I had to excuse myself

914
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,280
 because I was crying, laughing so hard

915
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,560
 that I was disruptive.

916
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,800
 'Cause I'm not gonna give it away,

917
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,480
 but the pole is, it plays a big part.

918
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,140
 Of course, she's gotta lick the pole,

919
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,000
 but it plays a big part in that number,

920
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,540
 and she just goes so full out,

921
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,560
 and it's so goddamn funny.

922
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,800
 (laughing)

923
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,560
 - I just wanna point out, yeah,

924
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,320
 much like Paul and I, when we did "Fat Chase," the parody,

925
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,920
 what was particularly great about it

926
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760
 was there's original music.

927
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,120
 You're not using typical parody songs,

928
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,560
 which is, a lot of parodies use typical mainstream songs

929
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,800
 just to kind of make fun of certain elements or whatever,

930
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,920
 but this is all originally scored, right?

931
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,240
 - Yes.

932
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,080
 - That's pretty cool.

933
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,680
 So yeah, a lot of great songs in it.

934
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,660
 I can't wait to check it out.

935
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,600
 Well, thank you guys for coming by

936
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,800
 and checking out "Ice Cream Social,"

937
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,160
 and we'll put all the links and all that

938
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,800
 into our bio and stuff,

939
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,320
 and people have plenty of opportunities

940
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,480
 to go see the show "Downtown Vegas."

941
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
 Hope you guys have an amazing run.

942
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,820
 - Yes.

943
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,660
 - Thank you. - Thank you so much.

944
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,500
 Thanks for having us.

945
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,760
 - Break all the legs, y'all.

946
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,600
 - Come see us. - Thank you, Matt.

947
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,800
 - Oh, we will.

948
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,960
 - Thank you, everybody.

949
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,600
 I'll tell you who else is gonna go see

950
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,560
 "Showgirls, the Musical Parody

951
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,800
 at the Downtown Majestic Theater,"

952
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,920
 and that is the following sponsor.

953
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,880
 - Today's show, Matt and Madeline's "Ice Cream Social,"

954
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,680
 is brought to you by Yo-Yo Ma's Yo-Yo Mart.

955
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,580
 That's right, from 2021.

956
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,160
 This is from one of the Wills.

957
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,100
 Yo-Yo Ma's Yo-Yo Mart.

958
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,280
 ("Ice Cream Social")

959
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:31,400
 - Hello, it is I, Yo-Yo Ma.

960
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,200
 Master of the cello.

961
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,280
 What I'd like you to do

962
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,920
 is shut off your brain for a moment

963
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,760
 and hear the sound of a cello

964
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,880
 as it's played by one of Yo-Yo Ma's specialty yo-yos.

965
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,960
 This is a Duncan Wonder Ball.

966
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,080
 (yodeling)

967
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:04,880
 I bang it into the instrument.

968
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
 That's all I can do with it.

969
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,440
 Now, Yo-Yo Ma will walk the dog.

970
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
 (yodeling)

971
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:20,320
 And now, I will do "Baby in the Cradle."

972
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,480
 (yodeling)

973
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,320
 Yo-Yo Ma's Yo-Yos from Yo-Yo Ma's Yo-Yo Mart

974
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,840
 are coated with a special resin

975
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,440
 that give them a resonance.

976
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,000
 But when you spin that yo-yo,

977
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,960
 when you go around the world,

978
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,440
 you really go around the world musically

979
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,000
 with Yo-Yo Ma's Yo-Yo Mart yo-yos.

980
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,760
 - Enter Hey Scoop's Checkout.

981
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,000
 (laughing)

982
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,360
 I don't know where I expected that to go, but yeah.

983
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
 - I'm just a better person having listened to it,

984
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,200
 so it doesn't matter.

985
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,040
 I'm just a more mature.

986
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,480
 - Where else is it gonna go?

987
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,320
 - This is it.

988
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,720
 - O.G. Scoop in the chat mat is pointing out,

989
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,120
 "Didn't your wife do something with the Showgirls show?"

990
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,960
 - My wife is the choreographer,

991
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,280
 but I didn't wanna flex my family's involvement

992
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,360
 with the show.

993
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,200
 I just--

994
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,280
 - No, no, we're just people to go see the thing.

995
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

996
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,680
 I think Sarah and Troy have talked about

997
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,040
 working on different projects for a while now,

998
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,480
 and then, as you know, Disco closed.

999
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,920
 Sarah had free time, and nature abhors a vacuum.

1000
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,760
 - Sure.

1001
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,640
 Nature and Sarah abhor a vacuum.

1002
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,920
 - And so Sarah filled that time immediately

1003
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
 with Showgirls and working on Showgirls.

1004
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,840
 - Didn't she agree to do it

1005
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,640
 before Disco Show closed, though?

1006
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,840
 (laughing)

1007
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
 - Yes.

1008
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,160
 - I think she agreed to do Showgirls

1009
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,280
 before she had the time to do it.

1010
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,080
 (laughing)

1011
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,240
 - That's how you get things done, I suppose.

1012
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,040
 - I guess so, I guess so.

1013
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
 - Yeah, so the timing worked out.

1014
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,840
 Timing worked out, but yeah, yeah.

1015
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,240
 So we can't wait to...

1016
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,080
 There we go.

1017
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,320
 So, yeah, I'm so excited.

1018
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,920
 I mean, I love that show.

1019
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,480
 I saw a parody of it in New York back in the day

1020
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,480
 that wasn't a musical, that was just hysterical, too,

1021
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,320
 and I just...

1022
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,480
 - Nice.

1023
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,040
 - Well, I will tell you that no one actually loves that show

1024
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,240
 more than my friend.

1025
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,440
 Maybe I won't name him for the story,

1026
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,440
 but he was dating a stripper,

1027
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,880
 and they wanted to watch it together,

1028
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,880
 and he took ecstasy when he was rolling, when he watched it.

1029
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
 (laughing)

1030
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,960
 And then he was watching it,

1031
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,400
 and he thought it was so beautiful and significant,

1032
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,520
 and then he was looking at his girlfriend

1033
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,400
 not react that way.

1034
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,760
 And so he was leaning over to his side

1035
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,680
 and secretly texting and calling his friends

1036
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,800
 to express how amazing and important Showgirls was.

1037
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,720
 - Well, I've watched, actually,

1038
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,120
 'cause that was Paul Verhoeven who directed that.

1039
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,960
 - That's right, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,960
 - That's the man behind Robocop.

1041
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,240
 - Yes, yeah.

1042
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,680
 - Like, and if you look at it,

1043
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,280
 like I've watched some really interesting

1044
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,520
 commentaries online,

1045
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,920
 where they kind of deconstruct what's going on.

1046
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,800
 It's nuts, the stuff that he was,

1047
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,880
 the messages he was putting in there

1048
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,440
 that didn't necessarily translate for a lot of reasons.

1049
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,080
 - No, I mean, that is what's fascinating about it.

1050
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,200
 If you want to look into it at all,

1051
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,640
 is like, I forget what kind of filmmaking it was,

1052
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,520
 but it used to be when you watched student filmmaking,

1053
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,920
 you watch whatever films from another country

1054
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,120
 where if they showed a wine bottle,

1055
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,400
 it was supposed to mean something.

1056
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,640
 Every little image is actually supposed

1057
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,120
 to be the significant meaning,

1058
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
 and it never translates to the watcher

1059
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,320
 unless you know it ahead of time.

1060
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,320
 - Unless you have also studied that filmmaking method.

1061
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,800
 - This film is filled with it.

1062
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,640
 It is filled with trying to make this

1063
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,920
 such a significant story,

1064
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,520
 and it just is known for it's like crazy backstage antics,

1065
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,560
 and then of course, bizarre sex scenes.

1066
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,600
 - But let me posit this to you guys.

1067
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,400
 Let me just say like if the three of us

1068
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,440
 were tasked with making "Showgirls,"

1069
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,040
 the year is 1990, whatever it was,

1070
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,960
 and somebody comes to the three of us and says,

1071
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,280
 "Okay, you guys are gonna make this 'Showgirls' pick.

1072
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,680
 "We got the girl from 'Saved by the Bell.'

1073
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,520
 "She's gonna be in it.

1074
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,800
 "We got all these other people they're gonna be in it.

1075
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,400
 "It's Vegas, 'Showgirls,' blah, blah, blah."

1076
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,680
 We'd go, "Great, we're gonna start looking into this world."

1077
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,480
 And as soon as you start looking into that world,

1078
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,520
 there is so much interesting stuff.

1079
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,040
 There's genuinely all of this incredibly interesting stuff

1080
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,440
 in exotic dancing, in the "Showgirl" world,

1081
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,800
 and in Las Vegas entertainment.

1082
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,640
 - Oh, like this--

1083
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,280
 - If you want to try to communicate

1084
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,040
 all of that interesting material to the audience,

1085
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,960
 it's just not a thing that's really communicable.

1086
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,320
 - No, I think-- - Unlike most things

1087
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,480
 in the movie "Showgirls," which are very communicable.

1088
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,480
 - I think, yeah, I think that if this comes out years later,

1089
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,560
 it's more fascinating as a prestige television show.

1090
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,440
 - Yeah, I mean, it's a history document.

1091
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,120
 - Yeah, yeah, I think you really see the world

1092
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,080
 through the life of the actual occupation of a "Showgirl."

1093
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,760
 Obviously, the movie came out last, "Showgirl."

1094
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,680
 People are, Taylor Swift just named her album "Showgirl."

1095
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,400
 There's still a fascination with this,

1096
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,320
 and I think largely right now, because it's going away.

1097
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,680
 Larger right now because of that kind of idea

1098
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,880
 of putting together some kind of really big production show

1099
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,520
 with pageantry and that being something

1100
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,640
 that attracts modern audiences is going away.

1101
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,360
 Now we need celebrities and IP and all this other stuff

1102
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,360
 to make people want to see something, I think, you know.

1103
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,080
 I think the largest driver of tourism right now

1104
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,000
 is the fucking "Wizard of Oz," right?

1105
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,760
 Like for Las Vegas, right?

1106
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,640
 So it's like, I think we have this fascination of this era

1107
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,240
 that is closing out, right?

1108
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,080
 Even Dita Von Teese opened up her show over at Bally's,

1109
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,440
 and the big discovery was that all of those, is it Mac?

1110
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,880
 What's the name of the famous costumer?

1111
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,720
 - Bob Mackie.

1112
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,240
 - Yeah, Mackie, Mackie, you know.

1113
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,080
 - Bob Mackie, yeah.

1114
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,280
 - All this is just--

1115
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,080
 - Dita's show was in the Jubilee showroom at Bally's.

1116
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,920
 - Right.

1117
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,680
 - And they were using a lot of the old Jubilee costumes.

1118
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,960
 I'm just filling people in on what you're saying.

1119
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
 - No, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm trying to let you also.

1120
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,840
 I didn't mean to be like, yeah, I knew that, brr.

1121
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,480
 - Yeah, but no, they were in the Jubilee showroom

1122
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,040
 where Jubilee had been since the '60s, I want to say,

1123
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,920
 '60s or '70s, and closed, like I have,

1124
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,640
 I've got pictures on my phone somewhere

1125
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,000
 of them taking the Jubilee sign down outside of Bally's.

1126
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,840
 - Right.

1127
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,280
 - Just 'cause it was right across the street.

1128
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,800
 And so we'd just watch this happen every night.

1129
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,960
 And Jubilee was a show that, I mean, I saw,

1130
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,080
 I don't even know how many dozens of times I saw Jubilee.

1131
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,240
 And so like Dita's show going in there

1132
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,600
 with all of the costumes,

1133
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,000
 and Katie mentioned a little bit, like with the height stick.

1134
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,760
 And I think I'd even talked about this,

1135
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,360
 seeing Dita's show when they were doing it.

1136
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,880
 It was so neat with Jubilee because it was,

1137
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,200
 it was this beautiful exhibition of,

1138
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,400
 you know, here are all these people,

1139
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,640
 and we have gotten a group of people

1140
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,560
 that we can get to look as identical as we can

1141
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,560
 and still have a hundred people on stage,

1142
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,080
 but we're getting them to look as identical as we can

1143
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,680
 with the height and the build and everything else.

1144
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,240
 And then we're just gonna display these costumes on them.

1145
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,080
 - Yeah.

1146
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,160
 - And so to see that, and so to see Dita then take that

1147
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,360
 and say, we're gonna get people who look as different

1148
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,600
 as everyone just truly looks.

1149
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,240
 We're not gonna do any of that nonsense of trying,

1150
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,200
 and not nonsense, it's not fair, different time.

1151
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
 But like, we're not gonna do any of that stuff

1152
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,640
 where we're just displaying the costume.

1153
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,480
 We're gonna display the people as well.

1154
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,280
 And so Dita having people that were of kind of every shape

1155
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,280
 and size up there wearing these costumes that for decades

1156
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,440
 and from my whole experience had been like,

1157
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,920
 no, you have to look like this to wear these costumes.

1158
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,120
 It was a neat thing to watch history kind of get turned

1159
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,040
 on its head a little bit with Dita's stuff.

1160
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,840
 But then yeah, I think you're onto something though.

1161
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,280
 I don't know how interesting that was to the lay person.

1162
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
 - Right.

1163
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,280
 I mean, it was, I think that it through its efforts

1164
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,880
 became iconic stamp on like what to go see in Vegas.

1165
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,720
 - Yeah.

1166
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,400
 - When you were there, like, and I think part of it

1167
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,240
 was the toplessness and then that kind of stuff.

1168
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,080
 - Sure.

1169
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,000
 - But I think that era where you tried to meet

1170
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,920
 in the middle, right?

1171
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,000
 It was like, sure, you're gonna stop us

1172
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,880
 but we're actually gonna show you production anyway.

1173
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,200
 We're going to value and you're not,

1174
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,600
 it's not going to be lurid.

1175
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,440
 It's not going to be sexual.

1176
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,520
 - Well, I mean, that scene in "Rocky IV"

1177
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,240
 when Apollo Creed is coming out and the huge production thing

1178
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,960
 with the bull that collapses and all that stuff,

1179
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,760
 that's just a scene out of Jubilee.

1180
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,600
 - It is.

1181
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,240
 - They do that shot that's in the Jubilee theater

1182
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,560
 where they do that shot.

1183
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,440
 And they just did a scene from Jubilee

1184
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,640
 and put Apollo Creed in front of it

1185
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,080
 and put a boxing ring in front of it.

1186
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,840
 But I mean, that's what they did every night.

1187
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,680
 - Yeah.

1188
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,920
 - It was crazy.

1189
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,840
 - No, you're talking about like, Dita,

1190
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,800
 they basically had those costumes just locked up.

1191
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,480
 There was no one in charge of preserving them.

1192
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,760
 And so basically that production company was like, good Lord.

1193
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,760
 And tried to like preserve as much of it as they could

1194
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,960
 and do whatever.

1195
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,960
 And we don't, we still right now don't have like a museum

1196
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,680
 or a preservation space for these iconic costumes of-

1197
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,280
 - This was the same kind of difficulties and travesty

1198
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,240
 that happened when they closed down the experience.

1199
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,120
 There were so many pieces of memorabilia,

1200
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,760
 the Jimi Hendrix experience.

1201
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,440
 So there were so many pieces of memorabilia

1202
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,720
 and actual legit costumes and you know,

1203
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,080
 not to mention all the replica stuff

1204
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,320
 that just a lot of it went in the fucking trash.

1205
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,200
 - Oh, I mean, I was working at the Tropicana

1206
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,400
 after Follies Brejere closed,

1207
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,880
 which was the kind of the sister show to Jubilee.

1208
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,720
 It was the other big showgirl show in town.

1209
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,760
 And I mean, I found a room one day,

1210
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,440
 maybe a year after Follies had closed,

1211
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,440
 that just had basically all the costumes

1212
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,800
 that had been worn on the final night.

1213
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,360
 They had just taken all those costumes

1214
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,640
 as soon as people got off stage

1215
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,280
 and throwing them into boxes and closed them up.

1216
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,800
 They hadn't washed them, they hadn't laundered them,

1217
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,640
 they hadn't dried cleaned them,

1218
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,200
 they hadn't even dried them out.

1219
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,200
 And so like they were all sweaty, they had mildewed,

1220
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,760
 like they had just rotted.

1221
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,080
 It was horrible.

1222
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,200
 - Well, you know, we'll save the day.

1223
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,080
 There's a silver bullet, we own it.

1224
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,920
 We own the silver bullet, guys.

1225
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,320
 - What's the silver bullet?

1226
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,680
 - Chapeau, Chapeau was our production show.

1227
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,200
 - Chapeau could do it.

1228
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,720
 I mean, we've got the first number written.

1229
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,560
 - Chapeau would do it.

1230
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,400
 - We've got the first number written.

1231
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,240
 - Seduction Escalated.

1232
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,080
 - We're practically there.

1233
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,840
 - Yeah, Seduction Escalated, we're right there.

1234
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,680
 - It's halfway there.

1235
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,500
 - We are.

1236
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,520
 - It's halfway there.

1237
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,200
 - I'll tell you who else is halfway up

1238
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,920
 that escalator to success.

1239
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,840
 And they're gonna slap on those butt cheeks

1240
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,480
 to show their appreciation.

1241
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,040
 And that's the following sponsor.

1242
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,120
 - Today's show, Matt and Madly's Ice Cream Social

1243
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,120
 is brought to you by RFK Junior's Throat Worm Based Losages.

1244
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,760
 That's from Scoop of Monte Cristo in 2025.

1245
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,960
 This is RFK Junior's Throat Worm Based Losages.

1246
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,280
 - Uh, it's, it's, (coughing)

1247
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,920
 it's, it's golden flu season.

1248
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,480
 It's golden flu season.

1249
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,520
 And, oh, milk.

1250
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,760
 (groaning)

1251
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:02,440
 - Ladies and gentlemen, it has been determined

1252
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,440
 that RFK Junior is in fact Jabba the Hutt

1253
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,680
 being choked to death by Princess Leia

1254
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,680
 from Return of the Jedi.

1255
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,360
 His death scene on the, on the sailing barge

1256
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,880
 is a literal translation of verbiage from the future

1257
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,880
 from our Department of Health and Human Services Commandant.

1258
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,600
 - Enter HeyScoops at checkout.

1259
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,720
 (groaning)

1260
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,120
 I didn't know an ad was gonna get us sued by JFK

1261
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,880
 and Disney all at the same time.

1262
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,120
 (laughing)

1263
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,600
 So I got some firewood delivered to my house.

1264
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,480
 The other day.

1265
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,280
 - Firewood delivery, huh?

1266
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,320
 - Firewood delivery.

1267
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,000
 So what I usually do, 'cause we have a fireplace

1268
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,200
 in the house, we use that to keep the house warm

1269
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,080
 during the, during the winter time

1270
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,560
 so we don't have to run the heat so much.

1271
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,880
 - Oh yeah, that's that bitter,

1272
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,520
 that bitter vague is cold, it'll get you.

1273
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,360
 - That's right, that's right.

1274
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,440
 You know, it'll get down into the 50s sometime.

1275
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,840
 - Paul, we are in show business.

1276
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,320
 We put on productions.

1277
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,440
 Fire is an element that we have

1278
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,720
 as like part of our hosting abilities

1279
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,320
 while we all come over in our short sleeve shirts

1280
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,520
 for our winter barbecues.

1281
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,480
 - In the backyard.

1282
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,600
 - The barbecue, exactly.

1283
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,720
 Hey, I, believe me, I fucking miss it this year.

1284
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,680
 It's already been just shit.

1285
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,040
 We drove yesterday to go visit with my in-laws

1286
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,520
 to go have dinner at this '80s diner.

1287
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,800
 It was kinda cool.

1288
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,400
 It was all '80s vibe, you know,

1289
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,920
 like they had Ghostbusters and shit on the wall.

1290
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,120
 - Oh, like an '80s diner.

1291
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,440
 - Like an '80s thing.

1292
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,760
 So really good food. - But like in which decade?

1293
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,720
 - Like '94, '95. - The one right before the '90s.

1294
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,160
 - I mean, it really, but it is, right?

1295
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,520
 Like the '80s retro stuff is all

1296
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,560
 the '90s idealization of the '80s.

1297
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,480
 It's not what the '80s was.

1298
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,920
 The '80s was really '70s couches in a basement

1299
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,360
 with a big ass TV and a Nintendo hooked up to it.

1300
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,080
 That's what the '80s was.

1301
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,000
 It wasn't all fucking day glow triangle.

1302
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,280
 - What's your story, Paul?

1303
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,120
 - Listen.

1304
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,600
 (laughing)

1305
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,600
 I'm telling you--

1306
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,440
 - Paul telling us what the '80s wasn't.

1307
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,920
 - We're getting ready to go.

1308
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,000
 - You know what else the '80s wasn't?

1309
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,160
 - And the phone alert system goes,

1310
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,000
 "Hey, snow squall warning."

1311
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,840
 - Ah, snow squall?

1312
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,680
 - Yeah.

1313
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,000
 So Anne's like, "Let's pump the brakes

1314
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,360
 "on the snow squall warning.

1315
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,240
 "Let's not leave until the snow squall warning is done."

1316
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,120
 So it finishes about 10 minutes after we were going to leave.

1317
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,320
 So she texts our relatives and,

1318
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,120
 "Hey, we're heading up there now."

1319
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,240
 We get in the car, we get on the highway.

1320
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,160
 We're on the highway about three minutes

1321
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,320
 and snow squalls are coming.

1322
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,160
 It just--

1323
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,000
 - So many snow squalls.

1324
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 - It just did not stop.

1325
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,160
 And I was like, this is, I mean, it was literally like,

1326
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,160
 I don't know, 70 feet visibility, maybe, maybe 60.

1327
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,320
 - Okay.

1328
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,400
 - It was pretty intense.

1329
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,680
 - Maybe 65?

1330
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,240
 - Eh, I'm gonna give it 30.

1331
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,080
 How about that?

1332
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,640
 30 feet visibility.

1333
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,480
 - Great.

1334
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,320
 - It was bad.

1335
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,400
 It was really bad.

1336
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,440
 And then the sun would kind of try and peek out

1337
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,120
 and make it even more of like a white washing.

1338
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,280
 I can't see fucking shit.

1339
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,800
 Anyway, we finally get to the restaurant

1340
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,120
 and about a minute before we get to the restaurant,

1341
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
 it stops.

1342
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,600
 Like literally on the road to the restaurant,

1343
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,960
 the squalls stop.

1344
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,600
 And I get out and I look at my phone and I go--

1345
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,400
 - All in all, we're just trying to eat in the squall.

1346
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,680
 - We were.

1347
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,760
 I look at my fucking phone and I was like,

1348
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,560
 oh look, Ann, they issued a squall warning again

1349
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,280
 about 40 minutes ago during our drive.

1350
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,560
 She said, can you text them fuck you?

1351
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,680
 - Can you reply to that text?

1352
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,360
 - I would like nothing, like to do nothing more.

1353
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,200
 - I got this at my kid's school

1354
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,480
 where they always issue, if any bus is late,

1355
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,760
 the entire school gets a late bus alert.

1356
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,520
 And I go like, at this point,

1357
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,520
 we should just get alerts for when the buses are on time.

1358
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,520
 - Right, hey, everything's going to plan.

1359
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,200
 Right, every other day, you know that shit's happening.

1360
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,160
 So yeah.

1361
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,720
 - I like that maybe there was a guy at the weather service

1362
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,920
 who was hard of hearing.

1363
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,320
 And every time anyone said anything, he's like,

1364
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,320
 what, squall warning?

1365
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,680
 Oh, I'll send it out.

1366
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,240
 Wait, what'd you say?

1367
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,600
 - Hit the squall button.

1368
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,240
 - Squall button, bang.

1369
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,720
 - The fact that they cut off the squall warning

1370
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,960
 and then issued it again like five minutes later.

1371
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,920
 As soon as we got off the road, they started it up again.

1372
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,640
 Like, fuck you.

1373
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,440
 - So yeah, I'm not a fan of this winter bullshit.

1374
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:48,440
 - I travel a lot and so sometimes planes are delayed.

1375
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,720
 The only airline I know that will delay a plane

1376
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,200
 and then go nevermind, actually we're leaving early,

1377
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,080
 is Southwest.

1378
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,320
 Everyone else, if your plane delayed,

1379
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,800
 then it's just delayed.

1380
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,360
 But with Southwest, if your plane's delayed,

1381
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,520
 you're like, don't go anywhere.

1382
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,480
 Because they might just turn around and be like,

1383
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,400
 nevermind, it's all here, we're going.

1384
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,320
 - They do, they do, they do.

1385
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,840
 Again, spoiled on the fucking Southwest, man.

1386
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,960
 I love my Southwest.

1387
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,880
 - So most years I go, I take the truck

1388
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,520
 and I go pick up firewood.

1389
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,360
 - Yes.

1390
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,840
 - And there are these services in town.

1391
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,680
 - That's what I thought, Jacob.

1392
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,280
 I thought you were a man, you know?

1393
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,120
 I thought you went out and got you fired.

1394
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,240
 - That's the thing, so every year I've done this,

1395
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,040
 every year I've done this,

1396
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,080
 this year I couldn't find anywhere that would let me do it.

1397
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,760
 - Wouldn't let you pick up firewood?

1398
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,080
 - They wouldn't let me pick up firewood.

1399
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,880
 Everywhere is doing deliveries.

1400
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
 And I asked one guy, I was like, what's going on with this?

1401
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,560
 And he goes, oh, some people are, they'll come pick it up

1402
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,800
 and then they'll drive it somewhere and resell it.

1403
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
 Like on their own.

1404
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,620
 - Oh.

1405
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,840
 - This is the economy we're living in, guys.

1406
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,600
 - And my response to that was, so what?

1407
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,480
 - You're still selling them a truckload of firewood.

1408
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,000
 - I agree.

1409
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,840
 - Like, so why can't I buy a truckload of firewood?

1410
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,680
 - Oh my God, that's funny.

1411
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,760
 - I would call your wood people and be like,

1412
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,960
 look, Ticketmaster couldn't figure this out.

1413
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,080
 You can't either.

1414
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,520
 - Pokemon can't.

1415
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,840
 Pokemon can't figure it out.

1416
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,280
 That's, there's a whole economy

1417
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,400
 based around reselling Pokemon shit.

1418
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,600
 - You can't help it.

1419
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,560
 - Half of the, half of our current economy

1420
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,200
 is reselling Pokemon cards.

1421
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,620
 - So I have this area in my shop, in my garage,

1422
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,440
 that is the firewood pile.

1423
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,680
 And it's a big area there,

1424
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,800
 and we pile all the firewood up there every year,

1425
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,560
 and it's there, it's indoors a little bit,

1426
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,680
 like we don't have to go outside

1427
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,840
 to go get it during the winter time, it's nice.

1428
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,600
 And so he pulls up in his truck,

1429
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,440
 and he takes one look at where the firewood is gonna go,

1430
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,400
 and he goes, "Oh, that's not gonna fit."

1431
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,440
 (laughing)

1432
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,920
 And I go, and I say, very confidently,

1433
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,640
 "Don't worry, I do this every year."

1434
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,480
 And I point at my truck,

1435
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,080
 which is the same size as the truck

1436
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,000
 that he just pulled up in, so I'm feeling good.

1437
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,480
 I was like, I go load that truck up every year

1438
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,800
 with firewood, I stack it all right here,

1439
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,400
 we'll stack it up, and we'll put it in front of each other,

1440
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,360
 and it doesn't look like it'll fit,

1441
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,720
 but trust me, it'll fit.

1442
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,960
 And he goes, "Oh, okay, great."

1443
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,280
 And we start unloading the firewood,

1444
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,080
 and we start stacking it up.

1445
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,160
 (laughing)

1446
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,000
 He was correct.

1447
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,360
 (laughing)

1448
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,200
 I was gonna say, the fact that he was like, "All right,"

1449
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,600
 was basically like, you know.

1450
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,200
 - Let's go then.

1451
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,640
 - You used to be equivalent of someone

1452
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,240
 who works at a restaurant every day,

1453
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,640
 and the customer going like, "I eat here all the time."

1454
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,160
 And you're like, "No, I work here all the time."

1455
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,560
 And you don't, you just don't.

1456
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,600
 - He is a professional wood stacker,

1457
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,600
 as you are a biannual wood stacker, yes, yes.

1458
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,000
 - An amateur at best.

1459
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,840
 - Yes.

1460
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,080
 (laughing)

1461
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,840
 - And so we got kind of the main space

1462
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,160
 of firewood storage area filled up.

1463
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,000
 - Yeah.

1464
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 - And I looked at his truck, I turned to look,

1465
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,120
 'cause he was kind of like bringing wood to me

1466
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,120
 while I was stacking it.

1467
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,960
 - Yeah, and more to come.

1468
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,680
 - And so I wasn't really paying attention to the truck.

1469
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,240
 And so I turned and looked at the truck,

1470
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,760
 and keep in mind, the area that I usually fill up

1471
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,440
 with firewood is now about halfway filled up.

1472
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,280
 (laughing)

1473
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,920
 At this point, I have filled up about half

1474
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,760
 of the normal load that I bring in to this.

1475
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,080
 - Oh, so you were wrong by like a great deal.

1476
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,960
 You were wrong by a significant percentage.

1477
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,800
 - A great deal, a great deal.

1478
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,520
 - But you said they're the same size truck.

1479
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,560
 - Turns out, when you just have four guys

1480
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,160
 throwing pieces of firewood into your truck willy nilly,

1481
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,960
 and just stacking them, a lot less firewood fits in it

1482
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,520
 than when one guy very carefully goes through

1483
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,400
 and stacks all the firewood into the truck,

1484
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,000
 getting as much firewood into the truck as possible.

1485
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,120
 - Oh, okay.

1486
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,280
 So this is a stack packaging issue.

1487
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,200
 - Do you think you have more than a year's worth

1488
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,160
 of firewood here then?

1489
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,120
 - Oh, yes.

1490
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,760
 Not only do I have more than a year's worth

1491
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,520
 of firewood currently at my house,

1492
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,480
 I have more firewood that I've already paid for

1493
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,840
 at this guy's establishment that now that he knows me,

1494
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,320
 I can just go pull up in the truck and he will load it.

1495
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,640
 He was like, we stacked as much as we could.

1496
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,000
 I was like, I'm gonna call it.

1497
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,200
 There was still maybe a third.

1498
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,520
 - You don't have an account on Truth Social, right?

1499
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,360
 - No, no.

1500
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,800
 - Okay, you should get one because what happens

1501
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,160
 is they're gonna eventually need to start paying

1502
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,040
 some people to host book burning barnies.

1503
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,920
 And so you should make sure

1504
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,760
 that you're on the forefront of that.

1505
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,960
 - Jesus Christ. - Get on the cutting edge.

1506
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,480
 - You can get on the, any book that mentions

1507
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,520
 the word gay or trans or whatever,

1508
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,520
 or a black person or country has slavery at one point.

1509
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,120
 That's all gonna get burned.

1510
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,120
 - That's all gonna get burned.

1511
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,600
 And you know what they're gonna need for that?

1512
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,960
 Firewood.

1513
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,040
 - Exactly.

1514
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,920
 I mean, it's strange for me to be telling you

1515
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,920
 to be profiting in these strange times,

1516
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,040
 but I'm just looking out for you, man.

1517
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,760
 You know, we gotta pivot.

1518
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,160
 Sometimes we just have to pivot.

1519
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,880
 - You gotta pivot.

1520
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,080
 - We gotta Jeremy pivot.

1521
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,960
 - Jeremy pivot.

1522
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,400
 - So, okay, okay.

1523
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,360
 Wait, so where are you?

1524
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,200
 Where are you loading up when you're realizing

1525
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,440
 this failure of loading your truck properly is happening?

1526
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,280
 Where are you?

1527
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,440
 Where is this?

1528
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,560
 - This is at the house.

1529
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,400
 - Is that your house?

1530
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,480
 - So he brings the truck,

1531
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,440
 'cause they won't let me come pick it up.

1532
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,680
 So he brings a truckload to the house,

1533
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,560
 but he has packed the truck in such a way

1534
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,280
 that he has filled every space in the truck.

1535
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,520
 - Every nook and cranny is firewooded.

1536
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,360
 - When the guys fill my truck up,

1537
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,280
 when I go pick it up,

1538
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,000
 I basically pull up, hand 'em like $60,

1539
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,920
 and they just, like four dudes,

1540
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,120
 just start throwing pieces of firewood

1541
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,720
 into the bed of the truck.

1542
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,600
 I'm always a little worried that my truck

1543
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,480
 is going to get damaged when they're loading it.

1544
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,320
 - Get out of here.

1545
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,160
 Really?

1546
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,000
 - That's how they're loading it.

1547
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,840
 (laughing)

1548
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,040
 That's the way in which they're loading this.

1549
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,800
 This guy had like carefully packed all this firewood

1550
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,920
 into the bed of his truck.

1551
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,880
 And I mean, it had to have been three times

1552
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,160
 as much as I usually get into mine.

1553
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,000
 - Same price.

1554
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,120
 - Easily.

1555
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,100
 A little more expensive,

1556
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,280
 but definitely worth the extra cost.

1557
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,120
 - Wow.

1558
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,960
 But you're at your house.

1559
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,800
 - I'm at my house.

1560
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,680
 So we're stacking it up in my house.

1561
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,860
 - Okay.

1562
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,280
 - And we got, there was maybe a quarter or so

1563
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,560
 of his truck bed left, and I called it.

1564
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,760
 I was like, I can't.

1565
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,080
 Like I'm going to have to start moving shit around

1566
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,520
 to find places for firewood now.

1567
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,840
 And I knew that he was close by

1568
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,240
 because we had already talked about it.

1569
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,520
 I was like, you're going to do more deliveries

1570
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,000
 with this truck tomorrow, right?

1571
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,840
 He said, yeah.

1572
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,040
 So I said, if I leave firewood in your truck,

1573
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,200
 that doesn't screw you up on your later deliveries

1574
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,020
 that you're doing tomorrow.

1575
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,440
 He said, nope, I'm already partway loaded then.

1576
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,480
 That's all that means.

1577
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,680
 He said, great.

1578
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,920
 Said, can I just come pick up about this much firewood

1579
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,200
 later on from your place,

1580
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,760
 which is right down the road from my house?

1581
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,680
 - Yeah.

1582
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,320
 - And he goes, yes, you can.

1583
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,400
 And he looks at it.

1584
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,220
 He goes, that's about two and a half wheelbarrow loads

1585
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,700
 of a firewood that I owe you.

1586
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,960
 - You should argue with it right there.

1587
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,760
 You'd be like, nah, I think it's, nah, nah.

1588
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,720
 - No, this sounds like he was very gracious in victory.

1589
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,480
 - Hold on, I've got a wheelbarrow in the back.

1590
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,080
 We'll load it up and test this out.

1591
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,160
 - This guy was very gracious in victory.

1592
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,000
 - He was.

1593
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,820
 - Yeah.

1594
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,660
 - He certainly was.

1595
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,500
 He was very gracious.

1596
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,000
 - I just like, he had a second opportunity

1597
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,640
 to misjudge his call again.

1598
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,720
 - I mean, he did miss the runner, but still.

1599
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,040
 I mean, if you two are the only ones that are getting it,

1600
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,760
 he's just like, eh.

1601
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,680
 - I mean, at that point, I'm like, whatever you say, man.

1602
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,440
 I'm not disagreeing with a single word you have to say.

1603
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,800
 If you tell me that I should be using

1604
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,120
 a different type of wood, great.

1605
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,400
 Load all this up, take it away.

1606
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,520
 Bring me whatever you think.

1607
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,680
 I just agree with you.

1608
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,160
 - Holy smoke. - Amazing, amazing.

1609
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,240
 - Oh, I went back in the house.

1610
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,080
 And later on, SJ gets home.

1611
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,760
 And I was like, you see that giant pile of firewood?

1612
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,720
 She goes, yeah.

1613
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,520
 Said, we have more coming.

1614
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,560
 (laughing)

1615
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,000
 That chunk, 'cause like, I basically made

1616
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,800
 my two big piles of firewood that I always make,

1617
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,880
 and then I made two more big piles of firewood

1618
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,200
 in front of that.

1619
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,980
 And I was like, as soon as we burn this ancillary pile,

1620
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:31,280
 we're going to get enough to make another ancillary pile.

1621
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,220
 - The only thing you should have done

1622
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,080
 is gotten out chat GPT and be like,

1623
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,760
 chat GPT, how much wood will fit in here?

1624
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,180
 And then like, put it in his face.

1625
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,160
 Like, no, I did my research.

1626
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,120
 I did my research.

1627
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,340
 This wood should fit.

1628
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,280
 - It'll be fine.

1629
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,840
 No, we're stacking it wrong.

1630
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,940
 We're the problem.

1631
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:52,080
 You and I are equally the problem here, sir.

1632
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,680
 Equally.

1633
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,080
 - So you load it from his truck to your truck at your house?

1634
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,000
 - No, no, his truck into the house.

1635
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,120
 My truck was not involved.

1636
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:01,960
 - Got it, I got it.

1637
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,840
 Okay, that's where I kept getting confused.

1638
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,680
 - Okay.

1639
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,500
 - Yeah, we were loading it into like

1640
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,000
 the wood storage area in my house.

1641
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,080
 - And he was like, it's not going to fit

1642
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,380
 in that storage area.

1643
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,220
 - Yeah, yeah.

1644
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,060
 And he was like, absolutely not.

1645
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,900
 And he was just-

1646
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,740
 - And you took the rest of the wood

1647
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,400
 and built a second storage area.

1648
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,400
 You built a second, just put that wood together.

1649
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,000
 - Yep, that's right.

1650
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,940
 That's right.

1651
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,000
 - This is the, you know what this means?

1652
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,840
 You have too much wood.

1653
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,980
 We should host some kind of mini burning man.

1654
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,560
 We should build some kind of figure

1655
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,140
 that we can torch an effigy.

1656
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,680
 To celebrate something.

1657
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,360
 - I can't think of any kind of public figures

1658
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,060
 that you'd want to burn an effigy right now.

1659
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,000
 (laughing)

1660
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,400
 I don't think we have, we need to wait

1661
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,960
 for a more aggressive political climate

1662
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,800
 so we can do it.

1663
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,900
 - Just a know-it-all Norwegian is what we'd build.

1664
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,560
 We'd build a know-it-all Norwegian.

1665
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,960
 (laughing)

1666
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,800
 - God damn it.

1667
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:59,520
 Oh, fuck.

1668
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,920
 - Oh, people are asking why I didn't want

1669
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,200
 to stack it outside.

1670
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,600
 I just didn't want to.

1671
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,160
 It was going to be more of a pain.

1672
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,200
 This is easier.

1673
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,440
 - It can rain in Vegas.

1674
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,080
 - It can rain in Vegas.

1675
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,120
 Also, like I've got kind of an outdoor fire pit

1676
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,080
 and there's already a wood pile outside

1677
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,120
 that kind of runs that fire pit.

1678
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,000
 And that one's also full.

1679
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,200
 - Jacob is neat.

1680
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,680
 He doesn't want sloppy wood about his yard.

1681
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,560
 He needs things tidy.

1682
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,400
 - Yeah.

1683
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,720
 Plus this guy is like a mile down the road from me.

1684
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,120
 This was just easier.

1685
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,280
 - Yeah.

1686
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,560
 - This was just much easier.

1687
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,280
 - My new little jock versus nerd.

1688
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,640
 - As a guy who gets firewood a bag at a time

1689
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,280
 from the grocery store.

1690
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,120
 - Yep.

1691
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,360
 (laughing)

1692
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,920
 It is easier.

1693
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,760
 It is easier.

1694
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,600
 (laughing)

1695
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,440
 - It is easier.

1696
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,040
 (bell ringing)

1697
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,040
 - Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1698
01:06:51,040 --> 01:07:02,040
 ♪ Time for jock versus nerd ♪

1699
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,560
 (dramatic music)

1700
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:11,480
 ♪ Explosion of wood ♪

1701
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,760
 - We got a scooperty from the OG scoop today.

1702
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,760
 I think he said this was an AI scooperty.

1703
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,960
 So I don't know what that means,

1704
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,560
 but we'll find out together.

1705
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,480
 The categories are Matt, Paul, Jacob, and ice cream.

1706
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,760
 Paul, you're up.

1707
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,600
 - I'll try me.

1708
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,440
 - Oh, lemur screamer.

1709
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,920
 They are local trees.

1710
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,040
 Thank you for asking lemur screamer creamer.

1711
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,400
 They are indeed local trees.

1712
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,640
 It's a wood like a tree service.

1713
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,360
 This is the other half of the tree service.

1714
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,240
 So that I cut down trees in town

1715
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,040
 and around here and everything,

1716
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,120
 and then chop them up and let them sit and season

1717
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,520
 for a couple of years and then sell the firewood.

1718
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,720
 - So Andy had AI just generate all of the questions

1719
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,280
 and answers for this quiz.

1720
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,120
 - Okay.

1721
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,200
 - Oh, all right.

1722
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,040
 - This is scary.

1723
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,880
 - We'll see how this goes.

1724
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,360
 All right, I'll take me for 200.

1725
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,840
 - Let's see.

1726
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,240
 The state where Paul was born,

1727
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,560
 it's official name is a Commonwealth.

1728
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,080
 - That would be Kentucky.

1729
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,360
 - The KY itself.

1730
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,120
 - My old Kentucky home.

1731
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,880
 - Let's see, I'll try.

1732
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,680
 Well, I'll try Jacob for 200.

1733
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,760
 - I'm asking you, when you put this in AI,

1734
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,160
 did you put any facts in with it,

1735
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,320
 or did you simply want AI to use

1736
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,520
 whatever knowledge you already had of this podcast?

1737
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,760
 I'm curious about like the actual input

1738
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,800
 for this quiz. - Oh yeah, that's interesting.

1739
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

1740
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,280
 - I gave it just some like one word things,

1741
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:34,280
 like Springsteen, Louisiana, Bourbon, et cetera.

1742
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,480
 - Okay.

1743
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,400
 - Yeah, and then they kind of just went crazy

1744
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,000
 and some of the questions are really odd.

1745
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,400
 (laughing)

1746
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,680
 - I'll bet, I'll bet they are.

1747
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,280
 - All right, we'll find out together.

1748
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,120
 - Enjoy.

1749
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,320
 - Thank you.

1750
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,680
 - The only US state that is divided into parishes

1751
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,600
 instead of counties,

1752
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,040
 a legacy of its French and Spanish colonial days,

1753
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,960
 it's Jacob's home state that of course is Mississippi.

1754
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,400
 It's Louisiana, come on.

1755
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,560
 - If you read the $800 question, it's like,

1756
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,920
 Matt last sent a dick pic in this decade.

1757
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,880
 (laughing)

1758
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,240
 - I feel like we'd all get that right.

1759
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,080
 Matt, you're up.

1760
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,080
 (laughing)

1761
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,160
 - I guess we're on a roll here.

1762
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,400
 I'm gonna go with, no, you know what?

1763
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,560
 I'm gonna do Paul 400.

1764
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,960
 I'm gonna try to change the game.

1765
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,840
 - Mix it up.

1766
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,160
 Paul's favorite Star Trek series,

1767
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,840
 the one with captains, Janeway and formerly Cisco

1768
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,920
 overlapping in the same era.

1769
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,760
 - What?

1770
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,880
 (laughing)

1771
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,440
 - Nope, I'm on board.

1772
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,960
 I like this a lot.

1773
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,200
 - Oh man, I wish I knew this just 'cause it'd be funny

1774
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,920
 to take this question, but I don't.

1775
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,040
 - I don't think AI knows this.

1776
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,280
 (laughing)

1777
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,320
 - Are you passing?

1778
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,160
 What's happening?

1779
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,120
 - I'm passing, oh yeah, yeah.

1780
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,960
 - Paul.

1781
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,080
 - I mean, I guess it's next gen.

1782
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,680
 - All right.

1783
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,920
 Star Trek Deep Space Nine or Voyager.

1784
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,760
 Paul loves both.

1785
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,680
 He quotes DS9 more.

1786
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,320
 - No, that's not, that's plainly not true.

1787
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,160
 (laughing)

1788
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,880
 - Paul, you just saw it on the screen, it's very true.

1789
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,520
 - This is why we've gotta burn down

1790
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,280
 these goddamn AI power plants.

1791
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,560
 Every AI facility must be burned to the ground

1792
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,560
 because this is the kind of bullshit.

1793
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,600
 Oh my God, I know, right?

1794
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,160
 Oh, fuck, fuck.

1795
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,600
 I'll keep digging into my own grave, 600.

1796
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,280
 - For 600, the Simpsons episode where Homer goes to space,

1797
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:30,240
 Paul can quote the entire rake scene on command.

1798
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,840
 Oh God, I hope this is just an episode number.

1799
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,520
 - I know, it's gotta be Deep Space Homer.

1800
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,360
 - Oh, okay.

1801
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,200
 - But.

1802
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,040
 - That's Deep Space Homer.

1803
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,240
 - Okay.

1804
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,720
 See, now you're friends with AI again.

1805
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,560
 - Look at you go.

1806
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,400
 - No, I'm not.

1807
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,720
 (laughing)

1808
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,680
 - You love AI.

1809
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,880
 - Do you love it, huh?

1810
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,720
 - I'm not convinced.

1811
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,800
 Does the rake thing, the sideshow Bob's rakes happen

1812
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,040
 in Deep Space Homer?

1813
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,760
 - I don't know.

1814
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,200
 I'm going Paul for 800.

1815
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,440
 (laughing)

1816
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,960
 Paul's go-to improv comedy rule/theorem

1817
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,840
 that states there are no mistakes, only blank.

1818
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,760
 - Opportunities, we'll see what they say here.

1819
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,600
 Opportunities.

1820
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,640
 - Opportunities, there's happy accidents.

1821
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,160
 I mean, I'll say opportunities.

1822
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,320
 That is what he says.

1823
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,400
 - Gifts.

1824
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,640
 (laughing)

1825
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,640
 - I am so on board with this.

1826
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,600
 Matt, you're up.

1827
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,240
 - Ice cream, 200 please.

1828
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,320
 - The top selling ice cream flavor

1829
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,080
 in the United States year after year.

1830
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,080
 - Well, according to AI, it's gonna be like strained peas.

1831
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,520
 - Strained peas Neapolitan.

1832
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,720
 - Strained peas.

1833
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,200
 - I'll go with vanilla.

1834
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,160
 - That's fucking garbage.

1835
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,200
 - No, I'm sorry, it's strained peas.

1836
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,440
 (laughing)

1837
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,040
 - Holy shit.

1838
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,520
 - It is vanilla.

1839
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,360
 - Paul.

1840
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,560
 - I'll try Matt for 800, let's go crazy.

1841
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,520
 - All right, daily double.

1842
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
 - Yeah, here's where I win.

1843
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,880
 - How well do you know me, Paul?

1844
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,680
 I'll be so upset if you get this wrong.

1845
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,600
 (laughing)

1846
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,920
 - In what decade did Matt last send a dick?

1847
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,480
 (laughing)

1848
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,760
 In 2013, Matt absolutely lost his mind

1849
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,400
 watching Penn and Teller debut

1850
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,360
 their jaw-dropping new version

1851
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,960
 of this classic stage illusion,

1852
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,560
 one they had spent over a decade perfecting,

1853
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,840
 involving a live stick of dynamite

1854
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,000
 and a bullet catch gone terrifyingly real.

1855
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,760
 - What?

1856
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,680
 - This is just slop, this is just nothing.

1857
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,080
 - I mean, this is, I'm gonna say bullet catch.

1858
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,960
 - Let's try it.

1859
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,520
 It's the bullet catch, well done, Paul.

1860
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,400
 - The bullet catch is in the question,

1861
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,720
 and it's obviously wrong, there's no dynamite.

1862
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,920
 - There's no dynamite.

1863
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,680
 - Gone terrifyingly real?

1864
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,520
 - What the fuck?

1865
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,040
 - The bullet catch was definitely not debuted in 2013.

1866
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,600
 - Oh my God.

1867
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,640
 - That's great.

1868
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,480
 - Good lord.

1869
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
 - It's me, I'll try, Jacob for 800.

1870
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:03,840
 Jacob's favorite style of knife for everyday carry,

1871
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,280
 originally designed by Bob Loveless in the 1960s.

1872
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,800
 (laughing)

1873
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,040
 What?

1874
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,800
 Who is Bob Loveless?

1875
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,360
 - You know, your favorite style of knife.

1876
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,320
 - He had to be a Leatherman, right?

1877
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,960
 - Did he indeed make knives?

1878
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,120
 - Is this a Leatherman?

1879
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,400
 - No, it could be like a Leatherman,

1880
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,920
 it could be like a Switchblade.

1881
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,240
 - I bet it's a Leatherman because it's--

1882
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,080
 - It could be a--

1883
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,760
 - Well, who the fuck knows?

1884
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,520
 - Oh, no, no, 60s, I'm gonna say butterfly knife.

1885
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,840
 - Oh, there you go.

1886
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,400
 - I'm gonna go butterfly knife.

1887
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,080
 A drop point or a hunter knife.

1888
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,640
 (laughing)

1889
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,400
 - You don't even know your own favorite knife?

1890
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,240
 Come on, Jacob.

1891
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,640
 - Apparently not, apparently not.

1892
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,680
 (laughing)

1893
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,160
 - Matt! - That's a shit.

1894
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,400
 (laughing)

1895
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,280
 - Ice cream, 400.

1896
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,400
 - This ancient civilization around 2000 BC

1897
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,920
 is credited with the earliest known ice desserts

1898
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,520
 made from fruit and snow.

1899
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,600
 - The Ice Maniacs.

1900
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,920
 - The Ice, show me the Ice Maniacs.

1901
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,400
 (laughing)

1902
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,960
 - I'll pass.

1903
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,800
 - Paul.

1904
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,920
 - Pass.

1905
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,760
 - Pass.

1906
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,880
 - It's me.

1907
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:29,040
 Is it, this is the Chinese, Chinese did a lot of things.

1908
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,120
 I'll pass though.

1909
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,160
 Fuck.

1910
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,000
 (laughing)

1911
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,840
 - It was the Chinese.

1912
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,960
 - It's just the Chinese, I just,

1913
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,120
 I didn't believe in myself, everyone.

1914
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,440
 Believe in yourself, that's the message from today's show.

1915
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,680
 Paul.

1916
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,320
 - I'll take Matt for 600.

1917
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,160
 - Daily Double.

1918
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,320
 - Both the Daily Doubles.

1919
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,600
 (laughing)

1920
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,800
 - They were on the bottom two questions for Matt.

1921
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,120
 Bruce Springsteen's debut 1973 album

1922
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,400
 that gave us "Blinded by the Light" and "Spirit in the Night".

1923
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,560
 - Oh, Jesus.

1924
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,960
 Was this--

1925
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,680
 - Unfortunately, Paul, unlike the last question,

1926
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,600
 the answer's not in the question.

1927
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,000
 - No, it's not, okay.

1928
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,360
 I was gonna go with Bruce Springsteen, but--

1929
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,560
 - No, no.

1930
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,360
 Paul, if I was to say hello to you, that's a form of--

1931
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,360
 - Greeting.

1932
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,200
 - Uh-huh.

1933
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,960
 - Greetings from--

1934
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,040
 - Yes.

1935
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:24,880
 - Yep.

1936
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,880
 - New Jersey City, where he famously started his career.

1937
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,720
 - Oh.

1938
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,920
 - This could be the tripping spot.

1939
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,480
 - Asbury Park?

1940
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,320
 - Oh!

1941
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,480
 Is that the album it's called?

1942
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,240
 - Greetings from Asbury Park?

1943
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,960
 - Greetings from, I'm sorry, Paul,

1944
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,400
 it's Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

1945
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,880
 Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

1946
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,520
 I'm sorry you got that incorrect.

1947
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,360
 - Paul's.

1948
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,000
 - I'm sorry, Paul.

1949
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 - Oh, boy.

1950
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,680
 - It's me, I'll try ice cream for 800.

1951
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,840
 - Oh, you really dinged him on New Jersey?

1952
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,720
 - He didn't get New Jersey, the AI said it was wrong.

1953
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,760
 - Was it, is it just Greetings from Asbury Park

1954
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,080
 or is it Asbury Park, New Jersey?

1955
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,920
 - It is Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

1956
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,920
 - Oh, okay.

1957
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,160
 - But everyone calls it, everyone calls it

1958
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,280
 the Greetings from Asbury Park or Greetings for short.

1959
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,200
 While we're here, famously, is because Springsteen,

1960
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,880
 his whole band left after the riots

1961
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,080
 and went and started making money

1962
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,040
 with Southside Johnny in North Carolina.

1963
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,880
 So Springsteen started making money

1964
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,360
 doing to the New York Village and doing the Dylan route.

1965
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,920
 They wanted to be the next Dylan,

1966
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,520
 but he got his band back together for it

1967
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,360
 and they were still pressuring him

1968
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,840
 to be like a New York Village musician.

1969
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,760
 So he insisted the title of the first album

1970
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,080
 be called Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey

1971
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,920
 as a fuck you to the record company.

1972
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,760
 - Okay.

1973
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,120
 - Oh, I like that.

1974
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,720
 - Yeah.

1975
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,200
 - I also like that Southside Johnny got a little-

1976
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,400
 - Anytime we can bring in Southside Johnny, you know,

1977
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,040
 we are the number, we are by far

1978
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,640
 the number one Southside Johnny podcast.

1979
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,080
 - Easily, easily the number one Southside Johnny.

1980
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,160
 - And we can probably easily get him for next to confess.

1981
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,640
 So those things are also true.

1982
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,200
 (laughing)

1983
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,040
 - I don't know.

1984
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,840
 - I mean, honestly, the fact that we haven't called him up

1985
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,600
 for a churn out at a tyrannies.

1986
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,440
 - That's the move.

1987
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,040
 - He might've just been downstairs

1988
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,160
 for one of the turnouts.

1989
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,600
 - You'd packed the whole place.

1990
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,440
 - Oh, absolutely.

1991
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,520
 - He might've been there anyway.

1992
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,600
 (laughing)

1993
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,800
 The record holding number of scoops balanced

1994
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,680
 on a single cone Guinness of 2023 within five.

1995
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,920
 (laughing)

1996
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:36,320
 37.

1997
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,160
 - Good guess.

1998
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,920
 - 125.

1999
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,440
 - It's my left nut.

2000
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,280
 What are these?

2001
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,200
 Just like little pancakes of fucking ice cream.

2002
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,840
 - Little pancake ice cream.

2003
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,680
 - Bullshit.

2004
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,680
 - Matt.

2005
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,160
 - Let's do Jacob.

2006
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,000
 - Don't worry, Matt, there aren't any Daily Doubles left.

2007
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,040
 - Jacob 600.

2008
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,920
 - The NFL team, Jacob bleeds black and gold for.

2009
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,640
 Their home dome is now called the Caesar Superdome.

2010
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,920
 - That would be the Falcons, the Atlanta Falcons.

2011
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,640
 - Of course, the Falcons.

2012
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,480
 - The Saints.

2013
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,600
 I'm sorry, Matt, that's the New Orleans Saints.

2014
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,480
 The New Orleans Saints is actually the correct answer.

2015
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,320
 - You are taking me on that.

2016
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,160
 - Paul.

2017
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,400
 (laughing)

2018
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:28,560
 Paul, you're up.

2019
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,240
 - You are ruthless today, Jacob, ruthless.

2020
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,320
 - I'm sorry, Matt, it's the AI.

2021
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,720
 It's not me, it's the AI.

2022
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,320
 - I'll do Matt for 400.

2023
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,120
 - Matt's home state, whose nickname is the Garden State,

2024
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,400
 despite what you might think from the turnpike.

2025
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,560
 - New Jersey.

2026
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,120
 - Wow.

2027
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,880
 - I'm sorry, it's brand New Jersey.

2028
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,920
 - Sparkling New Jersey, still has that New Jersey smell.

2029
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,320
 It's me, I'll try ice cream, 600.

2030
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,000
 The ice cream chain founded in Burlington, Vermont in 1978,

2031
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,920
 whose flavors include cherry Garcia and fish food.

2032
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,640
 It's fish with a pH, fish.

2033
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,120
 I believe that would be Ben and/or Jerry's.

2034
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:12,960
 Ben and Jerry's.

2035
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,800
 - Ben and Jerry's.

2036
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,920
 - Ben and Jerry's.

2037
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,960
 - I'm sorry, there's no end or there.

2038
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,800
 (laughing)

2039
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,080
 - No or, it's just an end.

2040
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,640
 Matt, you got Matt or Jacob?

2041
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,000
 - I guess I'll go with Jacob for it,

2042
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,400
 or just so I can break even.

2043
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,880
 - The brand of bourbon Jacob keeps on his bar cart

2044
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,400
 that's distilled in Kentucky,

2045
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,920
 but named after a Louisiana parish.

2046
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,760
 - What?

2047
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,760
 - Do you know the answer to this, Jacob?

2048
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,960
 - I don't own a bar cart.

2049
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,400
 - Is there an answer to this?

2050
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,920
 (laughing)

2051
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,200
 I don't even have a bar cart.

2052
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,680
 - I can't even think of a parish name to name.

2053
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,920
 - I mean, there's like Orleans, Treme, Rapids.

2054
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,760
 - I'll pass.

2055
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,600
 - Paul.

2056
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,080
 - This has to be a Kentucky.

2057
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:15,080
 - Or it'd be a bourbon with a Louisiana name?

2058
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:15,920
 - Yeah, pass.

2059
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,160
 - A Louisiana parish name?

2060
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:22,360
 Yeah, I have no idea, pass.

2061
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:28,160
 Oh, Jefferson's Ocean, or Jefferson's.

2062
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,600
 - Yeah, but you wouldn't have gotten Jefferson's.

2063
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,800
 I probably could have come up with Jefferson's,

2064
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,880
 but I wouldn't have come up with Jefferson's Ocean.

2065
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,600
 - Yeah, Jefferson's has other, not Ocean,

2066
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,840
 but they've got other Jefferson's, yeah, yeah.

2067
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,240
 I do have some Jefferson's in the bar.

2068
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,480
 - Cart? - Well, there you go.

2069
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,200
 - I don't have a bar cart, I just have a bar.

2070
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,080
 - We gotta build you a bar cart before next time.

2071
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,880
 - I do need a bar cart.

2072
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,400
 Paul closing out the category and the game, Matt, for 200.

2073
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,920
 This duo has performed together at the Rio All-Suite Hotel

2074
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,680
 and Casino in Las Vegas since 2001.

2075
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,840
 - Penn and Teller.

2076
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,440
 - Ziegfried and Roy.

2077
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,760
 - Ziegfried and Roy, Penn and Teller.

2078
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,840
 I really like that Ben and Jerry's,

2079
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,160
 the answer for Ben and Jerry's earlier

2080
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,200
 had the ampersand in it, but the Penn and Teller answer

2081
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,560
 has the word and spelled out.

2082
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,360
 - Good old AI coming through.

2083
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,640
 - Yeah, that's right.

2084
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,520
 That is the game, Paul wins with 600

2085
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,480
 because he loves AI the most.

2086
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,880
 Matt's in second with negative 400,

2087
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,960
 and I'm in third with negative 1600.

2088
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,960
 That's from OG Scoop, thank you, OG Scoop.

2089
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,320
 - OG, yes, thank you.

2090
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,040
 - That AI Scoop, and he worked out just fine.

2091
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,560
 - OG, I'll say this is a fine experiment.

2092
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,560
 I don't know if it's worth replicating.

2093
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,400
 - We don't do it all the time.

2094
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,600
 - No, let's not do it anymore.

2095
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,800
 Let's leave AI alone.

2096
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,360
 Let's stop fucking with AI.

2097
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,160
 Hey, Matt, how is Penn doing, by the way?

2098
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,320
 He hurt his ankle, yeah?

2099
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,720
 - He did, he broke his ankle.

2100
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,720
 He had to cancel all the shows this weekend,

2101
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,960
 and then of course he canceled the podcast,

2102
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,160
 so I only know from a couple of text exchanges

2103
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,120
 that he's doing okay, he's on the mend.

2104
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:06,120
 - I remember distinctly, it really hit me again yesterday

2105
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,040
 when I read this news and they had to cancel shows.

2106
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:15,040
 I remember distinctly on, I believe it was March 12th

2107
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:20,200
 of 2020, right before the shit hit the fan,

2108
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,360
 and I was talking with one of the bartenders at Absinthe,

2109
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,880
 and we were talking, 'cause there were rumors of things

2110
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,280
 having to go on pause for a moment.

2111
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,720
 We didn't know what was up, and I said,

2112
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,320
 "Well, I'll tell you this.

2113
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,480
 "I just found out that Penn and Teller

2114
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,760
 "have put their shows on hiatus,

2115
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,360
 "and there has to be some real shit for that to happen,

2116
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,480
 "so I think things are coming down."

2117
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,800
 And sure enough, the next day and a half later, kaboom.

2118
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,640
 - Yeah.

2119
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,480
 - They were a little bit ahead of the curve.

2120
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,040
 - But it all turned out to be fine.

2121
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,760
 Paul, as usual, was incorrect about that.

2122
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,160
 - Everything's just been up, up, up, up, up since then.

2123
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:00,980
 - That's right.

2124
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:05,120
 - Turned down, it was a hoax, and we're not still doing--

2125
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,080
 - Me and my negative Nancy thinking.

2126
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,640
 Well, I mean, I am a little concerned

2127
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,180
 that I could explode at any minute,

2128
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:15,080
 having had many vaccines and updates, but whatever.

2129
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,700
 - But the government's following your every move now

2130
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,160
 that it has, you know, Microsoft--

2131
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,760
 - That's true, I do have lots of tracers in here.

2132
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,380
 I'm basically a walking air tag, so.

2133
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,960
 (laughing)

2134
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,560
 - I've said that about you for years.

2135
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,820
 (laughing)

2136
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,800
 - Oh, we're getting a shout out here.

2137
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,000
 Hey, Paul, Nick's son is playing basketball

2138
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,480
 at Madison County tonight.

2139
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,080
 Go Eagles, beat the Indians, let's go.

2140
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,760
 - Go for it, yeah, beat the Indians.

2141
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,400
 Of course they're still the Indians.

2142
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,520
 We're not gonna change that.

2143
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,240
 (laughing)

2144
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,520
 Of course my fucking alma mater, Madison Central Indians,

2145
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,920
 are still the Indians.

2146
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,460
 Good lord.

2147
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,600
 I will say, it did give me that one wonderful moment

2148
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,400
 when, and John has told the story before, I think too,

2149
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,600
 but you know, I was able to, during a homecoming parade,

2150
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,160
 the Latin club, I chained up my brother

2151
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:10,140
 to a giant papier-mache rock.

2152
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,600
 And, 'cause we were the Latin club and we did the myth of,

2153
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,720
 who is it that brought fire to the--

2154
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,200
 - Yeah, yeah. - Prometheus?

2155
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,040
 Prometheus. - That's it.

2156
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,040
 - So, and he was cursed to have a vulture pick his liver out,

2157
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,140
 or an eagle eat his liver every night.

2158
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:31,080
 So, we dressed John up as the opposing team,

2159
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,460
 chained to a rock. (laughing)

2160
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:37,880
 And us, with a hatchet, like an Indian hatchet,

2161
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,760
 chopping his liver while he was chained to a rock.

2162
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,280
 - Oh my god. - It was,

2163
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,440
 I got to drive my brother getting his liver chopped

2164
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,920
 (laughing)

2165
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,440
 by another football player.

2166
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:56,800
 Down the main street of Madison County, Richmond, Kentucky,

2167
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,440
 that was a fuckin' highlight.

2168
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,840
 - Yeah, John says he's not show business.

2169
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,980
 That's a starring role.

2170
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:05,360
 That goes on the resume.

2171
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,800
 That better be on his resume somewhere.

2172
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,940
 - It should be, yeah.

2173
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,280
 Opposing team Prometheus.

2174
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,320
 (laughing)

2175
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,400
 - I have another list here,

2176
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,580
 another modest list here, Jacob, are we?

2177
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:21,040
 - We're figuring out what's going on with the list thing.

2178
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,200
 But yeah, we're gonna keep on thankin' people.

2179
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,520
 - All right, well, I wanna thank-

2180
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,720
 - We're getting to the bottom of everything.

2181
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,000
 - I wanna thank Ben Jaffer for creating this podcast.

2182
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:28,840
 - Thanks, Ben.

2183
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,660
 Get well soon.

2184
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,720
 - I wanna thank Elaine Hayhurst and Katie Hurd

2185
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,920
 for stopping by to talk about the Sharples parody musical.

2186
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,720
 - Fantastic to have them there.

2187
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,900
 I do, I love it when we do stay nice and contemporary

2188
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,200
 with Vegas Entertainment News.

2189
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,460

 And I wanna thank the following people

2191

 through the town to create the Prometheus myth

2193
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,720

 We sure do appreciate you.

2228
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,360
 - We do. - Mestrangelo.

2229
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,600
 We should've switched lists, Jacob.

2230
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,440
 I had that one down.

2231
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,260
 - We should have.

2232
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,880
 Mestrangelo, that's it.

2233
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,960
 I hear these names and know them,

2234
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,080
 but then you see them and you just have no idea.

2235
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,280
 - You're on the spot, you're on the spot.

2236
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,760
 All eyes are on you with these thank you lists.

2237
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,720
 - This is the Wednesday episode, yeah?

2238
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,460
 So this goes out Thursday, is that right?

2239
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:04,300
 Or Wednesday? - Correct.

2240
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,120
 - That's right.

2241
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,480
 - All right, so I wanna give a heads up to scoops.

2242
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,520
 We're aiming for a Friday night Zoom hang.

2243
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,540
 9.30 EST, my time.

2244
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,580
 So it'll be 7.30 on the West Coast,

2245
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,520
 but then we'll go for a couple hours

2246
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,040
 of playing some games and hanging out and chatting.

2247
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,860
 I'll get the-- - You said that'll be

2248
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,560
 Friday, Paul? - That'll be Friday night.

2249
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,080
 - Friday, January 23rd.

2250
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:27,920
 - That is correct.

2251
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,000
 Friday, January 23rd, this coming week.

2252
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
 And I will send out the invites through Patreon shortly

2253
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,760
 after our second recording here

2254
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,820
 and try and get that all squared away.

2255
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,520
 Leon is coming aboard, thank you, Leon,

2256
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,560
 to help lead us through some games.

2257
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,080
 It's gonna be a real fun night.

2258
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,940
 Yeah, we're all gonna have a good time.

2259
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:49,160
 These hangouts have been exceptionally fun,

2260
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,540
 so I'm looking forward to it.

2261
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:54,740
 And please hop on board and join us on Friday night.

2262
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,260
 And I don't have to, I'm on vacation right now,

2263
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:58,360
 so I don't have to work.

2264
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,260
 I don't have to worry about getting up early.

2265
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:03,200
 So I'll be well rested and feeling bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

2266
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,160
 Who knows, I might go for a while playing games, who knows?

2267
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,840
 And hopefully Matt and Jacob can drop by

2268
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,200
 at some point in the evening, even just to say hi.

2269
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,360
 - Yeah! - When is it?

2270
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:18,640
 - It's gonna be Friday night, 730, your time starting.

2271
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:23,480

2273
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:25,920
 - Yeah.

2274
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,040
 - Oh yeah, that's why we're doing a double today,

2275
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,680
 is 'cause Matt can't do it on Friday.

2276
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,200
 - Yeah, so January 23rd, I'm in Lexington.

 Then off to Chicago, and January 27th,

01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,840

2287
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,320
 Myself and my friend Sarah are gonna be teaching

2288
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,480
 my free improv workshop that night.

2289
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,320
 - Oh nice!

2290
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,800
 - And I've already put the stuff up

2291
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,180
 on Scoop Group and whatnot.

2292
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,720
 Appreciate everybody retweeting and sending out the word

2293
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,880
 to people you might know if you're in the area,

2294
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,840
 or you might even find yourself traveling to the area.

2295
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,760
 It's out there near Pittsburgh in,

2296
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,680
 oh, what's the place called?

2297
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,980
 I can't remember the name of the crazy little town.

2298
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:23,120
 But yeah, look it up online, it's right there.

2299
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,240
 It's on Scoop Group and whatnot, but it's free class.

2300
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:30,040
 Two hours of fun with me and Sarah teaching some improv.

2301
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,720
 Come check us out, hang out, come see me.

2302
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,040
 It'll be great times.

2303
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,560
 - Remember, there are no bad things that happen in improv,

2304
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,640
 only gifts.

2305
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,880
 (laughing)

2306
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,120
 - Thanks for listening everybody.

2307
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,800
 Stay safe out there and we'll see you soon.

2308
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,500
 - We'll see you soon.

2309
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,080
 (upbeat music)

2310
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:54,920
 - I am hoping the weather holds

2311
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,360
 for these next couple of weeks.

2312
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,120
 It's gonna be kinda crazy out here.

2313
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,700
 (upbeat music)

2314
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,620
 (upbeat music)

2315
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:14,580
 - Come on, yeah.

2316
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,920
 - See ya!

2317
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,880
 - Trenum, that's the town.

2318
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,720
 - Trenum.
