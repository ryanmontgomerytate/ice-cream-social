1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Hey Sal.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Hank, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 We haven't worked a case in years.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I just bought my car at Carvana, and it was so easy.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Too easy.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Think something's up?

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 You tell me.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 They got thousands of options.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Found a great car at a great price.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And it got delivered the next day.

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 It sounds like Carvana just makes it easy to buy your car, Hank.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Yeah, you're right.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Case closed.

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000

 I want to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,240
 Oh, those are the folks that deliver that frickin' ice cream straight to your frickin'

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
 ear holes.

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,960
 We're not getting demonetized yet.

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
 Right.

 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,440
 Yeah, I'd love to.

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 Great, let's go.

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
 Ah.

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
 Oh man.

44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 Before we start the show today, I want to say that my wife is a beautiful and intelligent

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
 person.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
 Okay.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,200
 A round of applause for my wife.

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
 Yes.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
 We must have really messed up.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
 It's time for Matt Maddowin's ice cream social.

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
 Sitting in Texas, that's Matt Donnelly.

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul Maddowin.

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the audio guy.

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
 We're preachingfun.

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 We're preachingfun.

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
 That's right.

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:31,920
 I'm in San Antonio, which of course is French for the red stick.

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 Yes.

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
 Very excited to be here.

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,600
 I'm in the west side of Pittsburgh, which is French for Aaron Rodgers can suck my balls.

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,120
 By the time this comes out, we'll know.

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,920
 I'm telling you, the truth will be out.

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,760
 Are you expecting a Rodgers Renaissance, Matt Donnelly?

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
 Here's the thing.

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
 One, he's old and the only person who's been able to play old is Tom Brady, and no one

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
 else has been able to play old.

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,560
 But, you know, Saquon Barkley came back from an Achilles injury last year for the Giants,

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,000
 struggled, then got traded to the Eagles and became an MVP candidate, offensive player

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
 of the year and Super Bowl champion.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,460
 Most people are better their second year back from an Achilles injury.

71
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,160
 So if Rodgers is going to be healthy, last year's not a sign of what he's going to play.

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
 Yeah.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
 Yeah.

74
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
 Do you think he's got something to prove?

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
 No.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,560
 I just think out of sheer karma, like we live in the most annoying timeline and the most

77
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,400
 annoying timeline thing to happen would be Aaron Rodgers, Aaron Rodgers Renaissance would

78
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 absolutely be.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,760
 Oh my God, Jacob, I forgot to talk to my mic for the whole first, okay, now I have my mic

80
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
 up to my thing.

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
 That's going to sound fantastic.

82
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
 I will, I will patch something together between the recording, the zoom too.

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,160
 I'll patch something together between your mic and the zoom.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,800
 I'll sweeten it up, Donnelly.

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,920
 There goes all the trends we were going to hit on social media.

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
 No the most annoying thing that I agree with you completely that Aaron Rodgers having it

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
 being the comeback player of the year this year just goes along in line perfectly.

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
 Yeah.

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,960
 I wish him no ill will, but I hope he snaps like a twig on the first play.

90
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,880
 I mean, his other Achilles does have the opportunity to do something really funny right now.

91
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
 It's true.

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,640
 Come on Achilles, do it.

93
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,400
 So I went and got, I went to get into the truck last night to go to work.

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,360
 SJ had left for the, for the week, he's out of town until Sunday night.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,040
 And so I went and got in the truck last night to go to work, got in, hit the little, it

96
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,200
 has a push button start, hit the push button start and nothing happened.

97
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,560
 Oh no.

98
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,000
 Nothing happened at all.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,760
 Yeah, like, uh, the, uh, like the lights didn't come on, no clicking, nothing.

100
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
 Just just dead.

101
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 DED dead.

102
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,360
 Now this is your gas vehicle.

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
 This is the gas truck.

104
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 Yeah.

105
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
 Is it all gas?

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
 It is all gas.

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:18,440
 No, some of its metal, I mean some breaks, some metal, some oil, gas, no breaks.

108
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,860
 So I got in and it was dead.

109
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,440
 So I had to Uber to work and then Uber home from work last night and then had to get up

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
 early today because SJ's out of town.

111
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,080
 She has the, she has the car.

112
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
 Yeah.

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 So I can't, I can't jump the truck.

114
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,860
 I don't have another car to jump the truck off of.

115
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,520
 And so I, uh, I call roadside service.

116
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
 I call Dodge roadside service.

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,160
 They very sweetly came out, uh, this morning, uh, however, very early after getting out

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 of a show at midnight.

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
 Boy, does that early morning come early.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
 That is tough.

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
 Yes.

122
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,240
 And, uh, so, uh, he gets here, he puts the, the jump back on there.

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
 I say, I don't know what happened.

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,760
 Uh, the truck's pretty new.

125
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
 Uh, it shouldn't be having any battery issues, but, uh, who knows?

126
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
 Let's see.

127
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,060
 So he puts the jump back on instantly.

128
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,360
 Everything comes on everything.

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
 Everything turns right on.

130
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,040
 Truck powers right up because yeah, the battery was dead, but I can't tell if it's charging

131
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 or not.

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,360
 Uh, it looks like it is though.

133
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,960
 And, uh, but he had another call to run to, so, and you said, can you, before you go,

134
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,080
 put those on my nipples and give one more, one more go.

135
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 Yeah.

136
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
 One more.

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
 One more.

138
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 Just hit the button.

139
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
 Clear.

140
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 Don't look at me.

141
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 Okay.

142
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 Look at me.

143
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
 Clean up my pants.

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 I'm a AAA member.

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,720
 I said, clean up my pants.

146
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,160
 I need roadside assistance.

147
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,600
 Come on.

148
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
 I'm quadruple A. I have four A's.

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
 Fourth A stands for?

150
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,680
 You know what, the final A is in the back seat, brother.

151
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
 Yes, sir.

152
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,360
 Go ahead and find the A. Oh, you had to come out and say it.

153
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,840
 I was trying to be all coy.

154
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
 Nope.

155
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
 Not me.

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
 Anal.

157
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
 A stands for anal.

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
 What does the other A stand for?

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
 I thought it was all supposed to be anal.

160
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
 Yeah, yeah.

161
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
 It is.

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
 It's anal, anal, anal, anal, anal.

163
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
 If you have four A's.

164
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,200
 That was five A's.

165
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
 What company are you working with?

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
 Oh, shoot.

167
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 I've exposed the fifth A.

168
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 They're going to kick me out.

169
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 Only the secret fifth A?

170
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 The quintuple A!

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,640
 Jacob, you have to edit this out or they'll kick me out.

172
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,160
 Quick, don't talk into your microphone again.

173
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,920
 It's actually, they wrote the theme song to the second level of Super Mario Brothers.

174
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,040
 It goes, anal, anal, anal, anal, anal, anal.

175
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
 Oh, my gosh.

176
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 That's the secret lyrics.

177
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
 That's only the triple A.

178
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 Yeah.

179
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 Secret lyrics.

180
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,400
 Well, Jacob, I don't want to step on your story here.

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,160
 One of those pipes goes right to the five A meeting.

182
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,600
 I don't want to step on your story here, Jacob, but I have a sneaking feeling that since the

183
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,200
 technician had to go away quickly and wasn't sure that the battery was charging, I have

184
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,560
 a sneaking feeling all did not go to plan.

185
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
 No, no, no.

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,660
 After that, everything is fine.

187
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,520
 Everything is currently peachy keen.

188
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
 Really?

189
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
 Battery charged up.

190
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,240
 I took it down to AutoZone and they put the tester on it and checked it over real good

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,840
 and they said it was all good.

192
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
 Getting the zone.

193
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,840
 The weird thing though, AutoZone, anal, anal, anal, AutoZone.

194
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,040
 Hey, remember when AutoZone used to be called AutoShack and RadioShack sued them?

195
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
 Yes.

196
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
 No.

197
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
 It made them change the name to AutoZone.

198
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
 Who's laughing now?

199
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,680
 Who's laughing now, RadioShack?

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
 Exactly.

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
 They were called AutoShack, huh?

202
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
 Yeah.

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,160
 When you were a kid, it was AutoShack.

204
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,680
 When we were kids, it was AutoShack.

205
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,880
 I guess we didn't have any AutoShacks in Kentucky.

206
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
 Getting the shack.

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
 AutoShack.

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
 AutoShack.

209
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,000
 The difference.

210
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,240
 The weird thing though was when he put the jump pack on the truck, everything turned

211
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,880
 on.

212
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,280
 I watched nobody in the Zoom laughed but Paul on that one, which is fine by me, but the

213
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,960
 fact that I got Paul is good.

214
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,560
 I had just taken a drink too.

215
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,720
 It was dangerous.

216
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,240
 No, the weird thing was everything though was turned off.

217
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,440
 So like the radio was turned all the way down and turned off.

218
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,240
 All of the climate control systems, all the air conditioners and everything was all turned

219
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,320
 off and the doors were unlocked, but everything was like folded up and like the mirrors were

220
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
 folded up and everything like it does when it locks.

221
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,040
 So what we figured out was the new Dodge, and I bet other new cars have this too, has

222
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,800
 like a power save mode.

223
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,160
 So if it is getting down to almost dead, it'll start turning off auxiliary systems to try

224
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
 to save the battery.

225
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,400
 So it turns down the radio, turns off the radio, turns off the climate systems, unlocks

226
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,680
 the doors just so you don't get locked in or locked out or whatever.

227
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:08,320
 It's like a Starfleet starship that diverts all power to life support.

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
 That's it, just bare life support.

229
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,540
 And so what we figured out was right before she left town, SJ had unloaded a whole bunch

230
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,120
 of stuff from the truck and she had, when she went to turn off the truck, we think she

231
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,520
 might have double clicked the button or something and just turned all the auxiliary stuff back

232
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,920
 on after turning the motor off and just left it running.

233
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,480
 Wait, is it a keyless car?

234
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
 Yes.

235
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
 Got it.

236
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,520
 And so I think she turned the auxiliary stuff on, left everything running.

237
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,240
 It looks like it ran for about nine hours.

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
 Yeah.

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
 Wow.

240
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,280
 The battery held out for a really long time.

241
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
 That's pretty good.

242
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,680
 Can that be good for your battery to run dry like that?

243
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,200
 If you just woke up early, Jacob, you'd be fine.

244
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
 You know, if you just woke up a little earlier.

245
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,060
 Oh, motherfucker, I did today.

246
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,120
 Usually I'm up for like 45 minutes before we start recording.

247
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,840
 I've been up for three and a half hours today.

248
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
 Oh, buddy.

249
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
 I feel you.

250
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
 In San Antonio every day.

251
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,080
 And I just walk like a different direction, see if I can discover, basically I'm going

252
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,360
 to discover a place for coffee and a place for breakfast tacos.

253
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 I just have to go whichever direction I'm pleased to find a new place.

254
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
 Right.

255
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,520
 And I saw the sign for coffee and I went inside and it's actually like this lush lobby of

256
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,560
 a hotel on this beautiful coffee station that was there.

257
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,640
 And then on the menu is clearly like put together by like a true coffee enthusiast, all kinds

258
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,000
 of different drinks and syrups and that I don't normally see.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Dirty sodas.

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,320
 Basically, a lot for dirty sodas and the really nice espresso cappuccino machine, you know,

261
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,440
 those real real deal machines, a lot of Starbucks push button one.

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:00,400
 And asked the lady if I could have, you know, an Americano and a point of one of the syrups

263
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,680
 and she goes, I, yeah, yeah, you want like a big cup, I was like, yep, that size is good.

264
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,960
 And then I was like, pastries here, what are these, what are these things in the middle?

265
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,600
 She's like, I, I think they're danishes.

266
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
 Okay.

267
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,200
 Was this like her first hour on shift?

268
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,400
 I go, I, I didn't want to say it, but I go, I also think they're danishes.

269
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:28,800
 I just don't know what kind, like, oh, you and I both recognize the circular shape, but

270
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,360
 I was curious to the contain what they contain.

271
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,920
 I concur, doctor.

272
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
 Those are danishes.

273
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,200
 She's a cheese.

274
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,880
 I think cream cheese danish, I think stepped on cheese danish.

275
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,640
 That's super, that's a classic, that's okay.

276
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,200
 Let's give one of those a whirl then, you know, and, uh, so to see that up, she's making

277
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 my drink.

278
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 She's pouring espresso over ice into my little thing.

279
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,720
 And then I see her like almost look over her shoulder at me and then she just pulls out

280
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,960
 like a bottle of water and pours a bottle of water into my thing for the water, for

281
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
 the espresso.

282
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,580
 I'm fine with using bottled water for my water, for my, uh, but, uh, curious that this very

283
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:14,560
 fine station doesn't have working plumbing, um, and so, and she goes, it's, it's, it's

284
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
 bottled water.

285
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
 She was like, it's, it's good water.

286
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 I was like, no, no, it's good.

287
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 Go, go help yourself.

288
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 Go for it.

289
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
 I'm happy.

290
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 Everything's fine.

291
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,800
 And then I said brown sugar, cinnamon brown sugar was the name of one syrup.

292
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 I was like, yes, let's do a couple of pumps of that.

293
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,280
 Two pumps, please.

294
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,720
 And uh, she's looking around and she's like turning around every bottle and she's like,

295
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,400
 I found a sugar free one.

296
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,720
 I was like, don't, don't worry about it.

297
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
 Just I bet.

298
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 Yeah.

299
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 I bet you have vanilla.

300
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
 Yeah.

301
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 Give me two pumps of vanilla.

302
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
 I bet you know right where that one is, right?

303
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 She goes, are you sure?

304
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
 Cause I have the sugar free brown sugar cinnamon here.

305
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,560
 No, no, no, no.

306
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,360
 Um, uh, did you find out if this was like somebody's kid or something?

307
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,080
 Was it, was it take your kid to work day?

308
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
 What's that?

309
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,640
 She actually was using, uh, the kidnapped hand gesture and I missed it.

310
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,680
 She kept asking you if you wanted an angel shot.

311
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
 It's quite possible.

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,240
 There was a robber underneath the counter with a gun pointed to her the whole time.

313
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
 You just weren't being nice.

314
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:32,920
 You want sugar free, I think I have some more pumping syrup with the brown sugar under the

315
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
 counter.

316
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:43,640
 If you just look under the counter, if you take these out without paying for them, they

317
00:14:43,640 --> 00:15:02,360
 sometimes trigger a silent alarm at gun point that I have to come out now.

318
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
 I'm sorry.

319
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
 I'm sorry.

320
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
 Everybody.

321
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 I have a gun.

322
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,720
 That makes a lot more sense.

323
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,600
 The only thing I said, the only thing I told this young lady was please don't tell this

324
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,120
 guy that I'm under here and that's the one thing you did.

325
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
 Did I say it?

326
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
 I didn't mean to.

327
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
 I tell you what.

328
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
 You strongly implied it.

329
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
 I couldn't, I just couldn't take it.

330
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,520
 Mr. Robber, Mr. Robber, I believe in second chances.

331
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,440
 I have to go record a podcast anyway.

332
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,000
 I'm going to leave and then you guys just start from one, you know, start from scratch.

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 No, no, no.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You, you go ahead.

335
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,840
 I don't even want to rob this place anymore.

336
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,360
 I'm, this is really just taking all this steam out of my sails.

337
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:48,200
 The reformed Robber from San Antonio presented to you PBS through selective partners like

338
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,440
 the Helena Rubinstein Foundation.

339
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,400
 It's such a good feeling to know you're alive because I left you living, though I was robbing

340
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,440
 you inside and I said, you know, not today.

341
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,760
 I will not shoot you then run away.

342
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,520
 It's a good feeling, a very good feeling, a feeling you know that I'll be back to get

343
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,600
 my fucking money, bitch, and if you don't have it, this trigger is going to itch and

344
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,760
 it's going to go off and blow your head away.

345
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,060
 I promise you, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mr. Robber's neighborhood.

346
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,960
 We're happy to see him.

347
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,560
 He's just changed out of his sneaky clothes.

348
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:38,800
 Wherever he goes, near or far, I still don't know what danishes are.

349
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 What did you eat?

350
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 A pastry?

351
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,680
 So she goes to get the French vanilla syrup, right?

352
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
 Oh, yeah.

353
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,440
 Here's the thing, baristas, you sheer up things, you got to wipe or what if you have like the

354
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,760
 removable spouts, you wash the spouts, right?

355
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
 Right.

356
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,780
 If it's the pumps, you still have to at least take like a warm cloth at the end of the shift

357
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,920
 or the beginning of the shift to make sure you wipe those puppies down.

358
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
 Right.

359
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
 Yeah.

360
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
 Wipe them puppies.

361
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
 Mm hmm.

362
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
 No.

363
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
 Hadn't been done.

364
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 She goes to squirt the vanilla syrup.

365
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
 Oh, God.

366
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
 You saw the glomp?

367
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
 Just jizzes right in her own face.

368
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
 Oh.

369
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
 Just absolutely explodes in her own face.

370
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 Oh, shoot.

371
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
 Like a joke.

372
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
 Oh, she's having a terrible day.

373
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,160
 Like a joke at a naked gun, she just assaults her own face with vanilla syrup.

374
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
 Oh.

375
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
 Oh, sweetie.

376
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,440
 I feel so bad for this sweet girl.

377
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,480
 She goes, I hate these things.

378
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,200
 I'm trying to make you a coffee, man.

379
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,880
 She just wants you to have some coffee in a day.

380
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
 Can I have some flavoring?

381
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 You're like.

382
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
 Yes.

383
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:44,800
 He tells me he loves me.

384
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 Just and like literally was like, oh, I hate these like literally with like syrup across

385
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
 her face goes like, I hate these things.

386
00:17:51,400 --> 00:18:00,480
 She just turns around, looks at you, Mondays, am I right?

387
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,960
 And I was like, been there, girlfriend.

388
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,520
 How do you think I got how do you think I started interning for Penn and Teller?

389
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,040
 I made them coffee.

390
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,400
 Can I tell you how I got these claw clackers?

391
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:23,880
 Let me tell you, I used to pick up pastries with my bare hands when I was first working

392
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
 here.

393
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,600
 Bear hands out of this.

394
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,280
 That was just a little too grotesque of a thing to do.

395
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,080
 So I I went ahead and got myself some tongs.

396
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,560
 And I use those to pick up the bear claws and the pastries and the Danish.

397
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,120
 And I was a fiend for the day, even though I didn't know what was in the Danish.

398
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,800
 That was part of the fun picking up the Danish that I couldn't tell what was inside.

399
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 But I went ahead and ate it anyway.

400
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:03,380
 And then I rigged all your fucking things to explode your God damn it.

401
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,920
 I was wondering where the story was going.

402
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 But now it was worth the monologue.

403
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
 It was worth the pain.

404
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,120
 They say he's a super criminal and I know the whole time I was like, this doesn't sound

405
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,840
 terribly criminal at all to me.

406
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,080
 But the ending, though, it took a turn.

407
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,800
 It's all about the way I hide the syrup sheepishly showed me this container of cinnamon.

408
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,880
 She's like, this is like cinnamon.

409
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,160
 And I go, it is cinnamon.

410
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
 It's like cinnamon.

411
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
 Yeah.

412
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
 She said it's like cinnamon.

413
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,800
 And I was like, like cinnamon.

414
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,360
 I was like, that'll be great.

415
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
 You go ahead and you go and clean your face.

416
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,280
 I'll throw some cinnamon in here myself.

417
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 I got it.

418
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,800
 I got this.

419
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,920
 I don't believe that I can in good conscience ask you to do anything else for me.

420
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,400
 I'm going to see myself out.

421
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
 Please have a better day.

422
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,360
 I don't want to leave this establishment with you having 10 drink additives splattered all

423
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,840
 over you because of my order.

424
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,520
 I can't take that on my conscience.

425
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,240
 No, this is just outrageous.

426
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
 Then she leapt onto the wall and stuck to it.

427
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
 Just boop.

428
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,400
 You know who else thinks the walls when they jump at them?

429
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
 The following sponsor.

430
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,880
 Today's show, Mad and Mally's Ice Cream Social.

431
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,280
 First of all, shout out to Froyo who wrote why is so syrupy in the chat.

432
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,000
 Today's show is brought to you by Vacation Packages for Nerds.

433
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,080
 That's from Big Ben in 2021.

434
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,440
 That's Vacation Packages for Nerds.

435
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
 Hello there.

436
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,960
 I know you're all dying to go on some kind of a trip or a journey or a jaunt of some

437
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,640
 sort and maybe go onto a balloon or a flying device.

438
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,880
 What I'm offering is a trip that you can take with your loved one or your sibling or what

439
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
 have you.

440
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,000
 You can go to a place where they will love you and take you and embrace you.

441
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,240
 This is Nerd Vacations brought to you by nerds who know the way to do it.

442
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,120
 Of course, Nerd Vacations are all at home.

443
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
 That's exactly what we're doing.

444
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,800
 We're going to be at home and we're going to play Magic the Gathering.

445
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 That's it.

446
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,360
 Magic the Gathering, of course, everyone knows is a vacation unto itself, taking you to the

447
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:24,960
 many varied lands all across Innistrad and Phyrexia and all places in between.

448
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,400
 You can only imagine the kinds of locales you will find yourself in when you are mid-battle

449
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
 with your cardboard warriors.

450
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,400
 Go ahead and place them onto the forefront and see how much mana you can deal damage

451
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,040
 to your opponent with.

452
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,560
 While you're there, just imagine yourself in the fields of Ravnica, floating away on

453
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,680
 an island on all your own.

454
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:58,280
 That's my idea of a really great vacation, or hey, how about this for a nerd vacation?

455
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:05,720
 Why don't we plug in the old game system and let's go to a place we all know and love,

456
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 Vice City.

457
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,280
 Yes, let's all go to Vice City for a vacation where the toots are plentiful and they can

458
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,360
 be beaten for the money you give them after you do it.

459
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,840
 This sounds like a trap.

460
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 This is definitely a trap.

461
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,320
 I'm not saying that Grand Theft Auto, the video game, is any kind of secret government

462
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,760
 sci-op, but I'm certainly not implying that the new Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to actually

463
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,040
 literally entrap people into the virtual game world where they will be unable to escape,

464
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,240
 where they will be actually shackled to the game for many, many hours of their day, playing

465
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,720
 it to earn real-world money only to just spend that on food and water delivered to their

466
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,280
 home because they can't leave because they have to keep playing the game because they're

467
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,640
 going to be the game.

468
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,280
 Oh, so it's not going to be that?

469
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,480
 You say it's not going to be that, though?

470
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
 No way.

471
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:17,560
 No way are we going to be utilizing actual in-live players replacing NPCs.

472
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,440
 That would be uncatchable.

473
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
 No way.

474
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
 Good.

475
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
 As long as you're not going to do that, I'm fine with it.

476
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
 Signed off.

477
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
 Don't trust it.

478
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
 You tricked us, you super nerd.

479
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
 You tricked us.

480
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 Good.

481
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
 Ha-ha.

482
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
 Ha-ha.

483
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,760
 Take a vacation, bitch.

484
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,880
 So I was doing-

485
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 Fair enough.

486
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 Tough but fair.

487
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,520
 I ended up, you know, I put myself on all these different websites trying to increase

488
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,120
 my corporate work for magic.

489
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,400
 Oh, did we ever get resolution on your Bachelorette gig?

490
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
 Did that happen?

491
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
 They canceled.

492
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
 I was going to do it and they canceled that.

493
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 Well, there's the resolution.

494
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,040
 They called off the wedding.

495
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,040
 They put up a picture like, "This is who I'm going to bring in front of us at 10 o'clock

496
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
 at night in this private suite."

497
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
 And they say-

498
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,480
 Do you have a cancellation fee?

499
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
 Yeah.

500
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 Nice.

501
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 So you made a little money.

502
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,280
 Yeah, so I'm joining all of these sites to figure out my best practices, and why I went

503
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,440
 through with this Bachelorette party was to make sure I could create a performance agreement,

504
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,720
 Chad GBT, and basically ask my friends for best practices and just go, "Yeah, I'm sorry

505
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,680
 I'm not going to hire an entertainment lawyer for my $300 gig for Bachelorette party."

506
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,600
 I get you on that one, but still, the AI zombies are coming for us all.

507
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,960
 Oh, they are.

508
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
 That's true.

509
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
 I'm terrified.

510
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
 That is true.

511
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
 I don't disagree.

512
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:54,840
 So same, on a different website, I ended up just agreeing to do a birthday party in Redlands,

513
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,960
 California, about three hours away from us.

514
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,400
 Same thing, I was just going back and forth with the person, so I ended up agreeing to

515
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
 do it.

516
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 All right.

517
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:12,560
 And so I drive out last Saturday to a party in the Redlands, California, and a beautiful

518
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,240
 backyard for someone's birthday.

519
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
 And I'm doing a rope trick, right?

520
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,920
 And I say I have a magic wand and it's a giant bowie knife, it's a 10-inch bowie knife, make

521
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,000
 jokes about a game through TSA, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

522
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,920
 And I always hand it to someone and say, "Do you believe in the power of this magic wand?"

523
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,600
 And then I have them turn two pieces of rope back into one pieces of rope, mirror, right?

524
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,780
 And I get up this person who's honestly, I believe, presenting mail.

525
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:58,800
 So I watch my pronouns and they also seem to be with someone who also seems gender fluid

526
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,480
 in the back.

527
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:09,140
 And so I hand this person the knife and say, "Do you believe in the power of a magic wand?"

528
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:15,480
 And she quietly dead eyes me and says, "I believe in the power of our Lord and Savior,

529
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 Jesus Christ."

530
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
 Oh, boy.

531
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 Oh, boy.

532
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
 Oh, boy.

533
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 Oh, boy.

534
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
 Oh, boy.

535
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
 Oh, boy.

536
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
 Oh, boy.

537
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
 Oh, boy.

538
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 I'll see your ridiculousness and I'll raise you.

539
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
 At the throne.

540
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 That's right.

541
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:36,720
 I want to say, you know, it's funny about knowing how magic tricks work.

542
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,000
 I know how con artists work and I want to be like, you are surrounding yourself with

543
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 self-hatred.

544
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Do you understand?

545
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,320
 There's a place where you are free to be whoever you want and that answer is anywhere but a

546
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
 church community.

547
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 Isn't that sad though, Matt?

548
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,640
 I want to give you a hug and take you out and say, "Let's just go.

549
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
 Let's just go.

550
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
 Have a nice life."

551
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
 Get in the car.

552
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
 Get in the car.

553
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,880
 That's a big part of the whole religious thing.

554
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,800
 The self-hating thing is a real deal.

555
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
 It's legit.

556
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 I mean, I can't...

557
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,240
 You and your partner, you guys help me load out and I'll take you to the gayest area of

558
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
 South Las Vegas.

559
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
 Yeah.

560
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,200
 We'll go get you fixed up.

561
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,460
 Yeah, yeah.

562
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,400
 This is going to be the best night of all of our lives and let's fucking go.

563
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,280
 I promise you will see Jesus in the back of the Piranha Club.

564
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
 Yeah.

565
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,960
 He dances in there.

566
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
 Yeah, yeah.

567
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,960
 His name is Jesus and he will blow your mind.

568
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,140
 And other things.

569
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,540
 I basically said, "Fair.

570
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:50,680
 Do you feel like helping me with this little magic trick?"

571
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 Sure.

572
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,080
 I'd love to not have that conversation right now.

573
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,320
 Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

574
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
 Were they the celebrants?

575
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
 This is my second routine.

576
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
 Who were they?

577
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,600
 I have like seven more to go.

578
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,940
 Who were they in regards to the party?

579
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:14,540
 Friends of, just friends, had to be friends of either the children of the person, or celebrating

580
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
 someone's 70th birthday.

581
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,480
 So they were an outside irritant.

582
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
 Yes.

583
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,180
 Got you.

585
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:28,800
 And then I go further in the show and I'm doing my unarmed chop routine and I get the

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,920
 person up and I go, "Who are you?"

587
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,120
 And the man I go, "And you know everybody here?"

588
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,320
 He goes, "I'm his daughter."

589
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,840
 Like there's like a weird awkwardness of like, "I'm his daughter."

590
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
 Okay.

591
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,320
 And she's a nurse that gave plenty of good humor to the arm chop routine.

592
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,780
 And then later on I get the couple, right?

593
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,960
 The wife hired me for the 70th birthday party and so I'm going to do the wedding ring routine

594
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,120
 with them, celebrate the birthday guy and his wife.

595
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,280
 And I go, "How long have you guys been together?"

596
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,400
 And they're like, "10 years."

597
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,200
 And I was like, "Oh, now I know the awkwardness of the daughter thing."

598
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
 Yeah.

599
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,280
 Got it.

600
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,640
 This is daddy picked up a new piece of ass here.

601
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 Yeah.

602
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,160
 And daughter might not be incredibly thrilled about it.

603
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,720
 This is hotter wife number two is here.

604
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
 Yeah.

605
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,800
 Or could it be the other way around?

606
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,120
 Could it be dad is new dad?

607
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,640
 Or did she look just like her dad?

608
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,560
 She was not old enough to be the mom of the...

609
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,240
 She didn't say, "I'm Amanda's mom," or anything like that.

610
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
 Oh.

611
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
 Yeah.

612
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
 Yeah.

613
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,720
 Did she have a beard that gave away like she had the same facial hair as the dad?

614
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,120
 That's it.

615
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
 Yeah.

616
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
 Yeah.

617
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
 Yeah.

618
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
 Okay.

619
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 Yeah.

620
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
 That's a key indicator.

621
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,840
 I mean, I guess, Paul, since you're really holding me to the coals here, I don't know.

622
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
 I don't know is the answer.

623
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
 Wait a minute.

624
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
 Wait a minute, Paul.

625
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,880
 The last time I saw a birthday magician, all he did was ask inappropriate questions about

626
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
 family lineage.

627
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 That's right.

628
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
 This is like...

629
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
 And his name was Piff the Magic Dragon.

630
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,860
 That is true.

631
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,960
 If you put on a dragon suit, you can get away with more.

632
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
 That's true.

633
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,840
 One of the reason I ended up following through with it, I said, "Have you ever hired entertainers

634
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,340
 before?"

635
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,440
 And she said, "I have.

636
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
 We hired a comedian.

637
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
 It was not a good experience."

638
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
 Oh, dear.

639
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,240
 And I go like, "Oh, gosh," and making me ensnare myself into saying like, "Well, I can make

640
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,920
 up for that guy," kind of thing.

641
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,880
 This is before you started your show as you were meeting them?

642
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 This is the booking.

643
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
 Yeah, the booking.

644
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 Oh, okay.

645
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
 So this is...

646
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
 Well, that's good.

647
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,320
 But you didn't just show up at their doorstep and go, "Hey, you ever hire anybody to do

648
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,000
 stuff like this before?"

649
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,280
 And was it okay?

650
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,480
 And were they wearing pants?

651
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
 Because I'm not.

652
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
 It was not happening here.

653
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
 No.

654
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
 No.

655
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 No.

656
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
 No.

657
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
 No.

658
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
 No.

659
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
 No.

660
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
 No.

661
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
 No.

662
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
 No.

663
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
 No.

664
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 No.

665
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
 No.

666
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
 No.

667
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
 No.

668
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
 No.

669
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
 No.

670
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
 No.

671
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
 No.

672
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
 No.

673
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
 No.

674
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
 No.

675
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
 No.

676
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
 No.

677
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
 Oh, the downtown breeze is a-blowing nice and free.

678
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
 Did you find out who the comedian was?

679
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,560
 From Jersey thrust a bowing knife at me, I think I'd believe in Jesus too.

680
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
 Fair enough.

681
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
 Fair.

682
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 Fair enough.

683
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
 Fair.

684
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,120
 No, I did not ask who the comedian was because there's no good...

685
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,000
 Either I don't know them or I do.

686
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And that's terrible.

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Or you do.

688
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Yeah.

689
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I don't...

690
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And then I have to...

691
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 What am I going to do?

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Call that person up?

693
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Be like...

694
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Absolutely.

695
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 "Jason, you suck, buddy."

696
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Yeah.

697
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 No.

698
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 No.

699
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 No upside, I don't think, to knowing who it was.

700
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 And it's out in California.

701
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Exactly what I wanted to know.

702
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 So I imagine it's some guy from LA is actually what I think.

703
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Oh, okay.

704
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Yeah.

705
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
 But yeah.

706
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:59,840
 So because of the reputation of a party magician, I was absolutely trying not to ask any questions.

707
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,400
 I tried so hard to not clarify anything.

708
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
 Just like, "Great.

709
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 Moving on."

710
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,400
 So, do you have any kids?

711
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
 You do.

712
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
 Any that live?

713
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
 All right.

714
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
 All right.

715
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
 Could you bring them out?

716
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,400
 Could you leave me alone with them for a while?

717
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,840
 I have some magic I'd like to show them.

718
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
 Marry for 10.

719
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
 Well, then who's her mom?

720
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
 Wait a minute.

721
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
 Is she here?

722
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
 This doesn't track.

723
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
 Get everybody up here.

724
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,320
 Everyone who's been married to my friend, get up here.

725
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 Everybody.

726
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
 All the wives.

727
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
 Get them up here.

728
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 Any miscarriages in the audience?

729
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
 Hands up.

730
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,160
 That's always a good ice breaker.

731
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
 Anybody have a child?

732
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
 Die young?

733
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
 Anybody?

734
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
 Take it from this magician.

735
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,160
 "Pregnancy is tricky."

736
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,040
 Oh, boy.

737
00:32:51,040 --> 00:33:01,440
 Look in my hat.

738
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,680
 Appropriate party magician is a pretty good bit, though.

739
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,840
 If you look in my hat, I've got my own form of IVF.

740
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:16,560
 I vanish flowers.

741
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
 You can actually use that one, Matt.

742
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
 Yeah, Matt, you can use that one.

743
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
 Hold on.

744
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
 Let me get out a pen.

745
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
 A pen with invisible ink.

746
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
 Don't worry.

747
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
 Matt, don't worry.

748
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
 We're recording this.

749
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
 Oh, good.

750
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
 Yeah.

751
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
 Just send me on our edit.

752
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
 I'll add to my notes.

753
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
 IVF.

754
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
 I vanish flowers.

755
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
 Gold.

756
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
 Gold.

757
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:39,680
 This is under the gold column of my notes.

758
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,680
 This is the best.

759
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,520
 Under the "put it in tonight" column.

760
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
 So funny.

761
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 Let's see.

762
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,800
 Oh, ultrasound.

763
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,120
 That's the noise that I associate with applause.

764
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
 That's my ultrasound.

765
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
 Applause.

766
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:11,120
 How about you guys give me some ultrasound right now?

767
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:18,400
 Oh, wait a minute.

768
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:27,680
 This party has been catered, and that means just like IVF, they're going to feed us.

769
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:33,320
 It's a catered party.

770
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,600
 It's a catered party, so they're going to feed us.

771
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:45,680
 Matt, timeout involves there might be a timeout later.

772
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,800
 All right.

773
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,120
 You don't want Paul to just keep on whispering to him.

774
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
 Let's see.

775
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,400
 Not about penises, no.

776
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,960
 This is a long way to go here, but let's see.

777
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
 Okay.

778
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:07,880
 So I'm going to start my own television mystery series, and I'm going to employ a famous TV

779
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 author who's going to help.

780
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:18,240
 He's written tons of screenplays, and he's going to help me with getting this new project

781
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
 born.

782
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
 Huh?

783
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
 Oh, no.

784
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,600
 His name is Steven J. Berthknell.

785
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,520
 Yeah.

786
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
 So what else happened?

787
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
 That's a long way to go for that one.

788
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
 That was a real long way to go for that one.

789
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,920
 I actually just thought you were going to make a way worse joke, and I'm just glad you didn't.

790
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,300
 That's all I care about.

791
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,600
 What TV producer were you thinking of?

792
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
 Roger Still?

793
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:57,400
 Okay, so I don't want that to go out to people.

794
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,520
 Claire abortion.

795
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:08,760
 I'll tell you, one of the coolest things that happened out here is for the second time,

796
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,440
 Tim Jenison has left his ranch to come out and have a meal with me.

797
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,240
 Oh, that's so nice.

798
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
 Great.

799
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
 Get out of here.

800
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
 Where'd you guys leave?

801
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,840
 I'm really going to miss this podcast.

802
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
 Where'd you go?

803
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,520
 So he picked me up and he says, have you ever been to Rudy's?

804
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,120
 And I said, no, he goes, Rudy's is a very famous barbecue place.

805
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,200
 I'm going to take you to the original location.

806
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,160
 And so we go about 25 minutes out of town, and it lives up to the hype.

807
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,360
 It is attached to a gas station.

808
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,560
 It is just built into the building.

809
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,920
 It is all bare bones.

810
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
 There's no air conditioning.

811
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,480
 There's just fans going on.

812
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,600
 You walk in and kind of like a cafeteria kind of lineup.

813
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,220
 You order your sides first, then your meats second, and their plates are pieces of wax

814
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
 paper.

815
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,560
 They have just the brown paper.

816
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,120
 The guy with the sides is handing out small samples of the creamed corn to let you know

817
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,360
 how today's batch tastes.

818
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,040
 Oh, wow.

819
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:22,600
 And so we're eating creamed corn and we get some briskets, some ribs, those chopped brisket

820
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,500
 and barbecue and turkey.

821
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,980
 It was crazy.

822
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,720
 And you all just sit at these like big picnic tables.

823
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,040
 You get a big bucket of soda.

824
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,640
 And I tell you, just superior to a microwave hot dog.

825
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
 Just so good.

826
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,440
 In what way?

827
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,720
 No, I agree.

828
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,840
 That's a fancy new location, Jacob.

829
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,040
 The original one is literally just attached to a gas station.

830
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,280
 Like you see gas pumps on the side.

831
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
 I can send a picture too.

832
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
 Oh, yeah, sure.

833
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
 Yeah.

834
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
 Let me see if I find the original.

835
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,040
 I love me some good burn ends.

836
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
 Oh, yeah.

837
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
 Yeah, yeah.

838
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,780
 And you know when you go into those places, you just see like the plywood walls, people

839
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,840
 putting food onto a basket with some paper on it.

840
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,860
 You know it's going to be the best thing ever.

841
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,360
 We did style switch the last time I was in Austin with my brother and I got their burn

842
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
 ends.

843
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,400
 And it's just really well done pork belly.

844
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,000
 It was just I've regretted ordering the brisket.

845
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,160
 I was like I should have just doubled up on the burn ends because it was so fucking good.

846
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,320
 Like perfection.

847
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
 Yeah.

848
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:42,560
 And then in line, he's talking about how rough to get ourselves a sausage, you know, Texas

849
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,120
 barbecue place are always known for sausage, we'll get half a link.

850
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,520
 And I go, oh, that's good.

851
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
 I can't wait to have a barbecue.

852
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,520
 When I go, my podcast partner, he grosses me out.

853
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,520
 He likes a microwave hot dog.

854
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,880
 And Tim jenison says heats it up just fine.

855
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,120
 Yes, I am in good company with super genius Tim jenison.

856
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,220
 And then I said, he also does it with with bratwurst.

857
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,880
 And Tim goes, Oh, no, no, no, that's terrible.

858
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,880
 You got to grill a bratwurst.

859
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,280
 Not an Aldi brat.

860
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,120
 It barely counts as a bratwurst.

861
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
 Agree.

862
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
 You're right.

863
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
 You're right.

864
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,080
 I believe Aldi brat is disqualified from the conversation.

865
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
 You and I both agree there.

866
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
 No problem.

867
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
 Yeah.

868
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
 Yeah.

869
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
 It is bratwurst asterisks.

870
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
 You know what?

871
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,120
 I'll take I'll take half support for my preposterous dining habits.

872
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
 That makes me happy.

873
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,920
 You know who else is happy to take half support and half support only?

874
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,760
 And that is the following sponsor.

875
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:56,480
 Today's show is brought to you by Sweet Relief, 24 hour hotel and spa where you can always

876
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
 come in us.

877
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
 Oh, God.

878
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,820
 Jacques Scoop toe from 2024.

879
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,400
 That's Jacques Scoop toe 2024 for Sweet Relief, 24 hour hotel and spa.

880
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:18,440
 Hello, my name is Mr. Bill Stevens.

881
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,120
 And I run this hotel called Sweet Relief.

882
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:34,880
 It was built by my father, Jerry Stevens, here in our house.

883
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:43,360
 You can come to my house built by Jerry Stevens and you can have a sweet relief.

884
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,720
 That's right.

885
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:55,360
 The secret of our spa slash hotel is that every piece of art is fuckable.

886
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
 That's right.

887
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
 All right.

888
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
 We have made.

889
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 Yes.

890
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
 Art.

891
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
 OK.

892
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,240
 We have waist level paintings throughout the hotel.

893
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,320
 So you don't even take it off the wall.

894
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
 No, no.

895
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:17,080
 They're there, they're all of all of our paintings are equipped with glory holes.

896
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:25,360
 They are all glory hole paintings and they are all themed.

897
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
 Now here is the trick.

898
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
 I'm sorry.

899
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
 I'm sorry.

900
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
 Before we.

901
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
 Here we go.

902
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
 Here we go.

903
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
 We continue this negotiation.

904
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
 Always with the questions.

905
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
 Huh?

906
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,460
 Are you are you French?

907
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,460
 What do you mean?

908
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,620
 I'm just curious about your accents.

909
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,240
 My father's name was Jerry Stevens.

910
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,160
 I am Bill Stevens.

911
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,900
 Does that sound French to you?

912
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
 It does not, sir.

913
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
 It does not.

914
00:41:53,900 --> 00:42:02,440
 OK, then I would not think that that needs any more explanation.

915
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,760
 You know, I hear you saying that.

916
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,640
 But I I'm very curious about this accent, sir.

917
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:19,320
 And listen, here's the thing about about the about where are we going?

918
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,880
 This is the thing about my place, OK?

919
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,240
 All of the artwork he's got is on a waist level.

920
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,040
 And it's all got holes in it where there's mouths or butts.

921
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,600
 And that's what you can insert your stuff in.

922
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,760
 Now, I have not let out the ladies either.

923
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,780
 I have not forgot about the ladies.

924
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
 What?

925
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,800
 I have not forgot about the ladies.

926
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,640
 No, I mean, I'm curious.

927
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
 Huh?

928
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
 I heard you.

929
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
 I'm curious.

930
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,240
 Well, how you plan to help the ladies?

931
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,200
 Oh, the lamps.

932
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,040
 Enter a scoops of check.

933
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:06,660
 Those are choking hazards or you don't put them in your mouth.

934
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,920
 I mean, you can.

935
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,920
 You can.

936
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
 All right.

937
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,440
 You can do anything you want that sweet relief.

938
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,960
 I don't care.

939
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,640
 My whole house, because it's my house and it's filled with the calm of a thousand strangers.

940
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:29,000
 I don't I can't get I can't access the back of the paintings.

941
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,840
 They're built into the walls.

942
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
 I did it.

943
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
 I did it.

944
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
 plan ahead.

945
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:44,160
 Which this is illegal to let you know that my home reeks of takeover.

946
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,840
 My home reeks of bleach and sour apples.

947
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,320
 It's just a bad scene.

948
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,040
 It's I the walls weep.

949
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,440
 You understand me?

950
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,360
 I have to take a moist towel to most of the walls every morning to take away some of the

951
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:09,520
 seepage and it doesn't stop and keep seeping.

952
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,440
 There's a girl who works at a coffee shop who's looking to get extra work.

953
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,360
 Do you think you can help her out?

954
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:22,120
 Oh, I love a barista bring her over.

955
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,920
 You should use socks says chaotic and too late.

956
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,040
 I've it's in the drywall.

957
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,360
 I really should just replace the drywall.

958
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,240
 Look, my only good thing is that it's at waist level.

959
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,800
 So at some point I could cut it all away and put like, you know, what do they call that

960
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
 design?

961
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,100
 What do they call the waist level beams when they go on?

962
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,920
 You know, at this point in the bit, you're asking for architectural specifics.

963
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
 Yes.

964
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
 Okay.

965
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
 Yeah.

966
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,160
 I think he's asking for a chair rail.

967
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,280
 That's exactly chair rail and runner board.

968
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
 Is that what it's called?

969
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
 Sure.

970
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
 Okay.

971
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
 Great.

972
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,080
 What funny is I want to bring up something that Tim and I talked about, but now I can't

973
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:19,560
 tell them to listen to this episode.

974
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,360
 Next episode, next episode.

975
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:27,960
 Well, I want to bring up something real quick, too late.

976
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:36,280
 Bad Pirate Scoop sent me an amazing, an amazing gift from Australia.

977
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:49,740
 He is friends with a creator called Salt, Andrew Saltmarsh, I guess is the creator's

978
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,680
 actual name.

979
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,900
 And he does this art by Salt and he made these really cool stickers and sent them to me.

980
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,140
 They're all crazy Star Trek themes.

981
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,160
 So this is a bat left in a piece of pie.

982
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:10,440
 It says a good day to pie or a good day for pie.

983
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:19,200
 This is a doctor, which I believe just says, Hey, in Klingon, like hey, what is the doctor

984
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,000
 for our audio listeners, which a doctor is a Klingon dagger.

985
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 Okay.

986
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,200
 It's a Klingon dagger with the word Hey on it.

987
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
 Yep.

988
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,560
 This is a zombie hand giving the Vulcan salute, it says live long on it, which is cool.

989
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,840
 You were just flipping off the camera.

990
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,880
 Yeah.

991
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,120
 And then this is a red shirt, what remains of a red shirt with a damaged com badge and

992
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
 blood all over it.

993
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,120
 Clearly the victim.

994
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,500
 And then I got a couple others that are beautiful stickers.

995
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
 They are.

996
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,120
 And I've already put them on a couple of them on some notebooks I have that I'm going to

997
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,440
 be using for the the upcoming improv classes that I'm about to start teaching this month,

998
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,800
 which I'm really excited about.

999
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,960
 And I just wanted to say thank you bad pirate for that gift.

1000
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,800
 And I am holding on to the letter and the envelope because it might be the last piece

1001
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,640
 of international parcel that I received for some time.

1002
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,080
 Well, there you go.

1003
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,080
 There you go.

1004
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,080
 Yeah.

1005
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,000
 Where do you where you want us to support this person?

1006
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 Yes.

1007
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,760
 I would say yeah, check out art by salt, S a L T. Andrew salt marsh is that individual.

1008
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,440
 They're an Australian.

1009
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,600
 And yeah, you can go check them out.

1010
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,640
 And yeah, that's it.

1011
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
 Okay.

1012
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,640
 All right.

1013
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,560
 It does really great work.

1014
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,040
 So I was talking to Tim, and we're getting it, you know, he's he's he's a total

1015
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,680
 like audio nerd.

1016
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
 Right.

1017
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
 Right.

1018
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,360
 And so we were talking about like the recording of sound and basically like, all right, because

1019
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,320
 he has like the Beatles microphone and stuff like that.

1020
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
 Yes.

1021
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
 Right.

1022
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
 Yeah.

1023
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
 He's got some real, real interesting shit.

1024
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
 Yeah.

1025
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,760
 And he and basically, if we just get into it, I was like, I basically was like, I was like,

1026
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,520
 I've had many people who understand audio explain to me how we actually record physical

1027
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,160
 sound into an object, which I still don't get no matter how many times people explain

1028
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,580
 to me what happens.

1029
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,280
 And he says it's even crazier than that is that it was like a French scientist, one of

1030
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,440
 the first known people to kind of figure it out.

1031
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,800
 And he was recording sound into like, you know, like, like, like cylinders.

1032
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,400
 It wasn't it wasn't quite that was like, it was a really like loose like metal material

1033
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
 like similar, I guess would be like tinfoil now, but it was kind of like a very, very

1034
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,440
 weak metal pewter pewter, right.

1035
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
 Something like that.

1036
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
 Maybe I don't have to look it up.

1037
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
 But a soft metal.

1038
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
 Yeah.

1039
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
 Yeah.

1040
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
 Yeah.

1041
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
 And that's the song was also soft metal.

1042
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
 No.

1043
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
 But yeah.

1044
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
 Good.

1045
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,440
 But the person first known recording audio is by this French scientist.

1046
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:16,160
 We've got to get a soft metal Jacob album where he just whispers, whispers Metallica.

1047
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:24,160
 Jacob soft metal quieter, quieter, softer, softer.

1048
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
 That's better.

1049
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,000
 And but it's still just full volume music.

1050
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,880
 The music is still just blasted.

1051
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,880
 Take my hand.

1052
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:44,440
 So take my speech, take my hearing, take my arms, take my legs.

1053
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:51,840
 This is not a heavy enough of a story to carry the bit, but all it gets.

1054
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,360
 But so so he said the crazy way of figuring out how to record stuff.

1055
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,560
 I haven't gotten to the punchline yet.

1056
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,600
 We've done too many bits in between.

1057
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,860
 He was the punchline.

1058
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:05,480
 The punchline is he was doing it before the phonograph.

1059
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,040
 So before we had an ability to listen to what we were recording, this guy figured out that

1060
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,040
 we could record.

1061
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
 Yes.

1062
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,320
 I have heard about I've been told several times about how we figured out how to record

1063
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,040
 sound before we learned how to play it back.

1064
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,880
 Tim couldn't believe that I found this to be hysterical.

1065
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,800
 I was like, wait, it's like everyone's singing and playing.

1066
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,840
 And then some some nerds going like, see the wrinkles?

1067
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,840
 It's here.

1068
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
 It's in here.

1069
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
 It's in here.

1070
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
 Guys.

1071
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,840
 They go.

1072
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
 Oh, OK.

1073
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
 Can we hear it?

1074
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
 No.

1075
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
 No, you can't.

1076
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,520
 We don't have that kind of technology, you fools.

1077
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,840
 Keep playing, though.

1078
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
 It's making the coolest wrinkles.

1079
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:54,520
 How long how long between learning to record and learning to playback?

1080
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,040
 I don't even know.

1081
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,160
 I don't even like they discovered because they discovered this guy's recordings later.

1082
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,560
 They didn't know at the time he had done it.

1083
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,640
 So it was like it was like seriously centuries later where they found the recordings and

1084
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,320
 then found a way to play them.

1085
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,460
 And sure enough, you heard the voice and music of like basically a popular song at the time

1086
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,760
 in France, which is baffles me.

1087
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,060
 That baffles me so much.

1088
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:21,880
 Digital sound makes so much more sense to me than than analog being recorded into a

1089
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
 piece of metal.

1090
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
 I don't know.

1091
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,360
 I can I can wrap my head around analog sound a little bit better because it is, you know,

1092
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,120
 it's just it's a needle vibrating.

1093
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:36,320
 It's the actual vibration of of stuff.

1094
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,800
 And well, I mean, it's the vibration of the needle against the groove of the record, then

1095
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:49,420
 amplified through the air, which is what's the only when you get right down to it.

1096
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,360
 If we didn't have air, we wouldn't have any of this shit.

1097
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,680
 Yeah, that is true.

1098
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
 Take that.

1099
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,120
 You people take air for granted because it's all got to go through the air and the compression

1100
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,120
 of air.

1101
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,120
 Right.

1102
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
 Yes.

1103
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,400
 I mean, I think that's what that's.

1104
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
 Yeah.

1105
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,000
 There's all kinds of crazy shit that's that above my brain, above my brain capabilities.

1106
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,700
 Like you said, vibrating air is above your brain for it to be like centuries later for

1107
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,640
 me to take a needle to it and go, oh, there it is.

1108
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,640
 And then hear it.

1109
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
 It's like, what?

1110
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,640
 Sure.

1111
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,640
 I don't know.

1112
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:28,600
 There was about a 20 year gap between it, Scott, Scott, Scott de Martinville patented

1113
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,640
 the oh, boy, I don't even know how to say what that word is.

1114
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,520
 It looks kind of like phonograph, but it is definitely not.

1115
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,520
 Phone.

1116
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:42,920
 It's pronounced autograph maybe phonograph and it could transcribe sound waves as a visual

1117
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,000
 line onto a piece of paper, but it had no mechanism for playback.

1118
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,740
 Scott intended the recordings or phono autographs for visual study rather than listening to

1119
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,740
 it.

1120
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,320
 So he was trying to invent something that could record the sound so that he could visually

1121
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,320
 study it.

1122
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,000
 And then Edison invented the phonograph about 20 years later, was it called Phono, Phono

1123
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 Autograms?

1124
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Yes.

1125
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 Phonoautograms.

1126
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,960
 Is it phonautograms or phonoautograms?

1127
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,960
 Phonoautograms.

1128
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:19,960
 Phonoautograph was the machine and phonautograms were the things that the machine made.

1129
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,880
 Phonoautogram is a wonderful Mr. Burns kind of line.

1130
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,480
 He would, he would, he would drop that.

1131
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,760
 Oh yes, Smithers, I recorded this onto the phonautogram.

1132
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,760
 Yeah, exactly.

1133
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,200
 I recall, I had a recording of this on phonautogram when I was a boy.

1134
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,600
 When I was but an adolescent.

1135
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,600
 Yes.

1136
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,960
 Uh, that means 20 years, that's like enough gap for the people to come back.

1137
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,960
 They're still living, right?

1138
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
 It's like, Hey.

1139
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
 Right.

1140
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,320
 We were really dicks to you back at that early recording party you had and sorry we haven't

1141
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,320
 spoken in two decades since we ridiculed you.

1142
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,880
 But it turns out you did record.

1143
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,320
 And I have a recording of you ridiculing me as well.

1144
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,640
 We just figured out how to listen to it.

1145
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,880
 The world's first DJ, the world's first DJ, the world's first record producer.

1146
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,040
 Because that's what, because we were talking about like basically like that you had to

1147
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,480
 play like such with such ferocity for the early, it had to be so loud.

1148
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,160
 It had to be so loud.

1149
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,720
 And then we figured it out later how to do it soft, like that's where, you know, you're

1150
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,240
 from from Bing Crosby to Sinatra to like that era of crooner.

1151
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,640
 Like we can't empathize with how much of a babymaker that was.

1152
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,360
 We cannot.

1153
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,640
 We can't go back in time to figure out that we used to have to have such loud things to

1154
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,640
 hear it.

1155
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,680
 And all the sound like this because we were kind of shouting, half shouting, half singing

1156
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,760
 me and my baby.

1157
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,880
 Yeah, and the very first time someone's like, you know, like the solitude, you're like,

1158
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,840
 oh my God, that's fuck right now.

1159
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,760
 Oh, hard.

1160
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,680
 I knocked my son into next Wednesday for Sassin' Off.

1161
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,960
 So hot, Bing.

1162
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,960
 So hot.

1163
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,960
 Oh yeah.

1164
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:14,320
 He made a wrong move at the corner of smart mouth and bullshit attitude.

1165
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:19,020
 So I had to correct that behavior.

1166
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,600
 I wonder if Bing is going to be in Hollywood Squares at Scoopfest.

1167
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
 We'll have to find out.

1168
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
 Who can say?

1169
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
 I don't know.

1170
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
 I can't wait to find out.

1171
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
 I'm really excited now.

1172
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,120
 Now, for those of you who don't know, I'm going in blind on this.

1173
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,600
 So it's going to be really, really fun.

1174
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:40,000
 I can't wait to just not know what impressions I'm supposed to do.

1175
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 By the way, Scoopfest.com.

1176
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 Go check it out.

1177
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 Yeah.

1178
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 Yeah.

1179
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,280
 End of September, end of the month, this month, come on out to Las Vegas.

1180
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,280
 It's going to be awesome.

1181
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,480
 It is.

1182
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,440
 Did you invite Tim to Scoopfest?

1183
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
 I didn't.

1184
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
 See now, Paul's dropped.

1185
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,440
 I actually sent him an email specifically.

1186
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
 No, no, no.

1187
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,120
 Paul, I know what you're going to say, but I did in fairness to Matt already send Tim

1188
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,480
 an email specifically telling him to stay the fuck away from Scoopfest.

1189
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,480
 All right, I guess we don't want him infringing on our zone.

1190
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,040
 We only have room for one hot dog microwave in this town.

1191
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,040
 That's right.

1192
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,680
 It was right after Matt told that story.

1193
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,680
 I just sent the email.

1194
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:24,080
 Fun fact, all you have to do to send Tim Jenison an email is just write Tim in the send bar

1195
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,360
 and it gets to him.

1196
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,000
 He's like Santa Claus.

1197
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,360
 Dead Lazlo might actually make it out to Scoopfest.

1198
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,820
 Do it, Dead Lazlo.

1199
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,120
 Come on.

1200
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,360
 We love last minute Scoopfest tickets.

1201
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,760
 Oh yeah, come on out.

1202
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,760
 In the meantime, we go play a little Jock vs. Nerd.

1203
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
 Oh, Schneikies.

1204
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:57,760
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1205
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:07,760
 Time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1206
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:16,120
 Hey gang, long time listener, first time caller, I made a scooperty for you using questions

1207
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:21,900
 that I pulled directly from a grade four brain quest that I picked up at a thrift store.

1208
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,360
 For those of you who aren't old, brain quest is a long skinny bundle of paper bound together

1209
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,000
 with 1500 questions and answers grouped into categories that was used to learn things in

1210
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,440
 the pre-internet era.

1211
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,440
 Hope you enjoy.

1212
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,440
 That's Johnny.

1213
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,440
 So Johnny made us a brain quest scooperty.

1214
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,920
 Did you guys have a brain quest?

1215
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,240
 Do you guys know what that is?

1216
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,240
 It sounds familiar.

1217
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:48,400
 Well, it sounds like a primarily Canadian thing since it was called grade four.

1218
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,880
 Oh no, no, I don't think it was.

1219
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,720
 Yes, look, Canadian Scoop Crystal says I remember it.

1220
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,720
 First thing up in the chat.

1221
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,360
 I'm telling you, I remember it.

1222
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,480
 Oh, I'm sure they made an American version.

1223
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
 Yeah.

1224
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
 Nope, Jacob, Paul gets full credit.

1225
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,480
 You get none.

1226
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
 Sorry, buddy.

1227
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,480
 All right.

1228
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
 Tough but fair.

1229
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,480
 What are the categories are?

1230
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,440
 Before we get into the categories, I just want to say happy birthday to Didgeridoo Scoop,

1231
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,840
 one of my best friends since his birthday.

1232
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,840
 Yeah.

1233
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,120
 Happy birthday, buddy.

1234
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,680
 Happy birthday, Didgeridoo.

1235
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:25,880
 Early days of this show, having Didgeridoo Scoop make Didgeridoo covers of famous songs.

1236
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
 God damn.

1237
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,880
 The funniest shit.

1238
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,760
 It's still one of the best things this show has ever done.

1239
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,080
 That is a truly gold bit.

1240
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,560
 That is really funny shit.

1241
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,560
 Yeah.

1242
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
 Talk about your early recordings.

1243
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:41,360
 It would literally be stuff like, whoa, living on a prayer.

1244
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,280
 So good.

1245
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
 So good.

1246
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,920
 It is right up there with dog experts.

1247
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,920
 Thank you for that.

1248
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,080
 The categories today are science, math, geography, and grab bag.

1249
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,080
 If you insist.

1250
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,080
 Grab it, Paul.

1251
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,080
 Grab it.

1252
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,080
 Oh, thank you.

1253
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
 Matt, you're up first.

1254
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
 I will take it.

1255
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:08,160
 I will take math for four hundred, please.

1256
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,960
 Which is it the better buy three shirts for nine seventy eight or three thirty five per

1257
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
 shirt?

1258
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,960
 Oh, OK.

1259
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
 OK.

1260
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,960
 OK.

1261
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,960
 Let's see here.

1262
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,520
 I have to divide seventy eight by three here.

1263
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,160
 If it goes into seven, that's two times nine.

1264
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,520
 Three shirts for nine seventy eight, please.

1265
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,560
 All right.

1266
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,960
 Three shirts for nine seventy eight.

1267
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
 Less than that.

1268
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,960
 It would be ten o five the other way around.

1269
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
 There you go.

1270
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:40,040
 Paul, that was an example of the dramatic pricing that's going to be going on as you

1271
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:46,320
 shop now at Wal-Mart is going to randomly jack up everything that you buy.

1272
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,960
 I'll go with grab bag, please.

1273
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,280
 For four hundred and the song.

1274
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,880
 What color is the Rose of Texas?

1275
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,320
 That would be yellow.

1276
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320
 Yellow.

1277
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:01,000
 And in reading the question, I almost reflexively said what color is the yellow Rose of Texas?

1278
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 Hilarious.

1279
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 It's me.

1280
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
 I'll try science.

1281
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,080
 That's actually what San Antonio stands for is yellow rose.

1282
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:18,320
 And of course, the Arapahoe legend that the flower got its color from horses peeing on

1283
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,440
 it.

1284
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,960
 That's right.

1285
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,280
 That is what puts the yellow in the yellow Rose of Texas.

1286
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,800
 The yellow Rose of Texas is colored like that because it's pay.

1287
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,800
 That's right.

1288
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,800
 That's how the song goes.

1289
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,620
 Which two planets have no moons?

1290
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,400
 I don't think Mercury Earth is one of them.

1291
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
 Earth.

1292
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
 Earth doesn't have any.

1293
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
 Our moon is a myth.

1294
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,320
 If you're flat, you can't have basically a spaceship.

1295
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,000
 Don't get twisted.

1296
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 That's right.

1297
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 Which two planets have, I think Mercury is one and let me see Venus or Venus has a moon.

1298
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,180
 My guess, Jacob, and I'm not sure, but I do recall pretty recently one of the planets

1299
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,800
 got reevaluated and basically called the moon.

1300
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:19,480
 So maybe that could work or not even called a moon called like a large body.

1301
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,920
 Yeah, it was like a large celestial body or right.

1302
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
 Yeah.

1303
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,080
 So what do you think?

1304
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:36,880
 I think it is Mercury and I think it's shit.

1305
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,120
 This is an old book.

1306
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,960
 I think it's Mercury and Neptune.

1307
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,760
 I don't know.

1308
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,760
 Wait, no, it's an old.

1309
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,320
 No, I see what you mean.

1310
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,320
 Yes, of course.

1311
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320
 It's Pluto.

1312
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,320
 It's going to be Mercury and Pluto.

1313
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,320
 Mercury and Venus.

1314
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,320
 I was wrong.

1315
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,320
 So Pluto has moons.

1316
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,320
 I don't know.

1317
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,320
 Or it was already not a planet.

1318
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:00,200
 Yeah, or it was already not a planet by then.

1319
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,200
 Well, maybe.

1320
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,600
 Matt, you're up.

1321
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,920
 I will take math for 800, please.

1322
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,080
 The sum of 16 plus five plus eight is the same as the product of four times seven, true

1323
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,080
 or false?

1324
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:24,200
 Now, let's see here, 16 plus five, that's 21 plus eight is 29 and four times seven is

1325
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,200
 28.

1326
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,200
 So it's false.

1327
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,200
 False is correct.

1328
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,400
 29 is not the same as 28.

1329
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,540
 I'm literally showing my math.

1330
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,680
 Are you smarter than a fourth grader?

1331
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,920
 I will try grab bag.

1332
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:48,140
 If you insist, here we go.

1333
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,400
 Longfellow wrote the Song of Hiawatha.

1334
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,080
 Is it a short story or a long poem?

1335
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,760
 It is a long poem.

1336
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,280
 It is a long poem.

1337
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,280
 That's me.

1338
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,280
 I'll try math for 1200.

1339
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,280
 Very well, Hiawatha.

1340
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:13,880
 How much is 3/8 of 24?

1341
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,560
 Let's see, 24 divided by eight.

1342
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,720
 Nice.

1343
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:27,760
 We're divided by, wait, how do you do that?

1344
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,120
 Multiply three times eight, Jacob, and you get it.

1345
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
 Right.

1346
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
 Oh, that's right.

1347
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,120
 Yeah.

1348
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,120
 So that would be, yeah.

1349
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,440
 So 3/8 of 24, wait.

1350
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,800
 I am just so confused right now.

1351
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,800
 I gave you bad advice.

1352
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
 I don't know why.

1353
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
 You did.

1354
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
 Where are we?

1355
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,200
 That doesn't make any sense at all.

1356
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,360
 No, divide 24 by eight.

1357
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,980
 Yes, that's what I was doing.

1358
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,680
 But then subtract two.

1359
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:02,040
 4/8 would be 12, so it'd be nine.

1360
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,160
 Yes.

1361
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,160
 Well done.

1362
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:12,080
 Boy, it is hard to do math with Paul telling me things while I'm already confused.

1363
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,080
 Matt.

1364
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,360
 I will take math for 2000.

1365
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
 Holy crap.

1366
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:23,560
 Using pencil and paper, divide $50.40 by 14.

1367
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:32,880
 Matt, do you have a pencil and paper handy?

1368
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,800
 You have a calculator, because that would work too.

1369
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
 I know.

1370
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,360
 Am I allowed to use the calculator?

1371
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,360
 Probably not.

1372
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,360
 No.

1373
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,360
 Okay.

1374
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,360
 Let's do this.

1375
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
 Okay.

1376
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,360
 So I'll try by multiplying 14.

1377
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:52,600
 So times two is 28, which means times four is 56, so somewhere between three and four.

1378
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,120
 So if I say three points something something, does that count for this?

1379
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,480
 Yeah, to get us on with the game.

1380
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
 Yeah.

1381
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
 3.6.

1382
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,480
 Okay.

1383
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,480
 There you go.

1384
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,480
 Paul.

1385
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,480
 Grab Bag, please.

1386
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,480
 For 1200.

1387
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:12,520
 Name the main villain in the series of Unfortunate Events books.

1388
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,520
 Uncle Olaf.

1389
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
 No.

1390
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,520
 Count Olaf.

1391
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,780
 Count Olaf is correct.

1392
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,520
 Saved my butt.

1393
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,520
 Is he their uncle?

1394
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,520
 I don't know.

1395
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,640
 I think he claims to be their uncle, and that's the whole thing, but yeah.

1396
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,640
 Oh, okay.

1397
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,040
 I'll try Grab Bag 2000.

1398
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,640
 What is a pistachio?

1399
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:39,120
 Oh, like is it a nut or a legume or a berry?

1400
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,120
 Is it a berry?

1401
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,120
 I bet it's a berry.

1402
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,120
 Or a flower?

1403
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,080
 I bet it's a berry, too, because it grows on trees, right?

1404
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,080
 Yeah.

1405
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,760
 So I think that means it's a berry, so I'm going to say berry.

1406
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,600
 Ah, it's a nut.

1407
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
 Boo.

1408
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,600
 Matt.

1409
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
 Ah, boo.

1410
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
 Ah, come on.

1411
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
 Oh, no.

1412
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
 Boo, guys.

1413
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
 Come on.

1414
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
 Thanks.

1415
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
 I'll go for 800.

1416
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
 Daily double.

1417
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
 Now for 3200.

1418
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
 Oh, yikes.

1419
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,320
 I was doing so well.

1420
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
 You were.

1421
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,120
 Which creates the fastest wind on Earth?

1422
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,120
 A hurricane, a cyclone, or a tornado?

1423
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,320
 Oh, this is tough.

1424
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,320
 Okay.

1425
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,160
 Tornadoes are tiny, but they're tinier, but I don't know if that means their winds are

1426
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,520
 less forceful or more forceful.

1427
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,360
 Well, I think technically a hurricane and a tornado are the same thing.

1428
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,760
 It's just that one forms over water.

1429
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
 Nope.

1430
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,920
 Cyclone and hurricane are the same thing.

1431
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,480
 A tornado and a water spout are the same thing.

1432
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,040
 Right, because a water spout is a tornado over the water.

1433
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,640
 Hurricane and cyclone are the different coasts for us, technically.

1434
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,640
 I believe so.

1435
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,640
 Right?

1436
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,000
 And it's the rotation, the way they're spinning, right?

1437
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,640
 I don't know.

1438
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,640
 I don't know.

1439
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,720
 Hurricanes in the Atlantic and cyclones are in the Pacific.

1440
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
 I think so.

1441
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,800
 That's vaguely what I know.

1442
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,040
 So if Hurricanes and Cyclones are the same thing, it has to be one thing, so I'm going

1443
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,040
 to go with tornado.

1444
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
 Ooh.

1445
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,040
 All right.

1446
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,040
 It is a tornado.

1447
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,040
 Look at you.

1448
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,040
 Look at you, with the big brain.

1449
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
 Look at the big brain on Matt.

1450
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,460
 Look at the $6,400 that Matt has now.

1451
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:16,000
 I may or may not be currently helping a fourth grader with homework all the time, so maybe

1452
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,760
 it gives me an advantage.

1453
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,760
 Hilarious.

1454
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
 Paul.

1455
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,520
 I'll try science for $1,200.

1456
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,480
 I'm the only planet that orbits the sun on its side.

1457
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,280
 Oh.

1458
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,760
 What?

1459
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,720
 What does that mean?

1460
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:47,400
 It means that other planets are not on its side, and one of them is.

1461
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,920
 Oh.

1462
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,640
 Uh, wait, what?

1463
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:58,000
 So some planets, because you have the magnetic poles, so I think that's what it's referring

1464
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 to.

1465
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,840
 Is it referring to the ax, the tilting of the planet, or is it referring to what side

1466
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,760
 of the sun it rotates around?

1467
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,560
 No, because it rotates around the sun.

1468
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,960
 It doesn't just rotate on one side.

1469
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,960
 I'll have to pass.

1470
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,960
 I have no idea.

1471
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,440
 It passes to me.

1472
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,440
 I'm pretty sure it's Uranus.

1473
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,880
 It is.

1474
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,680
 Wow.

1475
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,640
 It's just like, it's tilted way over on its axis.

1476
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,640
 Interesting.

1477
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,640
 Okay.

1478
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:30,600
 I think it's part of why Uranus has such an odd orbit.

1479
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,520
 Also, the planet goes around the sun in a weird pattern.

1480
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,520
 Okay.

1481
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,320
 Because of its rotation and tilt on its axis.

1482
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,320
 Interesting.

1483
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,320
 Okay.

1484
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,120
 Science for $2,000.

1485
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,720
 All tropical fish live in salt water, true or false?

1486
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,320
 Oh, this is a tricky.

1487
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,320
 I don't know.

1488
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,320
 False.

1489
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,080
 It is false.

1490
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,080
 Some live in freshwater.

1491
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,080
 There you go.

1492
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,080
 There you go.

1493
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:04,760
 Matt, you got geography that we have all avoided for four, eight, 12, and 2,000.

1494
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,160
 Geography for four, please.

1495
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:14,840
 Give the word for the farthest edge of a settled territory.

1496
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,840
 Over yonder.

1497
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,840
 I have no idea.

1498
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,840
 Pass.

1499
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,840
 Pass to Paul.

1500
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,840
 Border.

1501
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,840
 Oh.

1502
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,840
 Frontier.

1503
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
 Ass.

1504
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,840
 Nope.

1505
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,840
 Frontier.

1506
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
 Paul.

1507
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:35,480
 Uh, can I try the 2,000 just to try and win?

1508
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,480
 Yeah, you can.

1509
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,080
 I don't even know if I can win.

1510
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,080
 You can't.

1511
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:44,840
 What map symbol shows the location of a city that is not a capital?

1512
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,120
 Go ahead, Paul.

1513
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,880
 What map symbol?

1514
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,520
 Paul, actually, go ahead and just name a map symbol.

1515
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,520
 Dots?

1516
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,520
 Letters?

1517
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
 Mmm.

1518
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,360
 I mean, it's been a minute.

1519
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,360
 An arrow that says city?

1520
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,760
 It's been a minute since I used a map.

1521
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,760
 Mmm.

1522
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,200
 That is not a capital.

1523
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:19,960
 Oh, you remember the old bit that was in, like, every third movie where you'd have a couple

1524
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,240
 of people lost in a car somewhere and one of them would just pull out the biggest map

1525
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,240
 in the world.

1526
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
 Right.

1527
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
 It would just keep unraveling it.

1528
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,240
 It would take up the whole front seat.

1529
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,200
 Wasn't that a bit in Dumb and Dumber where they had to keep flapping open the -- or not

1530
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,200
 Dumb and Dumber.

1531
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,200
 Yeah, Dumb and Dumber.

1532
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,200
 I think it was.

1533
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,200
 I don't know.

1534
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,600
 I will have to pass because I really am at a loss.

1535
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
 That's to me.

1536
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,600
 I certainly don't know.

1537
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
 Matt?

1538
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,800
 It's not supposed to be a location of a city that is not a capital.

1539
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,680
 It's just a dot.

1540
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,680
 Microphone.

1541
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,680
 It's just a black dot, I believe.

1542
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
 I said dot.

1543
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,280
 You want to try a black dot?

1544
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,280
 Yeah.

1545
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,280
 All right.

1546
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,780
 A black dot.

1547
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,780
 Man, fuck me.

1548
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,780
 The fuck.

1549
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,780
 It's just a black dot.

1550
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,840
 That was the first thing I said.

1551
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,840
 Shit ass.

1552
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,840
 That's me.

1553
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,360
 I'll try Geography for 800.

1554
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:13,680
 Put in order from east to west, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama.

1555
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,840
 Alabama is the farthest east, then Mississippi, then Louisiana, then Texas.

1556
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,440
 Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas.

1557
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
 Well done.

1558
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,440
 Matt?

1559
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
 I'll take Geography for 1200, Jacob.

1560
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
 Oh, I don't know why I asked.

1561
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,440
 Matt, close it out the game.

1562
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,440
 Geography for 1200.

1563
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:37,360
 Which is the world's largest body of freshwater, Lake Superior or Lake Victoria?

1564
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,440
 Well, I have to guess here because I've won the game.

1565
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,440
 Yes.

1566
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,000
 Yeah, you win no matter what.

1567
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,200
 I guess although if I pass, who's the pass to?

1568
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,200
 Passes to Paul.

1569
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
 Oh, good.

1570
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,080
 Then Paul can try to beat you for second place if I pass.

1571
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,080
 Can I?

1572
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,080
 Oh, that's true.

1573
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,080
 I think, yes, you can.

1574
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,080
 I'm 800 points ahead of you, Paul.

1575
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,080
 All right.

1576
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,080
 For games.

1577
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,080
 A $1200 question.

1578
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,080
 For gamesmanship, I pass.

1579
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,080
 Paul?

1580
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,000
 I'll go Lake Victoria.

1581
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
 It's Lake Superior.

1582
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
 Of course it is.

1583
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,760
 Lake Victoria is second largest, Paul is wrong and that is the game.

1584
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,360
 Matt wins with 8400.

1585
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,040
 I am in second with 2800.

1586
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,320
 Over Paul's best efforts, he only got 800 points.

1587
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,000
 Not my best efforts.

1588
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
 And that is from Johnny.

1589
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
 Thank you, Johnny.

1590
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
 Thanks, Johnny.

1591
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,600
 If you want to send us a scooperty, send us a Price of Skrite, Jock vs. Nerd, send us

1592
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,200
 an Obelisk, Jock vs. Nerd, send us all the things over at HeyScoops.com.

1593
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,200
 Go right there.

1594
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,800
 You can send us some scoop mail over there as well, right there on the homepage.

1595
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,080
 There are links for all those things.

1596
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,280
 There's also a link right there to buy some tickets for ScoopFest.

1597
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,320
 It's gonna be awesome and you should be there.

1598
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,680
 It is going to be off the chain.

1599
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,680
 Get there, please.

1600
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,080
 We are less than three weeks away.

1601
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,080
 It's happening.

1602
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
 ScoopFest.

1603
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:53,600
 Let's do it.

1604
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,640
 Let the panic attacks ensue.

1605
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,360
 Oh, in four weeks, I'm going to be so relaxed.

1606
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,360
 Yes.

1607
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,560
 In a month, I'm just going to be so relaxed.

1608
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,560
 Exactly.

1609
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,560
 Exactly.

1610
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,240
 We'd like to thank all the people who support us over on our Patreon page.

1611
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,560
 Did you send lists or we don't have lists yet?

1612
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,800
 We don't have lists yet.

1613
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,800
 Ah.

1614
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,720
 Well, normally we'd be going to our lists here to thank the people individually who

1615
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,660
 support us at a particular level.

1616
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:20,640
 So if you haven't checked it out, go over to Preaching Fun and select a level that fits

1617
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,000
 your budget today.

1618
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:43,920
 if you like me are a little shocked that we didn't talk at all about the new Nebraska

1619
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:53,320
 re-release album that Springsteen is doing, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1620
01:13:53,320 --> 01:14:02,760
 That's fartsinabag.biz that along with PreachingFun.com takes you over to our Patreon page where for

1621
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,680
 as little as $3 a month, you can help keep this show on the air.

1622
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:11,520
 If you like what you hear, if you think it's worth more than $0, head on over to PreachingFun.com.

1623
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,320
 Head on over to fartsinabag.biz, go to either one of them or go to both of them and make

1624
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,320
 two accounts.

1625
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,800
 That'd be fine with me too.

1626
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,280
 You can do all those things.

1627
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,280
 Go over there.

1628
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,280
 Keep this show running.

1629
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,240
 It gives us money to just keep the show going.

1630
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,360
 I don't know how else to put that.

1631
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,360
 It lets us do the show.

1632
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,360
 Pay for websites.

1633
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:34,360
 I don't know, we got bills y'all, I don't know what to tell you.

1634
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,080
 We're about to pay the Orleans a lot of money.

1635
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,080
 We are.

1636
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:45,520
 Matt, the Nebraska, the new gift pack of it, it comes with a Blu-ray concert that he did

1637
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,680
 at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank.

1638
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,360
 Oh, well that's great.

1639
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
 Yeah.

1640
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,360
 I'm in.

1641
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,760
 You're going to go for the deluxe edition?

1642
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,760
 Jersey Pride.

1643
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,760
 That's right.

1644
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,760
 Yeah, I will go for the deluxe edition.

1645
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,660
 They've got a CD and a vinyl edition.

1646
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,480
 Both of them have the Blu-ray there.

1647
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,480
 All right.

1648
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,480
 Well, thanks everybody.

1649
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,480
 Stay safe out there.

1650
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,480
 We love you, and we'll see you soon.

1651
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:14,480
 We'll see you soon.

1652
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:52,100
 See what the cone, see what the cone We're Bridges, final.

1653
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,080
 Babymetal I've seen in concert several times.

1654
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,700
 They're really, really good.

1655
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,700
 Thank you.

1656
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,480
 I think we should cement, by the way.

1657
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:06,520
 See you soon and then see you at the cone to the music on the pickup is good.

1658
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,320
 I like when we do live podcasts, people just sing along and I think that's the way to do

1659
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,320
 it.

1660
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,320
 All right.

1661
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,320
 Well, we'll see.

1662
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:12,320
 Yeah.
