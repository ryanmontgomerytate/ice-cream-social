 hazel honeysuckle in the house today boldly strip.com is the website if you

 like movies and Star Trek go check it out I like two of those things I like

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,320
 Star Trek and the left one the left one only yeah this is another great reason

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,040
 for patrons to get on the ball and put in that couple bucks a month to join us

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,360
 on these live podcasts and zooms hazel is in full Trek regalia you can see her

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,720
 in her I mean it's dangerous she's in a red shirt but yeah yeah she might not

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,280
 last the whole podcast but she is and she's sitting in front of the Sun on her

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,000
 video so I mean it's it could happen any moment yeah yeah yeah have any Star Trek

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,160
 characters ever died by just being thrown into the Sun that's got to have

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,040
 happened in Star Trek right I'm sure the actual person often they do oh that's a

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,120
 good point Paul you're telling just a star plenty of people fall into stars I

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,880
 think but I don't know about our son yeah oh I mean stars are other other

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,000
 people's sons that's right let's not disparage other people's sons people

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,200
 the Sun of Vulcan one of Vulcan Suns exploded and Osmos the whole sure sure

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
 that was son of Vulcan Sun exploded and the osmosis and the whatnot then we used

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,880
 the Sun our earth Sun's gravitational forces to go back in time and save the

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,480
 whales using a Klingon bird of prey so sure for now we should we should hashtag

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,840
 for now I don't think it took I don't think it took I mean what was the last

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:16,240
 like proper Star Trek invention you attended oh god as an actual I don't know

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,080
 I mean the last time was two years ago at Rio when I was doing a fool us and

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,400
 happened to be there at the same time I didn't really get to go to the con

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,800
 proper though I got to just see people walking around and well when was the

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,520
 last time you like went out of your way and I'm gonna go to this Star Trek

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,400
 convention got yourself a ticket did the whole nine and I have never I have never

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,360
 gotten a ticket for a Star Trek convention you never enter through the

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 Stargate or wherever they walk through to go I have never gone through as a

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,560
 civilian I've always been there for work all right okay all right then what was

39
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,440
 last time you worked convention when they still had them at the Hilton so it's

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,400
 been a minute it been a minute it's been it's been probably a good solid 15 years

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,360
 since I've been in a very long time none of them have closed they're just on

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
 hiatus right how long until the Star Trek experience comes back I have no

43
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,560
 idea I have no idea well first turn back into the Hilton well here's the thing

44
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,520
 hazel is on the ground floor out there she is amongst the people's what scuttle

45
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,440
 butt have you heard about people trying to bring back the experience scuttle

46
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,680
 them butts hazel I mean there's a whole chapter new book just about scuttling

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,720
 butts the butts the butts are saying oh so much to do that oh they should bring

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,880
 about it would be great they don't they don't understand is anyone saying oh I

49
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,120
 should do that is anyone say oh I with the money that I currently have should

50
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,320
 do that oh that's a shame yeah here I am just stuffing them in my ears and

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,600
 wiping my ass with them why don't I put them towards Star Trek it'll make the

52
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,840
 same amount of what I tell you a bunch of people though we're like hey you know

53
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,640
 that you know that Empire strips back show you should do that you should do

54
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:18,600
 one of those for Star Trek oh right that's that's that's it and and how's

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,280
 that going well um I think we're gonna need another Kickstarter for that one

56
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,600
 right but I use the Empire Strips back seems to be going well right I think so

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,340
 yeah yeah it's a great show it is a great show I got to see that here in

58
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,440
 Pittsburgh oh yeah yeah it seems to punch above its weight class it seems

59
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,920
 to deliver more than what you're expecting mm-hmm oh I would agree with

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,360
 that yeah first scene they come out strong in that in the first scene of

61
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,640
 that show they come out just swinging they're real good yeah Jeff Loomis is

62
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,120
 saying that Empire Strips back touring show was close to a sellout for an

63
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,320
 entire month in Seattle oh wow so that you go on the ground reporting ticket

64
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,260
 sales we love it we love well and it's and it's it's doing decent business in

65
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,480
 Vegas it's got it's found itself a residency of sorts right oh I hope they

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,040
 did well during the Star Wars was calling me right now I'm gonna put him

67
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,600
 on speaker oh jeez oh boy the chaos yeah it seems like a lot of people were

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,760
 going to see that show well hi Brian you're an old yeah sure going

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:07:07,680
 no that's it you've reached the limit I mean by virtue of her age and race yes

70
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:23,520
 there he goes there he goes big tribal chief Brian brushwood everybody I gotta

71
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,600
 take the moral stand there Andrew heating everyone Andrew heat that was

72
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,960
 heating that was heating for sure mm-hmm so there is crossover than Hazel

73
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,280
 between the Trek and the Wars oh yeah yeah of course of course I mean I drive

74
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,120
 a stormtrooper car and I was a Klingon so it's all good yeah right but that that

75
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,560
 that hurts the idea of doing a Star Trek version of Empire Strips back you

76
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,920
 think yeah yeah it's already done you think it's cannibalizing its own

77
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,800
 audience yeah you're not gonna fly out to Vegas twice to see two different

78
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:10,280
 burlesque shows I don't know I think there is a slight possibility that you

79
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,400
 could man I really like your logic there you get the same person you could make

80
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,900
 the trek one way more tech forward I don't know I don't know you know what

81
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,400
 the key would be I'm gonna be shark tank here I'm out I'm out here's what was

82
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,360
 that if is that a foot that was coming in what in the hell was that what is

83
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,880
 that why I wanted to turn off my background why was that is that a

84
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:43,760
 Horta oh it's a dick rock oh it's a big old dick rock it's not a Horta all

85
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,040
 right but it might as well be say Horta one more time ball Horta thank you

86
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,040
 Horta got that you know the way to do it this here's the successful thing they

87
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:07,700
 just closed Muppets 3d we almost had it with Borg 4d at the experience but what

88
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,160
 they didn't do they had stuff that would move your butt in the seat they had

89
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,560
 water that would squirt in your face but they didn't have things that would

90
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,320
 attach to your junk so if you get into a theater and you get Borgified in the

91
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,040
 crotch uh-huh and the show literally fucks you while you're watching burlesque

92
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,240
 preach then you are going to go see that show a couple times probably probably

93
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,160
 we got to go back because you slept through the second half of the first time

94
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:58,280
 you gotta go back twice the smartest person handling the Star Trek IP is

95
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,680
 hazel honeysuckle that's right this person doing the smartest thing is

96
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,000
 combining her superpowers as a nerd and burlesque artist and it's true hazel

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,120
 what's your website it's boldly stripped calm boldly stripped calm and what will

98
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,560
 people find when they go to boldly stripped calm oh people will find a very

99
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:29,040
 excellent Kickstarter campaign where I'm where we are raising funds to create the

100
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,800
 second version of boldly stripped I've noticed only stripped to a bit of

101
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,640
 electric boogaloo a simplifying a bit of paring down of the options that was

102
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,720
 offered a boldly stripped one like lessons were learned I think so it's not

103
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,080
 where we can get the button put on it upside down or or to the left or to the

104
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,640
 right depending on which box you click for delivery purposes like with all

105
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,960
 kickstarters it's full of all kinds of options so that you try to keep simple

106
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,680
 you must have understood when it was the first one was so much more successful

107
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,560
 than you imagined it was going to be why did you just go right away what took

108
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,120
 you so long to come around the thing about doing version 2 I had to wait long

109
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:31,440
 enough until I forgot how much work it was that's a real thing yeah that's it

110
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,600
 that makes a lot of sense so now you just launched you've already achieved

111
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,000
 your your goal and your stretch goal yeah we made we've done three stretch

112
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,160
 goals so far and you've nailed them all and nailed them all and you're gonna add

113
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,280
 more stretch goals or you're done with stretch goals never done with stretch

114
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:03,200
 goals yet because one should be a Star Trek convention watching Paul sit

115
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,140
 through a show in his own taint tickling chairs one should be that should be one

116
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,360
 stretch call I want to know exactly what he wants attached to his junk during the

117
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,160
 show no no you would sort of device you think you want to know that but you don't

118
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,040
 I thought I wanted to do that one time I found out I didn't want to know let's

119
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,000
 just say the question implies that he's picky and he's not I'm imagining I'm

120
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,360
 imagining a Borg's head comes up out of the chair in front of you and you just

121
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,840
 take that Borg's head are you supposed to imagine the Borg says attached to a

122
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,360
 sexy body on your own or are you supposed to be picturing skull fucking a

123
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
 Borg that's what I'm the Borg's head yeah the Borg's head will be all on us a

124
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,120
 skeletal spindle like the Queen did like the you know is gesturing how the head

125
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,640
 would go towards him and Hazel yes it'll come out on a hanging spine and then and

126
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,680
 then you pick the orifice this is the thing so either you can go choose your

127
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,200
 own adventure you can go for an eye socket because it's a Borg yeah or you

128
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,520
 know if you want to get wild you can go for just a straight-up mouth or you can

129
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,320
 have it add on like it's got like a tongue attachment or something for the

130
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,800
 lady - I'm going for the ear because I wanted to hear me I want to hear me

131
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:37,800
 coming okay yeah you can go for the ear or it could be a or it could be a Borg's

132
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,280
 butt with the words ass simulate on it that could be kind of cute as simulate

133
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:55,920
 that's what it is Borg for board 5d plus ass simulation that's it simulation we

134
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,080
 got there everybody who we've arrived who's gonna work there that's what I

135
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,660
 want to know who to clean up after the audience and they all your remnants is

136
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,960
 mopper resistance is futile and your remnants are puerile that's how it's

137
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:23,440
 going space just mopper space just mopper someone's got to do it it can't

138
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,840
 be any worse than the shit that was going down during chicken jockey during

139
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:38,680
 the minecraft movie so upset about us disparaging you're right fuck plastic

140
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,400
 sci-fi things in an open theater that you're just taking random shots of the

141
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,840
 minecraft movie look this is just the next step in the popcorn buckets tell me

142
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:57,040
 I'm wrong I'm wrong that it's just one more month until a popcorn bucket fucks

143
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,960
 you they already sold a big old galactus head and he had big old ears you could

144
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,940
 hold on the dune worm no the dune worm was just a that was the shot across the

145
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,200
 bow and people did not answer the call and I'm disappointed

146
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:23,640
 was just a pocket pussy but it was also one of those like unattainable goals I

147
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,720
 mean that was it that was like a eight-inch mall you'd have to be the

148
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:35,880
 girthiest tuna can motherfucker to even experience standard for everyone does

149
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:49,080
 everyone not have see now that that's the popcorn bucket right there this is

150
00:15:49,080 --> 00:16:01,280
 how I will always picture hazel oh where do you think the butter goes that's a

151
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,880
 butter reservoir for the popcorn you need a little butter refresher just give

152
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,320
 it a squeeze just dunk it yeah hazel how many characters did you play in volume

153
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:22,280
 one we did 14 different photo shoots okay so it was 14 is it how many hard to

154
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,560
 come up with 14 more or is it easy in the Star Trek universe have 14 more

155
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,440
 different characters um I haven't decided on all of them yet because yeah

156
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,960
 you know we got we got all of the most obvious ones in the first book yeah you

157
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,160
 can revisit them right because people do multiple you know oh yeah yeah I might

158
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,560
 might redo some of them you know different situations or or eras who was

159
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,720
 your most popular what was your most popular creature from volume one oh yeah

160
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,920
 what most popular species oh the green one the Orion woman okay that's the one

161
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,320
 that everybody likes by far when you sell I mean you sell these at the

162
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:15,520
 conventions and stuff yeah yes yes at Galaxy con and do you start right do

163
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,600
 they just start thumbing through it right in front of you right there at the

164
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,520
 table did they just start going through them all well I ask people to I say look

165
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,840
 at the book then they're like oh wow look at all these girls and I say that's

166
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:45,320
 me and they're like that's you yes so way the way the opposite of what I

167
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,960
 thought where I thought it was going that's really funny Matt thought it was

168
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,880
 gonna be awkward but in the other direction yes no plenty of people make

169
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 it awkward too what's the most awkward somebody's made it um gosh I don't know

170
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,520
 like do they touch the picture in front of you do they put their finger on like

171
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,880
 a body part like some sometimes people pick up the book and look at every

172
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:22,860
 single page and then just put it down and walk away data committed to spank

173
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,000
 bank thank you recently I was at magic live and Mike gave me was selling these

174
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,240
 really awesome books one was the history of song a woman in half and the other

175
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,400
 was just a kind of like a history of magic but I knew they were like $200

176
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 books so I didn't even pretend to thumb through it I just I was I dared to read

177
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,280
 the back of one of them and then I was like I'm gonna stop touching these books

178
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:55,880
 all together cuz I'm not spending but yeah so but that guy had no problem that

179
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:03,200
 guy just thumbed right through it left his oily residue on every page this is

180
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,280
 why I have you know the table book which has been thumbed through many times

181
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,160
 have you considered have you considered going kind of a Pat the bunny route

182
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,440
 where like you have a patch of some kind of real tactile stuff in the middle of

183
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,880
 the book that continues throughout that you know I don't know what it could be

184
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,800
 Star Trek wise could be like a moon rock kind of thing or something I don't know

185
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,560
 I don't know I thought for sure you're going Merkin like a silicone that could

186
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:43,120
 be that could be yeah I'll just keeps moving towards fuckable objects the

209
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,920
 3 a.m. I'm letting my dogs out and straight out my back door up in the sky

210
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,120
 I'm seeing UFOs now I say UFO because to me they were UFOs they were

211
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,360
 unidentified unidentifiable they were flying it was a straight line of about

212
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:59,620
 five just dots of light okay and then occasionally lights were blinking in to

213
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,280
 the left and right of the column and zipping in towards the column then

214
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,720
 disappearing blink in zipping toward the column disappeared and then the column

215
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 was going up and then disappearing and then another one would start at the

216
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,520
 bottom and disappearing strange were you watching an elevator no okay but here's

217
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,480
 the fucked up thing I would say that modern life has accomplished its goal I

218
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,160
 didn't have time to just stay in there and keep watching this shit I had to go

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,600
 shoved one in your butt fuck the other two went to work I can no longer stand

221
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,000

222
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,940
 work so I'm just I feel like we're just broken it's over like I don't even know

223
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,400

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,280
 think that he's just over it I mean do you think that he's just like yeah yeah

229
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,800
 they're aliens yeah that's kind of where I'm at like it's of course there's some

230
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 weird shit going on who knows what it is but if aliens showed up tomorrow would

231
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,720
 you react with with surprise joy or or just kind of a board like of course

232
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:58,960
 you're here I'd be like hmm I'd be surprised yes I'd be surprised and I'd

233
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,040
 be like wait we didn't get ready hold on we gotta fix open up open up a flap and

234
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:14,940
 get some of this heat out of here what somebody open a flap wait we're not

235
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,960
 ready but open a flap if I saw clean up the aliens land in front of me I'd be

236
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
 like oh man this is gonna be the worst Paul is right email I've ever got on the

237
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,720
 pod oh it'd be so terrible so your first concern hazel is a tidy house when

238
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:40,560
 aliens come you know like like the like the Federation they always always wait

239
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:47,000
 till like the society is ready they have to achieve warp capability they have to

240
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,320
 achieve your capability yeah yeah but they can't join the Federation until

241
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,940
 they've like got their shit together right you know which blows my fucking

242
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,960
 mind that the earth was ever even let in like even if you look at the if you look

243
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,440
 at first contact and you're like wait a minute they came to earth they saw that

244
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,720
 from Cochrane go warp and then they went oh yeah this planet just recently got

245
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,640
 decimated by full-scale nuclear assault think they're good to go come on join us

246
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,200
 guys but then they got their shit together for like you know I don't know

247
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:29,920
 50 years or something oh boy oh boy I we were we we should never have been

248
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,400
 allowed in the UFP it's all there is to it that's it preach yeah you know me

249
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,640
 preach if I was on a walk and the aliens landed it would be so sad as I'd be

250
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,880
 concerned about my family and then I would like awkwardly not be able to run

251
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,360
 full speed back to my house like I'd have to like jog for a minute and like

252
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,280
 keep walking fast then like jog for another minute and the aliens would just

253
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,600
 be standing behind you with their arms crossed just looking at you in judgment

254
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,240
 like don't give me wrong I'm one of you making fun of Tom Cruise running in

255
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,320
 movies right like oh there he goes ha ha I mean well I can't do it I couldn't

256
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,360
 even do a Tom Cruise movie if you paid me it'd be really tough no it's to be

257
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,860
 fair though I would I'd love to give it a shot so if anybody would like to pay

258
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,840
 me Tom Cruise's going rate to make a movie I will happily attempt to make

259
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,760
 that movie absent of money I'm just doing the Tom Cruise fitness challenge

260
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,400
 and that's where I will try to become a better runner and also strap my thing

261
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,440
 strap myself onto various dangerous objects and see if I can pull off a

262
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,960
 classy stunt at my age so that's those are the two things I thought you were

263
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,280
 gonna say strap myself to various objects and fuck them like Canada RMS Nicole

264
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:55,840
 Kidman shout myself to those objects meanwhile the Penelope Cruz longing for

265
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:04,120
 a for a nice piece of cod the whole time you know what I could really go for right

266
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,440
 now some cod did this isn't that possible come out or it hasn't come out

267
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,400
 yet nobody cares that's right yeah yeah nobody cares anymore

268
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,640
 nobody gives a rat fuck that first the first one the first one that he had the

269
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,800
 audacity of that last one to be like oh it's a two-parter and it's also 18 hours

270
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,920
 long like eat my butt sir no one has time for your garbage bullshit but the

271
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,600
 end but the bad guys might get an AI thing Paul you're not totally wrapped up

272
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:41,680
 in that that apparently was the whole thing like the the the MacGuffin they

273
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,560
 were having like all these discussions about what's the MacGuffin what's the

274
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,240
 MacGuffin and Tom Chris finally like just nuclear bombs just make it nuclear

275
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,600
 bombs and that's what they did it's like bad guys have nukes good guys need to

276
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,880
 stop them done this is so dumb I don't think it was I thought it was like an AI

277
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,440
 thing like a computer that could that could control nuclear bombs oh got it

278
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,360
 okay oh that's what sunk that submarine that submarines full of nuclear bombs

279
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,560
 that's the whole beginning of the movie which is all I watched how many mission

280
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,040
 impossible movies has Tom Cruise made everybody no price is right rules just

281
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,680
 how many how many hazel's hazel's correct she just yawned while you asked

282
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,280
 that yeah yeah that's correct that's the right answer that's exactly it it's

283
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,280
 boring because it's cuz nothing's gonna happen the answer is fine the answer is

284
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,880
 eight and I had no idea you know just three you know what I think um fast and

285
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,440
 furious was benefited from the tragic passing of Paul Walker in so much as

286
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,560
 something could actually happen to a main character but I guess in the in the

287
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,320
 fictional world he's not really dead is that right are they gonna AI him back

288
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,120
 into the new movie is that what I'm hearing now I don't know wait Paul what's

289
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,480
 his name Walker Paul Walker they're gonna AI Paul Walker into a fast and

290
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,120
 furious movie I think so let's see here the new one seems like a mistake I think

291
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,240
 you're right Matt I think it's a terrible mistake and a terrible precedent to set

292
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,920
 to bring back dead people into movies yeah but if it goes I'm totally making

293
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,440
 Ben her too and I'm bringing everyone back Ben her too remember they did a

294
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,000
 Ben her remake today like who the fuck has a ball it was it was remarkably bad

295
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
 right but who even has the balls to even go you know what we should make again

296
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,720
 Ben her yeah what epic the fuck could you even add to that oh my god I love

297
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,240
 remaking things they do the upcoming the upcoming fast and furious movie the

298
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,440
 upcoming final fast and furious movie rumored to be titled fast 11 fine Jesus

299
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,360
 Christ set for release in April of 27 is planning to feature Paul Walker's

300
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,760
 character Brian O'Connor will likely use CGI and potentially AI to recreate his

301
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,300
 likeness Oh not his corpse they're not gonna string him up like a fucking puppet

302
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:26,800
 weekend at Bernie's them I'm glad they told us how it's all about family not

303
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,360
 some child he didn't know he had dressing up like him and trying to look

304
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,440
 like him in the movie because it's been that long it has been that long his his

305
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,400
 kids are alive I think he really is like supposed to be like on vacation kind of

306
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,240
 thing in the storyline he's on hiatus I don't know or maybe he's dead in the

307
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,480
 story and then they're gonna bring it back but everybody dies in that thing

308
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,320
 now too and they bring him back same thing with what's your head hey whatever

309
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,920
 Paul he's family all right and we take care of family family never dies family

310
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:02,840

311
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,920
 I'm joking motherfucker look family never dies this one literally never dies

312
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:16,400
 they could do they could do a crossover could call it Paul walking dead I've

313
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,360
 literally never been more interested in the Fast and Furious franchise I bet

314
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,720
 Kirkman could get on board he's a magician he could write some great shit

315
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,600
 for that he could make it work can owes Atlanta tax credits they help make it

316
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:37,140
 happen no Paul walking dead and any thoughts for putting video content as

317
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:44,560
 part of your attached to your your your magazine with with animated Paul Walker

318
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:58,960
 driving you around funny you say that because no except for the Paul Walker

319
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,520
 part yeah we okay so one of the shoots we're gonna do is a Ferengi mm-hmm oh

320
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:13,960
 whichever you know I know everyone was clamoring yes well the thing is tell

321
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,160
 tell everyone the thing about the Ferengi ladies the thing about the

322
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 Ferengi ladies and they're not they're not a very you know progressives progressive

323
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,600
 civilization not at all but their women their women all are just naked all the

324
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:42,360
 time and they're not allowed to do business profit which is like their

325
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,280
 their whole society is about earning profit right so the women are naked and

326
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:55,120
 they can't work and like the kinkiest thing is for women to wear clothes like

327
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,160
 them and this is this is how they they got the the main characters like the

328
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,880
 main Ferengi character to put it on would land them in jail is that what was

329
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,680
 that what happened ah it's like oh the main character like goes home and his

330
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,320
 mom's like wearing clothes and he's like oh gross gross mom and then she takes

331
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,800
 their clothes off and he puts his head in her lap oh boy it's weird no what you

332
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:31,760
 said sounds great yeah yeah so the rest of the show like this so to do a risk a

333
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,840
 Ferengi female boudoir shoot as it were yeah you're gonna have to put some stuff

334
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,520
 on she's gonna put it on yeah yeah it's gonna be the only clothes character in

335
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,880
 the entire book I mean that could be funny to have it go in reverse to start

336
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,200
 off it really would go oh it's it's definitely going in reverse completely

337
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,120
 starkers and then yeah full clothes by the end of it that's what that would be

338
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,980
 a really funny burlesque routine like a bad camp act you know where you just

339
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,280
 keep putting on clothes and so you're like giant like a snowman you know oh

340
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,760
 what was that yeah that guy wore all the t-shirts how many t-shirts did he get

341
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:18,280

368
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,080
 documentary and there is a story that Armand Shimmerman tells because he was

369
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,640
 one of the original Ferengi in deep space not or in the original or in next

370
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,240
 generation right they were originally gonna be the new big bads they were

371
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,580
 gonna be like the Klingons of next generation ah that was the start told us

372
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,160
 about this before I think I have and and there was there's a scene where they're

373
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,040
 on this planet and they've got you know the Frank you have these fucking laser

374

375
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,280
 shit yeah look out their energy whips yeah but they ended up being really

376
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,400
 goofy that's it they they they use the sonic weapon against them and the

377
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,080
 directors like oh yeah grab your heads and like writhe around in pain and Armand

378

 was like you know if we do this we're gonna look stupid as fuck and nobody's

379
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,280
 gonna think nobody's gonna think that these guys are scary at all ever again

380
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,480
 and he was dead right and they became these very clownish aliens from that

381
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,040
 point on but they wanted they wanted to set them up as like the big bad alien

382
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,680
 species for the for the whole series and that no one bought it no no one's like

383

390
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:21,680
 of course the episode that Tennessee Williams wrote for Star Trek Hazel Leon

391
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,240
 Casab just asked you about what was there a something in the first boldly stripped

392
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,600
 what what is that and is it an axiom a talaxian that's how you say that okay and

393
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,920
 is there a talaxian in the second boldly stripped and what is it not so far come

394
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,320
 on what's it so axiom it's a neelix it'd be a whole cooking scene it's a neelix

395
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:55,600
 come on Jacob it's a neelix moving on it's a neelix and expect me to know what

396
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,600
 the fuck you're talking about again this is that this is what you you would lose

397
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,960
 your mind Jacob and Matt if you were ever in these writers rooms because

398
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,220
 neelix that's correct neelix was supposed to be the Voyager breakout

399
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,960
 character they're like oh this whole thing this is gonna be such a great

400
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,120
 thing this neelix character and they fucked it up six ways to Sunday they had

401
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,920
 him dating a twelve-year-old it's like guys no no no she was she was like yeah

402
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,600
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's awful I was trying to make it sound a little

403
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:42,200
 more yeah okay so yeah so what it like this looks like she Tara's ugly step

404
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:49,480
 cousin oh the neelix wait there was a female problem is female to Lexi and

405
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,320
 Ethan Phillips they don't allow female to laxians on the internet I bet you

406
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,480
 anything Ethan Phillips is a chill guy from what I've seen of him he seems like

407
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,160
 a nice dude the actor who portrayed neelix that character is so fucking

408
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,600
 annoying and stupid I don't think it's Ethan Phillips's fault I think he's

409
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:17,520
 great exactly that's what I'm saying but he's kind of like oh he loves to like

410
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,880
 sell stuff to people and he's the cook yeah so he's always cooking weird alien

00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,080
 they're they're called lekku actually they're like zoom tight and they're

479
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,840
 bred that way because they've gotten more docile as they reproduce because

480
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,600
 no one wanted to keep the aggressive ones as pets so slowly but surely

481
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:43,740
 they've gotten dangly they just got floopy they got droopy over time the

482
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:54,280
 same thing happens that happened a basset hound ears no did I did I do the

483
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,560
 beholder and scoop fest yes yes I did yeah was that last year or the last one

484
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,560
 we did right that was what you did yeah that's what yeah that was the D&D thing

485
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:11,600
 yeah yeah yeah um thing with the eyeballs that was great I've been I've

486
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,720
 watched Sandman I finished up Sandman on Netflix okay you watched the second

487
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:26,640
 season I did I started to watch that that animated kind of wrap up of the

488
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,340
 final first season that they just put out uh-huh and I and I and I couldn't

489
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:37,400
 even get through it I was too depressed I had to stop it was it I was like our

490
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,240
 where where where's the population at with Neil Gaiman are we allowed to say

491
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,200
 we watch Sandman are like salmon are we not allowed to say we like Sandman I was

492
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,280
 Neil I mean he he's problematic as hell at this point yeah he's been accused of

493
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:04,400
 being a dirty bird that's right at home yeah yep and what stinks I thought

494
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,520
 Netflix did a really good job of creating the comic to the series I didn't

495
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,240
 watch the animated thing I just watched the actual episodes smart because I had

496
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,620
 to nope out after I watched the first five minutes I was like oh god I can't

497
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,400
 take this this is and I basically was like breaking my heart true to the comic

498
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,720
 look at it go and I think it's a fascinating world that was created that I

499
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,600
 really liked when I read it because I was like yeah it doesn't really advance

500
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,360
 it doesn't like it's not driven by like a plot plot more like you just keep

501
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,800
 exploring worlds and the rules that go with the world's similar what we've

502
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,240
 been just doing here today and so I thought like it was really neat

503
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,920
 compelling it's also great to watch before going to bed it's not it's not a

504
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,200
 compelling plot point with cliffhangers so you can just watch one weird dreamy

505
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:52,680
 scene and go right to bed no problem and then I was like I don't think I can talk

506
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,760
 terrified about sleeping at all I've worried about whatever happens once I

507
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,840
 fall asleep can be completely leveraged against me and generations of my family

508
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:07,240
 no problem and oddly enough as you're watching it though the character dream

509
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,560
 which obviously is influenced by Neil Gaiman himself and the whole fashion

510
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:20,360
 trend that came out of that and it's all about guy regretting his past and moving

511
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,200
 around see if he can go about possibly changing who he is and I was like man

512
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,400
 I'm trying to keep my mind off of things and this thing is just poking the bear

513
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:36,040
 of what's happening in real life and it's really strange oh I have a hard time

514
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,200
 with those shows he does not the character does not have a good

515
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,600
 relationship with any of his exes I'll tell you that much right now and so

516
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,320
 wouldn't it be great to see a show one time where everybody's like oh yeah that's

517
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:59,320
 my ex we get along fine but there are actors in it that are amazing I enjoyed

518
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,360
 the first season very much she is really fantastic yeah I watched a few episodes

519
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,920
 of the first season it was good I don't know why I stopped watching it I might

520
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,040
 have just forgotten about it maybe I went to sleep you might have seen the

521
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,160
 whole thing it was only like eight episodes Jacob oh maybe I saw all of it

522
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:24,000
 that yeah cuz they weren't long right no yeah now an hour okay yeah but let's see

523

 earth let's do a little scoop mail we are one from dirty rotten cone artist

525
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:44,040
 dearest Paul your gnome repair operation from episode 1194 wouldn't make an

526
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,280
 excellent YouTube channel you could film your gnome repairs and put them up as

527
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,640
 fun videos you could then parlay that and then selling the gnomes from the

528
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,160
 videos people could send their gnomes in for restorations and you could film

529
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,640
 those and charge for it the money prints itself I look forward to the

530
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,360
 meteoric rise of Paul and Anne Anne's gnome dome fucking with the face that's

531
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:13,140
 the dirty rotten cone artist Paul have you thought about opening up a gnome

532
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,200
 hospital we thought about it we actually did talk about it a little bit and was

533
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,640
 like maybe we could just do this and I was like oh no I'd love to do that

534
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,160
 today so Paul might might be having problems here I said you know and said

535
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,960
 maybe we could just do this and I thought yeah that'd be great but I don't

536
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:40,400
 I don't think so oh I'm gonna work out it's over guys it turns out gnome

537
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:49,320
 repair does not provide health care so but gnome repair content does provide

538
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,960
 extra money that is true I'm not ruling it out in the

539
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,040
 future fixing up stuffed animals I'm not ruling it out in the future I'll tell

540
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,280
 you one problem though with some of that repair video shit I don't know if you

541
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,640

01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:53,320
 the pony express I've read that they did not actually gallop the very far they

653
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,800
 would it was apparently a what do you call like a publicity stunt they would

654
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,680
 gallop into and out of town to make it look like they were just galloping the

655
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,000
 whole time but you couldn't gallop a horse that long so they just gallop in

656
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,720
 and out of town and then just walk the horse that makes it was apparently like

657
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,880

658
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:21,760

664
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:03,520
 choking or stomach upset is a medical emergency done done done done done they

665
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:09,200
 can't regurgitate something right they can't like like like cough something up

666
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:18,400
 and like vomit or vomit regurgitate cough it up I don't know if they swallow

667

 vomit yeah yeah show me vomit vomit there we go man I was you not I was not like

669
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,700
 if you gave yourself points for regurgitate because those are different

670
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:36,840
 things no they're not are they no they're not rotating vomit is not

671
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,920
 regurgitation I believe it just from an attention standpoint no but I mean you

672
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:48,400
 can say that birds regurgitate baby birds mouth the thing that took down our

673
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,560
 podcast with us vomit versus vomit like I went to counter I was like I don't

674
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,800
 want to have this I don't want to have this argument at all I shouldn't have

675
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,200
 even said what I said I suppose there I mean like it's probably the bird

676
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,200
 probably is regurgitating food that hasn't gone all the way past it's uh now

677
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,520
 there has to be a difference I think Matt's right there has to be a

678
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,600
 difference I just don't know what the difference is yeah Matt you're up scoop

 the bacterial agent EIA objection your honor this yes this is scoop stable

703
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,400
 scoop implies ice cream social there have been two pot therapy questions in

704
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:15,320
 this category I'd like it banned I like it stricken sustained sustained this

705
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,440
 question will be stricken from the record information on the blood-borne

706
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:34,320
 bacterial agent EIA there was a horse you've got a disease yeah I mean I I just

707
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:41,660
 don't think there's any way that I would possibly know this pass Matt I'm just

708
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,880
 reading through it to make sure I actually understand the question cuz I

709
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,760
 really didn't the first time I was to be distracted by why am I answering pot

710
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,520
 therapy questions but I'm assuming this is a bit that we did on pot therapy at

711
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,680
 some point that I don't remember yeah it's gonna be a pass for me Jacob Paul

712
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:11,160
 could it be hoof and mouth disease I got hoof and mouth disease from my nieces

715
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,120
 doing mouth that's why I was doing horse sense categorize waiting for the horse

716
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:46,320
 I questioned it never came equine infectious anemia oh that'll just nice

717
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:53,760
 facts as hoof and mouth of course and Matt closing out the category and the

718
01:14:53,760 --> 01:15:01,200
 game scoop stable for 1200 in the show pod therapy which therapist on the show

719
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:08,800
 pod therapy does the most pod theropis Matt that's Jim Jacob if Jacob names a

720
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,520
 foal after the show's tagline its jockey club approved name 18 characters Max

721
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:26,280
 would read like this or preaching fun no uh different different tagline

722
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,720
 preaching fun is really more of our tagline but but maybe something else

723
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:36,480
 that could be confused as a tagline oh what what in the but uh farts in the bag

724
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:48,960
 dot biz keep going I'll just pass Paul I don't know I was going with preaching

725
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,800
 preaching f you but it's I don't know I pass I don't know I mean I wouldn't it

726
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,280

 tit farmers of which are you dick and tit farms of which I am the farmer

728
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:10,720
 right that's yeah that's my answer oh no just preaching fun it's preaching fire

729
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,320
 would have been the whole thing of preaching fun okay I was right I was

730
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:18,280
 right the whole time why doesn't matter cuz I was wrong and so either way Matt

731
