 thought about that oh yeah now he's gonna become a real scent connoisseur I

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,480

 how much is a like like a standard bottle of cologne now how much about a

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,400
 standard bottle of cologne 20 bucks well I spent I spent almost nine for my

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:33,880
 generic I'm ahead of you on this one what we have done is we have ordered

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:44,320
 ambergris in bulk and we're gonna do a DIY cologne kit in our backyard because

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,400
 it's cheaper to just order the whole whale eat the meat and get the ambergris

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,640
 out then to just buy the ambergris separately and plus that gives you oil

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,200
 for your your whale oil right if you like the home if you like the meat you

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,360
 might as well just buy the whole whale that's it why fuck the ambergris when I

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,400
 can fuck the whale for free wait is that how how does it go that's not an

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,080
 expression anywhere but yeah no I'm making in my new expression why smell

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:23,480
 the ambergris when I can fuck the whale for free there you go there you go yeah

36
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,680
 we're gonna put a bunch of vats in the backyard but like you know bourbon in

64
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:40,560

 band yeah I just heard I just from the band I just smelled as much as we can do

80
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,960

81
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,480
 expensive in the perfume world if you keep searching the internet I didn't

82
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,680

 we're gonna do it yesterday which was I've had I've had a couple of clips go

93
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,280
 maybe viral is too strong of a word but my most popular clips clips have taken

94
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,080
 off I get stats right and so yeah these these one a couple of clips do well a

95
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,400
 couple comes do well and also I get stats that say you know 75% of people

96
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,600
 watching and commenting are not your followers right that's like a sign that's

97
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 what you want right right external engagement and it's one where I'm

98
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,280
 handling a dickhead it's just two videos part one and part two I'm handling some

99
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,040
 dickhead at one of my shows this is the state of the world man all people want

100
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,240
 his crowd work and I and it's funny because when things go popular means I'm

101
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,840
 gonna get criticized right so there's a lot of like you're thin-skinned you're a

102
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:12,880
 terrible person that guys making reasonable requests to a show that I

103
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,280
 went to a show and then during the show opened his mouth and just had a

104
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,520
 conversation with the person on stage about what he wasn't doing these are the

105
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,960
 people who are on their phones the entire time that a movie is happening in

106
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,000
 this so we'll do some backstory I'm at Mystique dining and Folsom when with

107
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,880
 that clip right and they just have like a security camera and if you know

108
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,360
 basically for like liability purposes like is a magician loses it which I

109
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,720
 came close to so that's not my camera that's just the the don't get sued

110
00:11:47,720 --> 00:12:00,160
 camera at Mystique dining so a couple things he's he's one in the first clip

111
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,080
 he's lecturing me about how he saw some other magician and he went to bed that

112
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,200
 night he figured out the card trick and he won't let me move on my show unless

113
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,880
 he tells me the story and Mystique dining is a parlor environment right so

114
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,720
 it's me at a table surrounded by 24 people in a room right and I perform at

115
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,280
 a stage where the front row is 30 feet away so when you when you tuber me the

116
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,400
 story yeah there was more to the story than I went to bed and figured it out in

117
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,960
 my sleep there is more to the story and that like okay so what happens is I

118
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,080
 start going I said the first joke is like and no one cares right and it gets

119
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,040
 this it gets this big laugh from the audience and the reason why it's cuz the

120
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,800
 way Mystique dining works is you you go there and you have this opulent

121
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,520
 beautiful meal with everybody in the room before the magician comes out the

122
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,200
 magician is the last 45 minutes of the of the of the experience right so this

123
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,520
 gentleman had been the mayor of dinner yes so when he told me that story it was

124
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:03,440
 probably the fourth time the audience was hearing that oh my god and I'm

125
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,160
 hanging out right I'm back I'm on the backstage area waiting for the things

126
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,080
 so I know this I've already been told this guy keeps telling the story about

127
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,280
 how he figured out a magic trick and he won't stop telling people told he told

128
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,720
 the one waiter told the other waiter he told Steve the the emcee and Booker Steve

129
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,600
 Branham who runs the room told him and then interrupted my show while I was

130
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:34,280
 trying to start a card trick to do it and so it just been blitzing people the

131
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,160
 story the whole time so when I start laying in them I it's getting these

132
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,640
 huge laughs because they freakin heard it they're done with it yeah they're done

133
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,960
 with it now it's weird to have this clip take off for me personally like I I mean

134
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,920
 he's an old guy right it's like I am picking on an old guy right like I do

135
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,840
 feel bad like he's not he's not being an egregious drunk heckler you know

136
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,160
 he's just make himself mayor of the room yeah right and then the second clip is

137
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,040
 when I start to get into my card trick he starts busting my balls for not

138
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,000
 having a sealed deck to start off the thing with okay and some other magicians

139
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,560
 have chimed in going like it's a reasonable request

140
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,720
 magician bullshit magician to magician abuse and you don't have to take it man

141
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,440
 man there's oh I feel you brother I feel you that is that is a nonsensical that

142
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,860
 is awful this business too long bullshit magician responses I've been performing

143
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,900
 for other magicians too long and also is the only people that that would be

144
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,520
 reasonable from is another magician at like a magic conference or something

145
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,520
 like that or in a fool us type setup where they're doing any of that bullshit

146
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,720
 because what you're doing isn't doing you're not teaching people how to do

147
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,440
 fucking card tricks you're doing a show but not even that it's one of those

148
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,880
 things that speaks to ignorance because any magician worth their salt knows that

149
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,720
 sealed or not it doesn't really matter yes you can gimmick a deck to be sealed

150
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,440
 yes sealed it's an ignorant comment it comes from a place of ignorance and

151
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,960
 trying to be ignorant it's trying to wind up it's trying to one at one up no

152
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,800
 I don't even mad at some I dealt with some similar shit at the guy who

153
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,640
 disrupted the show I'm really angrier at the magicians who are defending I don't

154
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:45,800
 see so much in a in a in an improv way recently and it got me it sent me to 11

155
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,920
 immediately I'm just like shut your teaching no no no no no discussing

156
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:58,920
 discussing intros of all things oh I was just like shut the fuck up you are you

157
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,120
 are just talking shit to talk shit now yes yeah it's just like the like devils

158
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,040
 advocating on the fly to make it seem like you're being smart apps of fucking

159
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,080
 yeah giving giving an example oh my god my dogs are going crazy yeah no I was

160
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,320
 just I was talking about it too they're angry no no I want to I want to hear

161
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,760
 your opinion on this Matt so I was just talking about introing and one of these

162
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,800
 simplify an intro because we had previously done an interview and the

163
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,480
 interview got really dark and so at the end I grabbed your line which the this

164
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,760
 is all intended to be comedic in nature yeah yeah to get us out of that death

165
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,640
 spiral yeah and we and we were fine but I said hey in light of the fact that I

166
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,920
 don't think anyone has any fun stories to tell right now about their day to day

167
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,760
 yeah why don't we just go with song titles or rather song lyrics for a get

168
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,840
 right yeah and and I was describing the thing and this is the way I put it I was

169
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,520
 like so we'll get a song you know we'll get a lyric and I want you guys to just

170
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 think about a lyric that you're gonna call out don't you know really ponders

171
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,040
 think about something that actually means something to you don't just shout

172
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,600
 out who let the dogs out just give me a lyric and you know what as a matter of

173
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,880
 fact give me a couple give me like two or three and I'll pick my favorite one

174
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:28,360
 let's see what we do and I got oh you don't want to be fishing yeah wait yeah

175
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:36,840
 thank you is accusing you of trying to cherry-pick the most in that the

176
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,840
 description of how we could do how we could do it not in doing it just in the

177
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,760
 description of saying hey no you give me three I'll pick my favorite and was

178
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,800
 saying oh we don't want to be fishing I'm like you are so wrong on this you

179
00:17:51,800 --> 00:18:01,320
 couldn't be more wrong oh and so I kind of laughed because I was mad to the point

180
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 of explosion and I was like well you know there's burning kind of - we're

181
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,800
 burning the who let the dogs out yeah thing and that kind of thing and and you

182
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,200
 know I did I couldn't in the moment get my head back around but like like even

183
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,960
 Liz the great Liz Allen has articulated to me you can do that you can pick you

184
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,440
 know it's not like you're not I'm not you know first of all look most of the

185
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,680
 time the audience shouts out a bunch of different suggestions at the same time

186
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,040
 anyway usually exactly you've heard anyway so you end up you end up

187
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,320
 assessing the situation anyway the idea no but the idea is that you were you

188
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,920
 were disparaged that's what happened and it took precisely and it made you so

189
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,440
 angry in the moment you couldn't get your words back around on you and I get

190
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,880
 that completely yeah but the idea that someone would use you of like you're

191
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,000
 literally trying to like you he literally just like made you into some

192
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,920
 kind of cheap artists some sort of hack yeah yeah meanwhile you're actually like

193
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,400
 trying to spread a wide net yeah that would drive me crazy yeah I needed some

194
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,800
 validation it's also not a quiz it's not it's not a test it's not like let's see

195
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 who the best Improver is by seeing who can take suggestions the fact is it not

196
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,040
 do this is a goddamn show no shit dude well that's that the ultimate the

197
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,000
 entertaining the that's the ultimate thing is like okay let's go around all

198
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,360
 this loop-de-loop and then the end of the day you're gonna you're gonna show

199
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,520
 me something on stage worth a fucking right reminds me of the time the

200
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,760
 emphasis brigade was on Conan O'Brien early days right so so they were on the

201
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,840
 core for including Amy or Amy Poehler were on the stage and they go like Conan

202
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,100
 Bronson cuz he you know we really love improv and I got hooked into this I was

203
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,240
 like oh they're gonna let them do improv on Conan like this is awesome and they

204
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,200
 go like oh can we just have like you know a setting or whatever they're like

205
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
 all the Swiss mountains they're like oh and then can we have like a character

206
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,120
 from fix you know history like Buddha and like oh and then we have like you

207
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,960
 know whatever something you might count as like it's like cakes or whatever and

208
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,120
 like okay we take you to a mountain where Buddha is having a birthday cake

209
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,360
 and they make like noise in the curtain raises up they have a perfect set of the

210
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,480
 perfect set just made exactly for that right exactly so the idea like so that's

211
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,760
 yeah is that you're like you're like oh wait let me see if I can get it close to

212
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,720
 my my right yeah yeah yeah I'm really hanging on to ain't no holla back girl

213
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,560
 soon as I get no holla back girl then I can strike because I've got a great I've

214
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,200
 got a great Gwen Stefani in the pocket like what the fuck I came here to do a

215
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,560
 Gwen Stefani impression and I'm not leaving until I do it it just made no

216
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,600
 fucking sense to me I'm just like you want to see what you're fishing what

217
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:03,480
 environment was this where were you I've already said okay okay okay it's a weird

218
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,440
 that's a weird one yeah so I should just say like more more on the the clip

219
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,000
 because I told everybody in the zoom there was more to it the clip goes on I

220
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,320
 do get it I do get a sealed back so like right part of part of the things that

221
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,680
 I'm like grappling with as I take on the dumb internet comments is I think I'm

222
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 being funny the whole time I know I'm I know that I'm being upset but I think

223
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,120
 I'm being upset in an amusing way if I thought I was being upset in a way that

224
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,600
 wasn't amusing I would have I would stop and that's the hardest thing to convey

225
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,560
 right like like if you look at the who that goat episode that we did with the

226
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,880
 with the guys right if you go back and listen to that episode on our feed I am

227
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,240
 the butt of that episode and I tee myself up for it numerous times you you

228
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,760
 open that door over and over again yeah but it's what the show needed right so

229
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,440
 I'm all purpose and you served it yeah I do it right so a couple people came up

230
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,560
 to me and they're like hey man that was really tough up there I go what no that

231
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,480
 was exactly everything went exactly the way we wanted you know I remember Justin

232
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,680
 Robert young shooting people like no you don't know what's going to go away stop

233
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,680
 talking to him it's like no I did what was supposed to be done in the show

234
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,760
 right I'm very happy and so it's very hard to convey that like I am taking the

235
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,840
 piss out of the guy I think he knows it a little bit I know it and the audience

236
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,880
 is going with it and so I thought the odds would go with it on the internet as

237
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
 well and for the most part they have right I'm pointing out the the few dicks

238
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:51,720
 but I will say what my social media team edited out what's me finally opening up

239
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 a sealed deck which probably took forever because that's another thing

240
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,640
 about the that's the other joke about like why are you using a sealed deck the

241
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,200
 primary reason is that it is a pain the ass open a fucking back of cards and I

242
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,120
 used to open sealed decks for my tricks and it would sometimes take forever and

243
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,000
 it's got to deal with the cellophane yeah you got to deal with cracking the

244
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,160
 box yeah then you got to dispose how many just that cellophane the two tops

245
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,920
 and the two bottoms here the two jokers on the bottom and the two cards on the

246
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,760
 top instruction cards yeah and then you got a shuffle them and else other stuff

247
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,480
 right and so I do I do I do oftentimes skip a go here's here's the deck I've

248
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,900
 been using from last night look they're all shuffled and I have the person look

249
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,360
 at them and I give them a quick shuffle or they can give him a quick shuffle and

250
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,200
 it's just for time it's just for time yeah it's just but also if you look and

251
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,360
 you see that it's a real deck and if you're handing it to other people that's

252
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,000
 it's 99% of the time that's gonna be just a deck you're not gonna hand a

253
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,880
 gimmick deck to a person right there are tricks I do where I don't have the deck

254
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,360
 sealed but if they if they're looking at the deck and they're able to shuffle

255
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,360
 that deck and hand it back to you that is better than a freshly unsealed deck

256
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,880
 yeah that is as much as clusterfucky as you can get mathematically right so it's

257
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,720
 so it's edited out as I finally get all the cards out and do whatever and I put

258
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,240
 the cellophane and the advertising cards and the stuff right in front of his face

259
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,240
 okay and I go here I'm gonna shuffle while you inspect this garbage is that's

260
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:33,600
 not in the clip that's great that's things like I I actually thought it was

261
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,520
 fun for the audience to actually be annoyed but then follow through on all

262
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,560
 of his demands right so like I did I did I actually did yes and him and do my

263
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,480
 card trick under test conditions but that's not good social media right so

264
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,160
 so that's the hard part is so I'm getting accused of like not playing fair

265
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,320
 with the guy and you're like no I actually if you saw the whole thing you

266
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,880
 did another guy goes I don't get it every every clip I see you and you're

267
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 just some thin-skinned guy losing it and I was like that means you just saw two

268
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,520
 clips yes because my other clubs don't show that my other club don't have it at

269
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 all so I was like alright this good Jesus it's called a brand so yeah I got

270
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,320
 it like I have a tick-tock page I don't even look at that my social media runs

271
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,480
 entirely goes that clip killed on tick-tock and I was like oh man this is

272
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,080
 not it's always the stuff you don't expect though right I know no I mean I

273
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,160
 put that up there thinking it was gonna be something I when I said the cuz like

274
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,620
 I said it's a security camp footage so I said right I said this is this is bad

275
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,360
 this bad quality but I think this will play and so I was actually right in that

276
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:04,120
 well good instincts yeah I'll tell you else only wants to see seal dicks and

277
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,120
 that's the following sponsor today's show Matt manly's ice cream social is

288
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,600
 the mayor of the night was really cherry-picking what business he wanted

 to attend I'm sorry it was in fact it was offended by it was in fact a

290
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000

293
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,160
 great as soon as tick-tock starts to monetize I would tell you also the

294
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,640
 weird thing about it is because I've had some of those clips do well but they've

295
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,160
 not gained me followers this one's gaining me a bunch of followers which is

296
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:33,080

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,180
 similar to your brand as a magician like do they compliment each other and I said

302
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:11,040
 oh not at all no I'm a relatively clean magician and I am absolutely filthy on

303
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:19,360
 this show so no it does not not exactly brand synergy no I started off as a

304
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,440
 magician I was filthy when I started there so originally it did it did

305
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,240
 compliment each other right right but I don't I was remembering that I used to

306
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,120
 ask for a borrowed iPhone by asking for a hand jobs machine right yes for the

307
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,800
 hands jobs machine I asked for the hand jobs machine I still haven't donated my

308
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,840
 Halloween candy I gotta look for a place to do that still I got 20 pounds of

309
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,840
 candy download just send it with a Sarah to work she'll bring it to work it'll be

310
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,600
 gone in 20 minutes European acrobats we'll eat the shit out of that candy we

311
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,160
 already got we already got snow up here oh no yeah yeah yeah we already got snow

312
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,440
 and it actually stuck to the ground so I'm very concerned about what's coming

313
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:18,760
 this winter yeah yeah yeah but I'm also pleased to say that my Christmas

314
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,920
 decorations went up at a very timely time because half the neighborhood is up

315
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,040
 and cooking now a week after I put my stuff up so it's it's all good you're a

316
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 trendsetter buddy I was I was speaking of our regional news Jacob are you

317
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:45,160
 excited that the shuck era has begun down in New Orleans what's happening so

318
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,880
 is this a is this a ballplayer of some kind yes let me say some my kids are

319
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,560
 suddenly into football enough that they're curious about watching it when I

320
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:02,480
 watch it okay but part of it was we were sitting around two quarterbacks came up

321
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:10,160
 one was Michael Pennex from Atlanta my kids literally were like does that say

322
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:18,760
 Penix and they were hysterical that someone else playing football has a

323
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:28,940
 robot penis called called the Penix and we just made robot penis jokes if the

324
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,440
 Atlanta Falcons were smarter they would follow your lead oh yeah and then then

325
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:42,200
 it was the beginning of the Tyler shuck era in New Orleans and which my kids are

326
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,320
 really loving being part of the shuck era they don't give a shuck they're part

327
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,600
 of the mother shuckers they're ready to rock is it his name pronounced show is

328
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,840
 that true I don't think it I don't think you say the C at all in his name oh I

329
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,480
 have only listened to anyone pronounce it shuck is it pronounced is it

330
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:10,000
 mispronounced I I thought it was Tyler show I don't know okay I could just as

331
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,720
 easily be the person wrong here is it Patrick wah is that right yeah the old

332
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,480
 hockey player there's some new ones too there's a new Roz out there are there

333
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,400
 more was there are there's one who plays for Vegas now yeah but yeah no that's

334
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:34,400
 that's great and to answer the question you're really asking I can't get behind

335
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,960
 the New Orleans Saints this year at all they're just so bad I get I mean we're

336
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,500
 on we're on our own text message shades and everything so Matt sees that I get

337
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,480
 genuinely aggravated when New Orleans wins the game we want the draft pick

338
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,760
 stop it yeah what are your guys sincere feelings now that the FBI has come out

339
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,880
 and said that all of all of organized sports is a Psyop is there I guess you

340
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,940
 haven't really lost interest it hasn't changed my view on it in any way okay

341
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,640
 because there's not a single part of what they're saying that I'm surprised

342
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,760
 about right I don't know what you're talking about Paul oh that's a just you

343
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,920
 know the corruption of betting throughout all the coincides with the

344
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,080
 fact that like games are fixed and rigged and yeah fixed by the Mafia

345
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,960
 leaning in on on individual players so it's scarier than it being rigged like

346
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,640
 ha ha ha they wrote a book of football or something like oh it's scarier yeah

347
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:49,160
 but it's yeah but it's funny so what's crazy to me is specifically the

348
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:56,560
 pitchers indicted for throwing a first pitch ball on purpose right because

349
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,120
 that I know it sounds strange but the competitive balance of that is really

350
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,720
 funny to me because everyone's happy right so if you're betting the first

351
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,920
 pitch is gonna be a strike that's a really hard task for the pitcher right

352
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:15,120
 but the batter also wants the first pitch to be a ball right and and the

353
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,640
 other team wants the first pitch to be a ball so the idea that like I'm gonna

354
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,880
 throw a ball first the catcher is to just go like oh let me just stick my

355
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,200
 glove over here no problem like it's like the ease of everyone making money

356
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,880
 off of a first pitch ball is hysterical to me because it's like everyone's like

357
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,840
 great that's just easy and fun and for basketball and for basketball it's

358
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,120
 hysterical where people are betting unders mean that like I'm gonna go in

359
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,560
 and not rebound I'm not gonna grab a ball I'm like that to me is like

360
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,400
 hysterical and as you uncover the stories like these are people who are

361
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,840
 making a lot of money suddenly making money on like dumb bets that don't pay

362
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:03,480
 in the in the arena of the money that they're making right and so like one of

363
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,040
 the players it turns out like he just had never paid his taxes on his crazy

364
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,720
 NBA salary and had just a crazy ass tax lien that he was trying to get out of

365
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:20,080
 and so that's why he got into it people being roped into illegal poker games

366
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,160
 the poker game thing with like Chauncey Billups and all those yes that's that's

367
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,720
 bizarre and what this one Paul no so it's literally like sports celebrities

368
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,360
 luring just other motherfuckers into playing poker games with them and then

369
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,920
 not playing an honest poker game yeah so so illegal poker yes I did hear about

370
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,720
 that illegal poker rooms and states that don't have legalized gambling of the

371
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,280
 ice poker running illegal poker game so they're running these crazy rooms using

372
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,240
 celebrities basketball players to lure in people with money yeah and then using

373
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,000
 literally like microchipped cards and like I saw I saw technology I saw like

374
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,720
 right they had these glasses on and you could see every card like every card was

375
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,560
 clearly visible from the back like I knew what everybody had the whole time

376
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,400
 yeah it's wild and I was laughing at someone who's one of those sports

377
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,320
 podcast listeners a big card collector and stuff as he goes to card collecting

378
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,280
 conventions and he goes I mean I don't want to say nothing but I was wondering

379
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:32,160
 why Chauncey Billups was at every one of these events why is this active NBA

380
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,760
 coach and Hall of Fame basketball player finding time to go to every card event

381
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:51,400
 there is he's getting paid like 50 G's each time because coaches make the

382
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,080
 fucking doughnuts coaches make millions right so like the idea is no way these

383
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:01,000
 card things are paying and like that's actually worth the time but yes they are

384
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,440
 in a way they are in a way yeah right yeah it's just free money that's crazy

385
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,960
 what's crazier is the argument so like what happens is this is this is a thing

386
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,200
 where both sides think they're totally correct right we should stop all this

387
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,440
 legalized gaming gambling on sports it's gonna mess with people's lives right and

388
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,880
 then the fucking degenerates that are like no no no by having the best out

389
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,460
 there and we and we're catching these these spikes of weird bets we're

390
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,480
 exposing what could be happening behind the scenes or off off books and smaller

391
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,120
 books other places like you want to keep it out and play in sight you want to

392
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,320
 get some I feel like that's a really good point I think it's a good point

393
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,840
 with all of them except for first pitch ball that's the only one that I'm like

394
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:58,760
 you just can't everyone's favor to do it like it's just everyone will take it

395
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,040
 it's the worst thing what do you think about the always go into game seven

396
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,440
 thing or often going to game seven thing oh I don't we've tried to rig that I

397
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,400
 don't I don't think those stuffs can be that on that level I don't think things

398
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,680
 can be rigged on that level I just don't think that's tough I mean especially

399
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,960
 with this World Series which was crazy great the amount of ones I went to

400
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,880
 extra innings I mean you can't say let's have one game go to 18 innings when they

401
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,200
 have to play the next day at 5 o'clock like yeah no one's writing that right

402
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,800
 like no one's Reagan that but the fact that three of the games that went went

403
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,120
 to extra innings I think in the World Series including including one literally

404
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,440
 literally a bonus game they literally did 18 innings they accidentally played

405
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:52,240
 yeah they don't they played eight games so I think it's just I think it's it's

406
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,640
 just a testament to the competitiveness of you know these athletes are still

407
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,560
 athletes are they're still psychotic to be professional athlete you have to be a

408
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,200
 psycho like we have to remember right so I don't I think you'd only rig it so

409
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,680
 much football being the hardest one right like that's the one where like you

410
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,720
 you can't oh football is is just impossible to rig the full game without

411
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,120
 like truly cooperation well that yeah conspiracy theory level cooperation if

412
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,280
 you like leave these real dumb plays where you're like oh that was an

413
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,680
 intentional fuck up but the thing is the thing is it's so precious right so like

414
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,640
 if you drop a pass on purpose yeah to underperform to pay a bet you you might

415
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,600
 get yanked out of a game for good like like like you're right it's so the

416
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,600
 marketing that ego for those guys too yeah like the a team maybe scores four

417
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,720
 or five times you know an entire game you know they basically get like eight

418
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,080
 to ten chances at driving it's just not there's just not enough leeway for

419
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,760
 someone to purposefully underperform and then not suffer dramatic professional

420
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,400
 consequences for it yeah it's just not it's just not the this is the I mean I

421
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,080
 could be proven wrong I would be some of the stuff that's come out it's been

422
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:14,680
 baffling I reserved the right to be corrected but so far I mean look look at

423
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,560
 look at me like the Giants are trying the hardest and for three quarters

424
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,040
 they'll do well and then for the fourth quarter I guess you could probably

425
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,520
 that's your best argument it's that the Giants are paid by the mafia to stop

426
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,560
 trying in the fourth quarter there's really not a lot of evidence to support

427
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,960
 against that you take that's pride fucking with you that just seems like

428
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:43,160
 it might be true yeah I again I have made good on my promise not to watch any

429
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,680
 NFL this season and I haven't but I do see the memes keep coming up in my feed

430
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,600
 because I am in the Pittsburgh area and you can't avoid it and it's just every

431
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:02,560
 week I see them I see Steelers shame themselves like stuff like that like

432
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,720
 Steelers embarrassed and in primetime and I'm like of course you hired a

433
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,440
 schlocky freak to be your new QB they are a confusing team they're confusing

434
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,920
 team you ain't kidding why I'm glad I'm not watching this year because it's just

435
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,000
 dumb every time they're like these guys are dirt they come out and they score

436
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,740
 like a thousand points and they look like a juggernaut and then right you go

437
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,840
 like oh I guess they're good and then they're like oh we can't score at all

438
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,360
 no no no no ten scoop says the Giants are great it's the damn game that's too

439
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:44,680
 long yeah you're right we've got that fourth quarter out yeah three period

440
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,800
 game why don't we just if they just copied hockey to be undefeated three

441
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:56,440
 quarters in my in my family in my family in my family text read my oldest

442
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,520
 brother said it he doesn't trust anyone who dies their beard anyway and I said I

443
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:08,400
 feel attacked and then the goes right though and the coach got fired and I

444
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,200
 this week and I just thought up it's bad week for the beard die boys bad bad one

531
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,680
 that's exactly what happened to Las Vegas post-pandemic before the pandemic

532
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,480
 is to say it all the time I was like wait till people from California realize

533

 they can sell one of their houses and buy two out here and then just commute as

534
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,880
 needed as soon as the work from home thing took off that's exactly what

535
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,000
 happened out here is we can't even get one house in Vegas but we could get one

536
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,800
 in Pennsylvania right yeah well it's close to Pennsylvania that West

537
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,880
 Virginia is one of the few states that have a uptick in in population because

538
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,520
 the one thing people left those these terrifying hell scapes and went to West

539
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,960
 Virginia and bought all the land you could have right now the big the big

540
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,560
 race out there's the Breeders Cup the Breeders Cup just wrapped up so that it

541
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,120
 just the first week in November it wrapped up so that's the world was what

542
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,040
 was the big news what was the big scuttlebutt from the Breeders Cup last

543
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:01,960
 minute scratches horses got all the way to the gate and they they were not

544
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,600
 allowed to participate because of due restrictions because we have federally

545
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,080
 oversight it now we have federal oversight gate it got all the way to the

546
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:18,400
 gate and they were like no not you there's like leading horses off the

547
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,320
 track yes and it's like oh okay and then like owners just embarrassing it's

548
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,200
 really embarrassing when your horse has to be led off the track by the pony

549
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:35,480
 without a saddle on the reasons the differing reasons but but veterinarians

550
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:42,760
 seeing signs of soreness or or not okay unsound horses but the track that they

551
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,600
 run it at the particular track had a problem for a couple of seasons of an

552
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,800
 unusual amount of horse deaths not that particular track the okay the track

553
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,640
 you're thinking of is Santa Anita which is in Los Angeles oh yes you're right

554
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,280
 the track here I have to say has one of the highest safety ratings in the world

555
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,400
 it's it's it's San Diego got it okay okay I'm mixing it I'm mixing my West

556
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,000
 Coast tracks this track was built how dare you this and I'm Paul if you want

557
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,240
 to warm up this track was built on in 1939 on a loan taking against taken

558
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:30,380
 against the life insurance policy of Bing Crosby that's true so somebody just

559
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:35,960
 bet against being living and won 100% they shorted being Crosby's life

560
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:43,640
 insurance to build this track how does that even work it was a friend his name

561
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:54,360
 Pat O'Brien so I'm fucking friend yeah very buddy boy I gotta let you know this

562
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,600

564
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:19,040

566
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:40,080
 person just like just don't mind me I'd sure like to race today I just fell

567
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:46,920
 down the stairs fell in the paddock you know what I I should have cooked the

568
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,760
 dinner right I should have cooked the oats right oh you you don't know Bob

569
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:01,400
 Baffert like I do he can change I can change them everyone the other claim to

570
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,480
 fame of this of this track is that this is the place where Chris Jenner and

571
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:19,880
 Robert Kardashian first met oh so everybody brings it up like that's this

572
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:29,440
 boy is that what's going on I didn't hear you go ahead is is it an old cursed

573
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,400
 Indian burial ground as well is that what's going on with that fucking place

574
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,160
 kind of might as well be it was fucking Shawnee ghost popping up in the middle

575
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,320
 race during World War two this track was used as a as a plane wing assembly

576
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:52,000
 factory where was the where was the fancy wing assembly factory that is a

577
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,520
 really interesting Beverly Hills here in Del Mar that's a really interesting

578
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,880
 tidbit I wonder what they use Santa Anita for and then everybody immediately

579
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:08,160
 was like don't ask so then I looked it up and it's like oh what was it it was an

580
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:15,640
 internment camp yeah and I was like well that's not that's good not gonna be on

581
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:36,040
 the tour that they at least get to race the horses so what were the big horses

582
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,000
 that won and should we keep keep an eye on them for upcoming not for long

583
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,260
 episodes and then also what was the attendance like oh absolutely so the

584
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:52,160
 attendance was was was like a thousand down from land from last year okay a

585
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,260
 thousand fewer guests which is hardly noticeable in a place like that you're

586
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,480
 talking about sixty three thousand people over two days okay okay okay okay

587
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:06,080
 and then the so your current world champions are the Japanese are the

588
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,160
 current world champions of horse racing oh they the the current world champion is

589
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:18,840
 a horse named forever young from from Japan okay did Japanese horses usually

590
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:25,160
 do well in these races so I last year they sent 19 horses to this event and

591
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:31,220
 and they won none of the 14 races no that's a tough that's and I said they

592
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:38,800
 could have sent 19 hermit crabs and got the same result so this year guess who

593
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,800
 called Newman's bluff and sent 19 hermit crabs literally they can't they sent nine

594
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:50,280
 horses this year and just absolutely crushed oh wow okay all right well then

595
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,360
 that's exciting we'll have to look out for so they're figuring it out and then

596
00:57:53,360 --> 00:58:01,040
 I I got to briefly talk to micropoly listen to not for long micropoly is a

597
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:07,200

602
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,520
 this is the best thing if you again not for long podcast that the shirt tries

603
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,240
 to make it crazy that Frankie's still racing at his age and then we find out

604
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:48,480
 that it's very common for racers to race at his age they say down those lock and

605
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,440
 he's just trying to clutch at any opportunity he gets and he ends up

606
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,640
 working with Bob Baffert one of the world's famous trainers and they give

607
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,560
 them a horse in the Breeders Cup so it's like really that's the it's the last the

608
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,520
 last that's that hard Scrabble Road we're following with him he's just

609
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:12,880
 falling on hard times but possibly due to his suspension and we will just say

610
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,640
 for legal purposes made up the fact that we also think he's a coke head and so we

611
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,520
 often make jokes about that as well total fabrication we're just a comedy

612
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,480
 show we're just a comedy show we're just wacky we're wacky guys we made Robin

613
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,360
 Lee to cut the maniac we just do these things and so we can't be held

614
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:41,160
 responsible for things that we make up Frankie to Tory's bread surrogate so

615
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:50,040
 Frankie he would never eat bread that guy get real that man hasn't seen a carb in

616
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:56,560
 30 years so Frank he did not he was not riding the Japanese horse I imagine he

617
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,080
 was not all right. Well, I'm still looking out for that tough luck kid. I

618
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,360
 feel like he's still going to find a place to shine. He's going to land on

619
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,960
 his feet somewhere all four of them.

620
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:14,800
 Well, thank you. Thank you Newman for I want. I wanted my Breeders Cup update. Oh

621
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,640
 wait. Also, how's the how's the horse you and my dad bought claims in as that

622
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,960
 horse still training well looking for that first start should be fine at that

623
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,880
 point your dad's gonna have a lot of fun with that it should be fun. What's the

624
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:36,840
 site you guys went to? Yeah my racehorse.com. My racehorse.com you can buy really small

01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,000
 hundred twenty dollars share of like a five hundred thousand dollar horse. Is your

627
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:57,640
 father the world's oldest brony at this point? My dad? Yeah. World's oldest like

628
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,760
 that's the world's oldest brony. He's basically a My Little Pony fanboy. Yes.

629
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,440
 He's basically living out of My Little Pony fantasy. This is amazing. Yes. Yeah.

630
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,520
 Does he have does he have a small statuette replica of the horse? That's

631
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,360
 how I should get him for Christmas. Actually get him a custom pony. Get him a

632
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,840
 little get him a My Little Pony with whatever share it is like one you know

633
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:31,080
 three thousand. Do they do some horse hair in an envelope? My Little Ponies

634
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:36,160
 like they do custom the the if only there was a way that you could figure

635
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:48,200
 that out. Oh my god. What's Briarfest? Okay so Briar horses are the the

636
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:53,840
 collectible horse action figures. What? They're made by the Briar company and

637
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,920
 they're not getting into that. I dodge that fucking bullet. I bet. And they have a

638
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:08,200
 full-blown like week-long festival for these plastic horses here in Lexington

639
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:18,920
 every year. Oh my gosh. And they are fanatical. To the point where we think

640
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:27,640
 about closing to tours during that time. Oh there's so many people come out for

641
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,440
 the for the for the horses for the toy horses. They will they'll buy two hotel

642
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,960
 rooms at the Clarion and they will get permission to remove the furniture from

643
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,720
 one of them and set up. And they just turn it into a store. A store for people who will do your your

644
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:58,880
 plastic horse's hair for you like a salon. Yes dude. On their website they've got like

645
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,080
 pictures of these of these this horse that they are I guess introducing the

646
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:12,240
 2026 Briarfest celebration horse Corgi Hill Flinka. And it's a real horse. Yeah yeah

647
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,400
 it's just a picture of a real horse and then right below it they've got like the

648
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,080
 plastic things that they've made of that horse. And they and the kids I give to

649
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,360
 their credit they did a good job. The adults will fist fight over that horse.

650
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:30,520
 Right. I can't picture someone getting their horse's doll's hair done to

651
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:38,560
 present it to another person like huh. Oh you can't. They have they have a

652
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:44,640
 legitimate show. Let me bring you into my world. Wait but do you show off the grooming of the hair of your

653
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,600
 figures? It's all about customization. Yep. So you get your base you get your base

654
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,840
 bucks yo like this is your standard buck and then it's all about people who can

655
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,600
 trick these things out. There's a guy I follow on YouTube. His channel is Mr.

656
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:10,520
 Home Arcade. This cat has got money and he gets four of everything basically. Yeah.

657
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:16,840
 And he also pays all these other awesome creators to send him customs. So the

658
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:24,440
 stuff that he has is one-offs, totally unique, but really cool, really well done.

659
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:30,400
 But a lot of it is you take the base figure and then just build on it from that.

660
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,680
 Yeah yeah yeah. So it's all about that base. True or false Newman? One of the

661
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,880
 biggest Briar collectibles is just a Catherine the Great with her legs wide

662
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:58,480
 open. Catherine the Great playset would sell like hotcakes. Talking about fist fights. That is the longest, saddest fist fight.

663
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:12,680
 There's gonna be two punches. Me hitting you and you hitting the band. Me hitting you and me hitting your surface.

664
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:21,960
 And yes Scoop Jesus with legs wide open. But they do like custom saddle readers. A person making tiny little

665
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,800
 saddles out of real leather. See that's where that's when it gets really yeah

666
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:34,680
 yeah yeah yeah. See with with the Masters of the Universe especially, that's my forte, it gets to

667
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,120
 like characters and people that were featured in the cartoons that have never

668
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,200
 been made into figures. Which that's getting that list is getting smaller and

669
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,400
 smaller and smaller. Of course. But there are still some and these

670
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,000
 people want these one-off figures. It's been their dream like oh I really want

671
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,360
 this figure from this episode and if it's never been made people will make it.

672
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,680
 But then the interesting thing is the fandom will respond and if it's a nice

673
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,320
 enough custom and enough people go oh well I really wish I had that figure too.

674
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:11,120
 Mattel follows those boards and they build out figures based on fan demand

675
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:15,480
 and that's how we get a lot of these really rare weird one appearance. I'm

676
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,640
 telling you right now the person making custom leather saddles for those Briar

677
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:24,040
 outfits doesn't know that there's a whole battle cat saddle universe out

678
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,000
 there. Oh yeah I don't know I thought they might be they might know they might

679
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,480
 know. Looking at some of those Mondos but but that's it that's the fact too is I

680
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:41,360
 would not be surprised if some of those what do you call that Newman the whole

681
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:50,080
 ensemble. I guess it's a lot of livery right? The tack. The livery the tack is

682
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,200
 that what it's called? It can be livery yeah. So that would encompass the what

683
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:00,000
 the Jockey rides, what the Jockey wears, the colors. Oh that's livery for sure yes. And then the

684
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,880
 saddling and all that kind of stuff would be tack. So I mean I'm gonna go out

685
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,640
 on a limb and say there's probably been an occasion where a model tack maker has

686
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:18,960
 inspired a real-life replicae. Oh sure oh yeah I'm sure I was worried we were

687
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,320
 gonna look at this like as a strictly parasitic relationship but no no no it's

688
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:31,920
 copacetic. What are you talking about? I agree symbiotic. Symbiotic yeah not copacetic. Yeah yeah yeah no these guys these guys

689
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,680
 absolutely inspire you know the the big boys to make the big toys. That's how it

690
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,920
 goes. Alright does have three battle cat saddles already you're right Rich Scoob. I

691
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,840
 have more than three. So past Breeders Cup how long is your season out there

692
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,840
 Newman? I'm getting right ahead home just for it to be cold in

693
01:07:52,840 --> 01:08:00,700
 Kentucky. And then what's the next big race on the radar for possible

694
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,640
 Triple Crown people because the Breeders Cup starts at all right? The Breeders Cup

695
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,200
 starts at all the Breeders Cup Juvenile starts at all and then the next in March

696
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,800
 there there are some there are lots of there's the the Arkansas Derby there's

697
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,800
 the Rebel Stakes there's a Florida Derby but what everybody's really got their eye

698
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,840
 on because of the international horses that are making a bigger impact is that

699
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,640
 the Dubai World Cup the the United Arab Emirates Derby is probably gonna be the

700
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:38,080
 next. Oh that's that's early early March. Okay flying horses makes me scared. Mayor

701
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:46,400
 Force One. So cuz dude do Americans set up their best horses to Dubai or is it

702
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,000
 all cautious thing? Oh always. You said a horse flight's the most boring flight

703
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,600
 in the world right? I hate it so much. Well it's not that boring it's like a

704
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,360
 it's like fucking Russian roulette the way you described it. Yeah standing on

705
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:10,400
 there with with a knee with a put down and a dope up in both hands. It's almost always a very

706
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:19,280
 boring flight. It's the ride of your life. That that reminds me of how I used to

707
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:27,240
 describe being a fireman. Oh yeah. It was just long periods of just complete

708
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:35,920
 boredom and then every once in a while it goes freestyle crazy. So that's about

709
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,600
 what it is. Okay back to chili. I forgot about the

710
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:49,240
 put down juice Paul. How could you? You can murder a horse at 30,000 feet that's

711
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:54,160
 amazing. Numerous times someone has spent tens of thousands of dollars to ship a

712
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,880
 horse to somewhere and have it arrive dead. That's what has happened.

713
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:05,000
 The numbers not zero. And you know what else that makes me sad about that is just like my

714
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,680
 recent experience with the injected dye. I'll wager that if you put death juice

715
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:14,060
 in a horse you can't really go glue or meet with that bad boy either. That's

716
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:17,480
 pretty best. You're pretty much just throwing him on a fire pit or great

717
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:29,240
 question Paul. Nick how edible is a horse after you kill it? So it's okay. Yeah all

718
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:35,120
 right. The half life's pretty low. Well it's kind of like how much rat feces

719
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:40,240
 they'll let into a McDonald's hamburger. How much phenylbarbatol they'll

720
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:47,680
 allow into an average mix of puppy chow. I don't know what's going on. Skippy's

721
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:56,480
 just kind of logy today. He got his breakfast. I don't know. Ate a lot of horse meat. He had his

722
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:05,840
 purina. He had his kennel ration. I don't know. Thank you Newman. Thank you Newman. We're going to do a little Jack vs. Nerd.

723
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:13,560
 Buddy thank you guys. Go get them. Purino failure. Here we go.

724
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:44,840
 Jack vs. Nerd. Explosion. Of irradiated horses. Oh they didn't make it. Oh that's too bad. Man I paid a lot of money for this

725
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,360
 flight. Do I get any of that money back or anything? Oh no no no no. Oh I guess

726
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,520
 you did transport the horse. That is that is all I paid you to do.

727
01:11:53,520 --> 01:12:00,040
 That seems only fair. By the way the ladies lounge is the name of the

728
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,260
 Tasmanian Museum Mona. It's the name of the art installation in Mona. It was

729
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:10,720
 ruled illegal by the the first judges who dealt with it. It has gone through to

730
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,200
 the Tasmanian Supreme Court who did uphold the legality of the exhibition's

731
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:20,720
 women-only policy. There are now ways that men can see it. There are a couple

732
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,840
 different ways that they've made it so that male visitors can go in and

733
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:31,400
 see the display. It features what you were saying Matt. It features

734
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,840
 expensive jewelry and art including Picasso canvases as a comment on sexism

735
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,200
 and historical exclusion. Though some pieces were later revealed to be fakes

736
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,360
 or replicas. I guess you're making the point. Yeah that was it. He

737
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:51,520
 inadvertently made the point of you know how dare you exclude me. Oh yeah. Meanwhile

738
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,520
 women have been excluded from male spaces forever and there are still so

739
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,040
 many of those things still on the books today. Yeah so it's almost like that guy

740
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:08,640
 didn't didn't get it. He didn't. He really didn't. We got a scooper coming to us today from

741
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,880
 Canadian Scoop Crystal. Canadian Scoop Crystal sent a whole email along with

742
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,360
 this. We will get to that email at a different show. I've got it set up in the

743
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:21,840
 queue. This is a scooperty all about Canada. It's provinces, Canadian singers,

744
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:30,280
 Canadian actors/rests. Actresses. Oh that makes sense and animals. Oh it's me first.

745
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:36,160
 I'll try animals for 200. What animal is found on our nickel and started the fur

746
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:44,760
 trade? I mean your mom. Oh it's your mom and it's her beaver because it's also a

767
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:17,400
 as far as I know it was staged. Well I we actually I thought about trying to even

 have him come on but I know one of the writers of the movie. Okay. I know who

769
