 So I'm literally gonna leave Chicago go to Missouri and come back to Chicago and finish the run

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,780
 Holy you're not doing the show in Chicago and it's a good thing

 For the for the money and I said do I have to lose the whole weekend or can you replace me for just one night?

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,040
 I said we can replace you for just one night, which is very unusual. So I was very very happy

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,360
 That's wonderful that they did that for you. Yes. Yeah, maybe maybe somebody was in town or something

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
 So does that mean another airplane trip?

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,340
 It do you have to go to the airport fly to St. Louis drive two hours to do the show. Oh my god

30
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,820
 That it's an amount of money that makes that worth it. Hey, so it's fine

 Precisely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is an amount of money that I will I will go to the St. Louis Airport today

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,600
 I actually was warned they're like they're like this is gonna be just a bunch of drunk people

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,320
 Fucking with you

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,000
 Basically being told it was blood money. Do you want to do it? I was like, yep

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,720
 I was like you make me fine with blood money a corporate paycheck before before Christmas

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,560
 Certainly that sounds lovely. Do you get to bring your beers this time?

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,120
 Because of that kind of situation. Oh give him actual beers. Yeah. Oh

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
 Good point. I should just give out actual beers

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,400
 Yeah, yeah, I've there are they're already what the fuck you're just I believe it's called piling on. Yeah

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,160
 Is anyone in here Missouri scoop? Is there like a Missouri trash beer? That's like locally like a good trash beer in Missouri

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,280
 That's that's oh, would that be like a yingling or something? Hey, that's a Pennsylvania trash beer. Thank you very much

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 My wife loves the yinglings

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,840
 No, I think it's the answer oh

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,560
 Mike Neal said in the chat just says everything in Missouri is trash. So that's good news, man. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,220
 I switched it in text to some other beer when we did brushwoods that one time

46
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,720
 I forget I forget now the name of that beer. Oh, there's like large star and fart. Yeah. Yeah fart star fart star. Oh

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,680
 Old style Chicago's a good it might be a good call. That's a good. That's a nice

48
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,280
 cheap beer old style

49
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:26,800
 Just go like go like oh do they still make those fucking ones with the old men who drank

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
 Bartles and James

51
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,240
 Do they still make Bartles and James the wine cooler? Yeah

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,080
 No idea where you're going with the two old men

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,920
 Do they still make Schlitz Laurie else Roth? Oh, let's

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,160
 What's is all this is in the era of Pat's Blue Ribbon Schlitz is also a comedy word

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,360
 Yes, let's is a great word as is Blatt's

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,040
 Ranch slunk coming through with Blatt's Ballentine's there's Ballentine's ale back in the day

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,280
 Anyhow, yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out Schlitz

58
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:14,200
 Yes, let's is still made and is currently owned by Pat's Brewing Company. There we go Wow

59
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,160
 They reintroduced the original 1960s formula

60
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,840
 It's it's brewed in Milwaukee, but Milwaukee as we know Milwaukee and Missouri both start with an M. So I think that's fine

61
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,840
 they have a

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,060
 Some kind of cornered market on all the

63
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:41,180
 Nasty sounding names for beers. This is classic old beers. It's classic old factory worker beers, man. They all just sounded like

64
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,440
 bodily functions

65
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,640
 Schafer's

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,900
 Yeah, I got I got a bad case of the Schafer's. I should have I should have got the Vax when I had the chance

67
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,200
 No, I'm not. I'm going through Milwaukee

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,000
 with the with the jokers of magic I

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,080
 Was there last time we built the fooler show in Milwaukee and doing Pabst at the Pabst Center was like so fun. Oh, right

70
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
 I

71
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,000
 thought it was more cool than the audience did the audience didn't give a shit, but I

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,680
 Thought it was super fun

73
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,640
 They Pabst their prime. Yep, they're perhaps they are perhaps

74
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:25,280
 I finished up my f1 weekend. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. How was the rest of f1? Well, yeah, I was

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 basically trying to figure out the story didn't end with last time we were recording so I didn't get into too much of the

76
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,440
 nitty-gritty details, but right the bottom line is the

77
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,680
 They thought it'd be really funny to have two inept announcers announce some of the marquee events at the ski lodge

78
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,600
 For all three nights at at the at the F at the Mercedes tents, right?

79
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,920
 And a race is about an hour and a half long and having inept announcers

80
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,440
 For an hour and a half for an hour and a half is a little is a little long

81
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,240
 Are you one of the inept announcers? Yes

82
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,560
 And what was it

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,480
 Did you have breaks?

84
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,920
 Yes, or more importantly, did the audience have breaks? Well, we

85
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,420
 Eventually, we figured out yes, you know good good. So we

86
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,320
 But it was funny was like so we we were brought in right and then we came up with all these things for all these

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,480
 Characters to be I came up with Stetson barber. You can call me big Barbie

88
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
 and

89
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,480
 We were gonna do all these games and everything and

90
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:38,440
 All the sudden we were at our first brainstorm session that said oh we just have to you know film something in senator Mercedes

91
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
 Just so they know what's going on. Oh Jesus

92
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,280
 Exactly exactly exactly

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,640
 Instantly so I was like film what like what are we shooting over right and it was like, you know

94
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,880
 And so it was me and Casey Wilson, right?

95
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
 friend of the print of the show we love Casey Casey and

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
 Mercedes based out of

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,420
 Germany. Well, yeah international

98
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,720
 international

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,440
 Automobile behemoth Mercedes-Benz. Yeah, where's their core base? Is it Germany? I mean, they're they're originally from Germany

100
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,320
 I don't know where they're based now, right?

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,080
 Now's your chance to put on your best German and give them the kind of inept announcer

102
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
 That's really gonna sell it. Oh

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 My neighbor. I can't believe what is happened with the car

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,600
 The tires they're rolling over and over as a part holes and and the part holes are wet

105
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,360
 Why are we so much rain in Vegas?

106
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,680
 The rain

107
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,360
 Mercedes still based in Germany. Yes Mercedes are going to bends the rules to win. That is what we do

108
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,280
 So

109
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
 Welcome F1. I'm your host Dieter

110
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,360
 Exactly. Now it's the time much brackets for every race

111
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,520
 That's that's next year Matt. You just Pete Dieter

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,240
 So we're filming by the way, like Casey and I came in for like a brain door, you know a day at the office

113
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 Brainstorming session we weren't dressed

114
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,260
 like particularly flashy or well or in character or anything and

115
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,440
 So didn't have your you had your casual tuxedo on not your show tuxedo

116
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,000
 And so we had different people to manage the project different people to brainstorm. There wasn't necessarily a distinct director

117
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,800
 So we're going to make this video I was like what's so what's this video like they just want to see stuff and I was like

118
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
 which stuff, you know, and so I

119
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,040
 Kind of help orchestrate like a four phase flow to take one of the video, right?

120
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,640
 Good and we finish and I go, okay. Well, that's the take and then I go we can we can cut up the best bits of

121
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
 That maybe it maybe we'll do another run

122
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:13,260
 And we'll just do fresh bits who's editing this ah, oh sweet summer child Matt

123
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,000
 They're getting this raw they're gonna be lucky. You know what this is. It's gonna be on a flash card mailed by a UPS

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,840
 And it's gonna get there in five weeks. They're gonna be like vases loss

125
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:34,380
 Well, I was I was expecting you to say what are you talking about? Matt? I just sent it right that is basically

126
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,800
 Like well, I don't see myself like editing a lot of it I can cut

127
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,780
 That Jack Jacob we need to get you that t-shirt yeah, I don't see myself doing a lot of editing

128
00:10:51,780 --> 00:11:05,000
 I was like, well if we're not editing then I don't think we should do a second take right like cuz we're not gonna

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,920
 We can't edit the takes together and the magic is gonna be lost by the time it gets rather second roll, right? Yeah

130
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,440
 I've watched 20 minutes of stuff instead of 10 minutes of stuff that you know, whatever and so I

131
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,880
 Know like and I was like, I feel like I basically I think this is a bad idea

132
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,280
 You were you were right Matt. You were right. Your instincts

133
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,160
 I was like, we're not really showing them what we can do or whatever and they go. No, they just want a gist of what's going on

134
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,960
 And I was said to Casey I was like

135
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,240
 I've never known any corporate client let alone even production companies

136
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,680
 I've pitched projects to to show a single ounce of imagination when it comes to like what's going on

137
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,040
 Nobody wants the gist of it

138
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:04,920
 The only thing the finished product is the only thing that that kind of video does is let a middle management person say no

139
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,200
 That's exactly I was thinking I was like I was like, that's all I was thinking. I was like, oh gosh

140
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,600
 I might not get to do this gig. That's all it is. That's all that is. That's all that that's all they do is say no

141
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,840
 Because they're so scared to death of taking credit for anything that could go wrong

142
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,440
 right now

143
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,560
 To my cruise credit they this is not their first rodeo with Mercedes, right?

144
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,520
 So they've gone around around with them before so they kind of knew what Mercedes likes. Well, they just simply

145
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,120
 Been like, you know, they've simply presented stuff for Mercedes was skeptical

146
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,760
 And then all sudden it goes off without a hitch and they're and they're and they're happy and thrilled and okay

147
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,560
 So I that's true. The company has some credit with the with the car company. Yeah

148
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,840
 Like for example, this is a multiple times that I was performing a thing called the ski lodge

149
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,660
 I'm sure the first time they said hey, we want to shove a giant ski lodge in the back of your

150
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,960
 Hospitality area they were kind of I'm sure the first thing was like what what?

151
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
 How does that make any sense? I'm sure some eyebrows went up, right?

152
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,560
 And now it's like some people's like favorite part of the whole attraction

153
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,520
 And so now the ski lodge has been getting bigger and bigger with each race and this is like the fourth race

154
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,800
 They've had a ski lodge, right? Very cool. It's gonna be an alpine village by the time the next race, right?

155
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,060
 I hope so. I mean I doubt I'll be a part of it, but I hope so

156
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,540
 It's just gonna be the Winter Olympics happening and an F1 race breaks out

157
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,000
 And

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,480
 So they send off the video and then all of a sudden I get a call is like hey instead of noon to three tomorrow

159
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
 Can you come from 11 to 5?

160
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,240
 Hold on I'm just doing some some quick back of the napkin math here

161
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,980
 And I joke I wrote the video went over that well, huh

162
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:07,700
 Yeah, that did anyone I know the answer to this did anyone acknowledge that maybe we shouldn't have said that video no

163
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,000
 Have notes we have notes no

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,360
 No

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,660
 No one will ever say in any industry. I don't know. Maybe they get it yesterday. I just shouldn't have done it

166
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,840
 but this is where the

167
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,080
 Our team our team leader was super smart. We came in I say for a long time

168
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,680
 And Casey and I brought in stuff to look more professional

169
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:41,440
 And smart smart they said let's do another round but let's bring in everyone from the office and let's do it with it with an

170
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,800
 audience oh

171
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,120
 That's smart. It was smart. It was smart. Oh

172
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,600
 Because your stuff reads with human beings

173
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,960
 Yeah, of course no

174
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,000
 That's exactly how it is. God. It's okay. They just want the gist of it

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's so different. It's honestly. It's why I love how we're doing our recordings now with our live audience

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,960
 It helps me tremendously when I'm doing my bits to see if people give it half a damn about it, right?

177
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,700
 Sometimes they do the answer is no, but

178
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,240
 Once in a while once

179
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:26,760
 Fuck that shit, we all they're all throwing their hands up. Give me the booze

180
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
 This thumbs down the camera

181
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,080
 They're just waiting for you to put on a bikini do shots in a hot tub

182
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,040
 That's like all like all the other twitch broadcasts figured out honestly

183
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,320
 Only fans and just do it. I'd fucking do it. There probably is a market. I don't know

184
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,920
 I've already got something of a user base. Maybe I should look into it

185
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:58,400
 Wait a second Jacob did you just hear that in 20 seconds Paul talked himself into doing an only fans like oh you

186
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,680
 Think I've been thinking about this just today, son

187
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:08,360
 Please you started with I can't do an only fans and then in three senses says I guess I can

188
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:22,560
 There was there was somebody who wanted us to do an only fans and do like a stand-up on

189
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,280
 On only fans. Do you remember that several years ago? I don't wait

190
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,740
 I don't remiss at all someone told us that we should do comedy comedy to us that we should do

191
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,160
 Stand up and improv on our only fans. Oh

192
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,640
 And I think we all had that reaction. I think we all went like, oh, all right

193
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:49,880
 We've already failed to thrive on twitch we might as well add another platform that we tank on we should just do that

194
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,160
 Hey your definition of drive

195
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,600
 Pop the brakes we can get on every platform that is made for something else and do comedy

196
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,200
 Just just us

197
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,960
 Doing doing live performances where people just tell take our clothes off while we do it is the truth is that be really refreshing

198
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
 I've never felt that attraction, you know that that kind of attention before

199
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,040
 It'd be fun Matt take off your pants. Oh, wow, take take them off Matt. It feels good

200
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,660
 Yeah, it's nice and airy. I'm gonna start pantsless Fridays

201
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,840
 I get that I get that I would be I

202
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,120
 Get that it would get old, you know for for any for any of our more attractive listeners out there who?

203
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,960
 Suffer harassment on the regular basis. I'm not trying to belittle your harassment. I understand it

204
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,960
 Maybe we get old it's just never happened to me. So it's a novelty at this

205
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,600
 I think if you open up a channel called bare necessities, I think you'd be a hit and I think

206
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,360
 Be good to go might be a different demographic than you're used to but I think

207
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,780
 Hey ready to grok attention is attention and money is money man. I don't know it sure is I

208
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,280
 Think it would be hard to you know, tell the kids don't come upstairs

209
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,520
 Daddy's doing a bare photo shoot for his only fans like it might be a little tougher to pull off though

210
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,640
 You're right. It would be hard

211
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,880
 Real hard

212
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,600
 Lumberjack in it. That's a great name

213
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,980
 It's not a bad one. Yeah, I was like ML Kennedy. Hey Scoop starts a farmers only profile

214
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,720
 Get my my flannels on here. That's all I need

215
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,800
 Only flannels. How about only flannel?

216
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
 flannels

217
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
 No, that has to already exist, right? Maybe

218
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:44,420
 Only flannels calm, let's see only flannels calm

219
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,520
 The fuck Oh

220
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,560
 Jesus

221
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,600
 Something goes on there. No, that was another twitch channel. I don't know how that came up. Oh weird. That's weird

222
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,760
 Only flannels has a twist channel already

223
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,340
 Only flannels calm seems to be a twitch channel. Okay

224
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,720
 So I guess that's it smart

225
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
 Somebody beat us to it. Yeah, good job

226
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,120
 Or they I'll tell you who else beat us to that

227
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,440
 Lumberjack in it that's sweet sweet lumberjack in it

228
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,560
 Today's show men manly's ice cream social is brought to you by

229
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,680
 Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes. That's from George scoop stanza in

230
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,400
 2024 that's a great scoop name

231
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
 Marcus McGillicuddy's luxury abandoned homes. Oh

232
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,680
 Marcus McGillicuddy. I came over to the United States

233
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,480
 And I move to Florida here in the keys a boat a lot of luxury apartments

234
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,200
 But they've gone unused for years and they're rotting from the inside

235
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,980
 What what that means for you?

236
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:08,200
 Value, that's right. You can get value from my open apartments what nobody's been in for years

237
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,280
 Come on down and get your case a Legionnaires disease from my old peeps

238
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:22,360
 And a bunch of mold. Have you seen those moldy spiders? What are we gotten going on? No, they've seen them

239
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,520
 There's a cryptid spider mold what's taking them over and turning them into looking like we creepy snowflakes

240
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,760
 Well, we got plenty of those don't we?

241
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,600
 Come on over not what I meant to say at the top. I mean it again

242
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,840
 Value

243
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
 You won't stay for a dollar

244
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,720
 You can stay for a dollar and I do not care how long

245
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,520
 That's an indeterminate lease what I'm offering you you give me one dollar

246
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,000
 You can stay in the abandoned place as long as you want

247
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,920
 You understand as long as you want

248
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:06,880
 But you do have to put it with the spiders and the Legionnaires disease and the squatters

249
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,800
 There's already a lot of squatters in me abandoned place

250
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,480
 I shouldn't have never bought it when I saw there was already a squatter in there

251
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,320
 I shouldn't have done it but I did but you know, I didn't pay much

252
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,480
 I paid like 40 grand to this guy and I got like 18 high-rise apartment buildings for 40 grand

253
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,760
 I thought that's pretty good turns out the tax lien on him

254
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,880
 18 million who knew? Well, I've had a done my due diligence

255
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,840
 I would buy dinner. So don't how about you?

256
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,680
 Come and stay and then you know, you can buy him off of me for a dollar

257
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,200
 I'll sell him real cheap now. You do have the tax lien liability when that goes over but

258
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,440
 Who's coming for it? I mean really?

259
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,920
 Nobody

260
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,400
 Nobody's coming to take take it from a McGillicuddy. You can trust me. No one's come to collect from me

261
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,720
 No one wants these old abandoned high-rises

262
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,920
 except for circus folk

263
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:20,040
 Apparently circus folk are real interested in the band and high-rises had I had a wee lad and a fat man come over and say hey

264
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,840
 How about we take your place for circus use? I said, I don't know

265
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 Well, you the big guy and he says yeah, I'm the fat man in the circus and the little guy says yeah

266
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,000
 I'm the little guy in the circus and then sure enough they had a giraffe with them, too

267
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,160
 And a monkey and a lady who could dance on a zebra's back. I

268
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,760
 Couldn't believe it and she said I'd kind of do anything but dance on a zebra's back

269
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
 I can't dance on regular surfaces because they're too flat

270
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,360
 I require the spine of a zebra to impact my feet in order to enable my dancing

271
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
 I thought that's strange in it. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense

272
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,080
 Turns out they weren't circus people at all. They were aliens

273
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,360
 So these high-rise apartments are very

274
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,840
 Nice looking to the aliens who are coming to take us over

275
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,720
 I should have known from the one day who was real big and fat and a little guy this little guy crawled in him

276
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,480
 Like later on they crawled inside of him. Yeah, I should have known there's something fish something alien going on about that

277
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,800
 I should ask I'm the lady who dances on zebras

278
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,480
 She didn't have a zebra

279
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,520
 You know, hey, she didn't have a zebra. They did have a giraffe though

280
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,560
 At least that's what they told me it was could have been a stretched out dog

281
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,560
 I'm not hundred percent. I

282
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,640
 Don't know anyway, come on Bay

283
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:57,480
 Try out my houses what are rotten from the inside? They're not good. I'm tired of selling the alien circus people

284
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,560
 And her hey scoops to check out. Yeah, that was a that was a good take one

285
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,080
 Let's let's go back to one do it again. I went from the top everybody here you go

286
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:13,320
 McGillicuddy and action luxury abandoned homes. Hello. I'm Matt McGillicuddy

287
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,560
 Selling luxury abandoned homes in it. Yeah. Look I tell you what

288
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,960
 These homes are luxury and abandoned because they're overrun with mice

289
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,560
 That's just the truth

290
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
 Cut right to it. It's all mice

291
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,720
 It or hey scoops a check. No, here's the thing

292
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,760
 Not like you think it's old stuff from fries electronics

293
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,520
 It's actual wired mice

294
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,480
 From stem to staring

295
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,280
 You can't swing a cat in here and not hit a wired mouse. Please don't

296
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,300
 Don't swing a cat. Yes

297
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
 Damn it

298
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 Cuz he hit a wire mouse

299
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,360
 Wait Wayne says send that to Mercedes and we will

300
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,840
 I've already said it it's been sent. What's this loss?

301
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,160
 We had a giant

302
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,040
 Concert on the stage in my backyard last night. Wait, what?

303
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,360
 SJ is putting together. I'll put it. I'll put the picture up here on zoom and switch. SJ is putting together a new band

304
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
 And so we needed

305
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,440
 rehearsal

306
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
 No, we needed video

307
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,400
 Why we outfitted the stage in the backyard? When did I have trust now? When did you get I have trust?

308
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,880
 this week

309
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,960
 Now how is that fixed? Oh

310
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,040
 It's it's clamped on right now

311
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,760
 it's there's trust clamped on to the on the stage and there's curtain hanging from the truss and lights on the truss and

312
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,280
 Are you looking to make it permanent or is it gonna just be no, no, that's all it's all that's all down already. Okay

313
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:07,880
 Yeah, no beautiful stage in his backyard, which which the pint of plane trio used for a scoop fest the inaugural performance was

314
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,960
 Pike that's right. Did you have the only ones that have signed the stage? I was gonna say

315
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,800
 The new band will have to sign the stage

316
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,260
 We haven't named to the new band yet is as yet unnamed band

317
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,240
 What's the criteria? Nope? Nope?

318
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,600
 What do you mean it's a what it's like it's mainly a corporate band it's

319
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,680
 name that

320
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,520
 Now alright, so so it looks like it looks like general rock is that what I'm saying general rock. Yeah, it's a military band

321
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,560
 general rock

322
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,680
 There it is. Oh my god. Would that what you say a military band general? Oh my god general rock

323
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,640
 Four-star general rock four-star general rock. I

324
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,700
 Don't know what I'm allowed to say about the band. I didn't I didn't discuss

325
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,880
 press with that

326
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,360
 Good point, but uh, but yeah, no, it's a they're there. The plan is to tour around

327
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:11,120
 Probably this coming summer and get a get a lot of dates just all over the all over the United States

328
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,480
 How about pussy bucket? I feel like that'd be a good corporate

329
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,200
 Ah

330
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,840
 That is one that is on the board already. It's it's high up there

331
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,160
 It's not number one, but it is it's pretty high up there. I'm on the side between cock magnet and cock and balls magnet

332
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,140
 Do do duo front people, okay

333
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:41,440
 Yeah, yeah, that's good that's the name of the band lady song or man song

334
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 You pick

335
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,040
 Butch and bitch present

336
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:55,240
 General rock general rock is not bad what to have

337
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:04,200
 Who would the the two do it to shoot out and Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde? Yeah solid solid like

338
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,280
 Yeah, also they were killed in Louisiana, so there's the there's the tie-in

339
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,720
 When people are like, why is your name Bonnie and Clyde? We're like, no, no, it's okay

340
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,960
 Bonnie and Clyde were actually killed in Louisiana, which is where Jacob is from who's Jacob?

341
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,480
 He doesn't have anything to do with this band. It's just a guy that we know

342
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,080
 Boney and slide, there we go

343
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,440
 A name and then like a thing. Yeah, like a hootie in the blowfish

344
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,800
 Yeah, I wouldn't I I'm not even being coy about it

345
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,400
 I would tell you the names that we've already come up with for the band

346
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,720
 But I can't think of a single one right now. All right. Well, you've already got SJ in the ruckus

347
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,680
 So SJ is not gonna front another band with SJ in it

348
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,220
 Right, uh, probably not. Yeah, probably not that be saying the commotion. Yeah, that'd be some more

349
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,840
 Sarah Jessica and the commotion there. Thank you

350
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:14,400
 But yeah, so that was a lot of fun and now I have a whole lot of truss that is the trust that was in

351
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,560
 That picture is a little bit of the trust that we have

352
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,080
 I got a whole lot of trust y'all

353
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,520
 What I have is I have a way for us to not have to rent pipe and drape for next scoop fest

354
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,160
 That's how much trust. Oh, that's awesome. How about this? Yeah sweet bean and the fever machines

355
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
 Sweet bean

356
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,960
 It's amazing that you say that that's already number one on the list sweet bean and the fever machines sweet

357
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,800
 We all came up with that one

358
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,680
 Yeah, that was basically everybody went away and brainstormed and all of us came back with sweet bean and the fever machine

359
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,000
 Right there at the top of our list

360
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:04,600
 I'm sweet bean. This is the fever machine. So say thank you for having us. Oh my god. Can you imagine if SJ got to be sweet?

361
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 Bean. Oh

362
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,320
 All every time it's time for her to sing a song the other lead singer guy goes take it bean

363
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:28,960
 When I just picture money just showering yeah, yeah so much money coming in I just got hit in the head by a quarter

364
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,600
 How about coitus interruptus

365
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,840
 When they decide they want to be like a corporate band is

366
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,220
 Is there already a demand for corporate bands or is that a market that they want to try to crack?

367
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,480
 No, no, this is this is something that SJ and one of her agents came up with this. This is a thought for that

368
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,900
 It I'm saying corporate. It's really more like like city and city events

369
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,600
 That kind of like when cities hire bands, you know play the riverfront. Yeah

370
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,000
 Party, it's that it's that type of thing. Yeah

371
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:15,160
 Yeah, so let corporates the wrong word. I got it. I got it city and county events type thing Chris Bill and the exact change

372
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
 Oh

373
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,920
 Puts it right out there. We're in this with the dough

374
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,760
 Yeah, it gives a very professional

375
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,600
 Oh Wayne does not like Chris building exact change

376
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,880
 You get the thumbs down from waiting on that one

377
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,920
 I think Chris building the exact change might have legs, but we'll see. All right. All right, that one's out

378
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,960
 All right, how about a bean bean counter and the accountants? There you go

379
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,360
 You got that going on and then you can get your sweet bean take it bean back in

380
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,560
 And then you could do the the Dolly Parton typing song

381
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,360
 These are the account staking account

382
00:31:52,360 --> 00:32:02,520
 Yeah, I'm also in the same market that's why I didn't know how much I would be competing with SJ

383
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,640
 But I'm doing an all tap dance cover band

384
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,440
 So everything every song we play is through the through the toes and heels to the balls over even heels of a tap shoe

385
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,680
 Interesting interesting. How about the Louisiana moon dogs?

386
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:25,360
 Paul's really trying which is weird. Are they based out of are they based out of Louisiana? No

387
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:33,520
 All right, Alabama moon dogs and one of them is based out of LA Oh the LA moon dogs

388
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,280
 Here's we got moon dogs location TBA

389
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,220
 Okay, that's the last percent of the way there the last moon dogs

390
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:56,280
 I'm trying to think of like if it isn't even like, okay

391
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:02,280
 What's in the realm of possibility Paul says a combination of words that make you go to SJ and say a single thing?

392
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:10,300
 What the barrier of entry of like you actually go in that state with an idea I

393
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,520
 Don't know I do know that I have not stood up or written anything down

394
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:24,080
 Like she's home right she's here she's in the building with me right now

395
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,640
 Thousand Paul and a thousand typewriters

396
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,840
 Speaking of tap dancing I saw

397
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,000
 Matt's grandmother-in-law

398
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,640

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:58,760
 It's mostly moving a bunch of moving in about

428
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
 Oh

429
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:11,040
 Well, the barn was on fire and so were my pants I was getting to the barn to do the sex dance

430
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,160
 By sex dance, I mean putting my wiener in it. Oh, yeah

431
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,000
 The cow was there and began to grin it

432
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,160
 Yeah, I did the wiener dance right there with the cow

433
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,680
 Like I said before it's me putting it down the others got in the way for about a minute

434
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,700
 But then I slid to my side and I went ahead and did it

435
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,480
 Yeah, and I got the weird cow aides from fucking the cow the weird

436
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,000

 Closely we're about to get back on the tour bus my face player and I my human face player

441
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:36,480
 Cover story for bestiality

442
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:46,480
 Buggery that's uttered in the puritan times. It was called buggery. If you were fucking an animal, is that right?

443
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,600
 Yeah, so this is on a Jane Borden, you know, she puts out all these little shorts now author cults like us

444
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
 We've had her on the show. Yes

445
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:02,560
 Buggery is so when people were so upset that someone might have sex outside of wedlock

446
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,440
 some people

447
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,600
 Took fucking animals as a workaround

448
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:18,200
 I'm not having, you know pre-marital sex with a human. Sure. I can fuck this animal and so they made that a crime, too

449
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,400
 Okay. Oh

450
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,520
 Wow, yeah buggery was the name of it though bestiality all of it. Yeah. Oh boy

451
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:37,980
 Really want to fuck something beside your wife I was talking to the pig

452
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,500
 Now wait so now out of work that these people are going to who does not fuck this house so the band is mostly rock-and-roll

453
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,040
 Yeah

454
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,320
 So we're good. We're back to that. We're back to the day. So we don't want like

455
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,880
 Fucking animals to go back to this. We don't want country music type names. We want to rock and roll

456
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,580
 like Starship or something like that

457
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:13,800
 Flicky yeah flicky being in the buggery wake up SJ. Let's go look like we've had deaf leopards

458
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,760
 So let's do another human malady mixed with a rare exotic animal

459
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,840
 Let's just try that combo and see what okay

460
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,200
 All right

461
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,760
 So like like high cholesterol rabbit

462
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,520
 High cholesterol rabbit. That's a great band name. How about how about crippled Jaguar?

463
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,840
 Huh, I mean Jaguar can be crippled already

464
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:49,280
 Blind melon. Oh wait. Oh shit. I need an animal. I know I just named an actual I did blind in an actual band name

465
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,480
 That's what I did. Yeah, that's the joke I went for

466
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,880
 About

467
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,000
 Eczema koala

468
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,920
 Fierce enough animal

469
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,000
 Rabbit disease marsupial. Yeah, welcome to the stage

470
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
 Monica copy bear. Oh

471
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:19,440
 Oh, oh, oh it's gotta be um, oh shit now

472
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,800
 I need a good one a real good real good. Ladies and gentlemen a whale with cataracts

473
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,500
 That's actually kind of good cataract whale

474
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,900
 Cataract whale cataract whale. I'm just wailing along. Hey

475
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
 Vertical walrus and the penguin knees

476
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:49,320
 Let's welcome this syphilis koala

477
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:58,320
 That'd be great because the Muslim chlamydia so they've got a different disease in the mix I like it oh

478
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,080
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, they those koalas fuck a

479
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,560
 Goraphobic honey badger

480
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
 Mildly depressed kangaroo

481
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,700
 We're secretly just doing Spanish job song suggestions. We are that's all we're doing. That's all we're doing

482
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,760
 But yeah, I think I think don't worry. I've written all these down

483
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,000
 I have sent them I have sent them to Mercedes already. They're gonna get back to us

484
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,840
 It's gonna be great tomorrow. I'm gonna go to see

485
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,720
 the new wicked wicked for

486
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,480
 Wicked good good wicked for good

487
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,820
 I'm excited about it. I'm hearing all kinds of things out there ups and downs

488
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:51,040
 Some people are really critical of it. Some people are really like leaving the theaters crying. We're going multiple times. I

489
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,280
 Think it's hard to have a sequel to a movie like that

490
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,080
 Yes, and they and they shot it simultaneously as well, right and

491
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,440
 The and you you lose all the credit you got from the first one where you created these worlds

492
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,760
 You can't believe what you're looking at, right? Right. It's such a good job creating that world

493
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,320
 Now you go making you like, you know what everything looks like and you're kind of like, okay, cool. And also

494
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,200
 This happened with Kill Bill. Ah

495
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,840
 When you have an awesome movie and you don't have to stick the landing but just leave a cliffhanger and people can leave a theater

496
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
 satisfied with a cliffhanger. Oh

497
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,880
 That's really that's that's a lot easier to do. That's a lot easier. I mean ask a TV writer

498
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,800
 If it's easier to write a season finale or a series finale

499
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:43,240
 Right, right, right, right. Exactly. That's a that's a very valid point. Have you guys watched smiling friends?

500
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:51,800
 Smiling friends. No smiling friends brilliant animated series. I highly recommend it. It's absolutely my kind of humor. It's fucking hilarious

501
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,760
 But they go in every season. They just got renewed renewed up to season 5

502
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
 Renewed up to season 5

503
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,640
 But they approach every season their last episode as though if this is it then this is it

504
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,760
 They make it so that it could be the end. So they've taken that approach Matt from the jump like that's pretty smart

505
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,800
 Yeah, I find it's weird a series

506
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,480
 that does does this bizarrely is

507
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,760
 Slow horses. You guys watching these slow horses on Apple. Yeah, watch a little name great. Gary. Oh my great

508
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,080
 great band name

509
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,000
 They always end it like

510
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,200
 Satisfactorily like if that was the last joke you would and then they run a preview for next season

511
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,280
 Which I find fascinating because I can't imagine they're always renewed but they run a preview of the next season

512
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:50,120
 At the very end of the montage and I'm always like why how the hell do you do that? That's impossible

513
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,760
 I mean, I guess they I guess they put that together and run it

514
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:02,320
 Until Apple says you're not renewed and then Apple just takes it takes that part out. Maybe maybe yeah

515
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,200
 And also, how do you shoot that? How do you already have it? Yeah, how do you right?

516
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,720
 That's the bigger question is where did this footage come from? I find it bizarre

517
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,080
 Okay, Jacob chase the blaze

518
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,480
 Yes, there you go, that's the one that's the one chase that's the one

519
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:30,520
 It's for people who want to have sex with people with STDs. Chase the blaze. Oh my god a bug chaser

520
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,440
 Bunch has chained the bug chasers bugger chasers

521
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:45,120
 Buggery buggery pittery. I only want to have sex with people who've had sex with animals previously. Oh my god

522
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,800
 Well, that's the now Matt. You've ruined it. That's the opening song

523
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:56,280
 People and vice versa how about

524
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:09,720
 You're supposed to play bass not sing

525
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
 You idiot utter embarrassment

526
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,960
 Stupid cow. I mean human. Oh

527
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,780
 And I'm married to stupid human I'm married to get on the bus I

528
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,360
 Know I'm sorry. I had to cut your your hooves to look like hands

529
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,100
 Terribly painful for you, but I love you so much

530
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,600
 The only way she could play bass

531
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,120
 Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

532
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,000
 Oh

533
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,780
 That is music to my ears music to my ears. If only it was a country band. We'd have this thing solved

534
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,360
 Man I was where was that? Oh, well, I was doing a week of shows in San Antonio

535
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,600
 Mainstream country music is so stupid

536
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,360
 Hold on this is breaking news mainstream country music is stupid. There are country songs that are amazing. They're country artists are amazing. Absolutely

537
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,960
 but the but the

538
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,800
 It's just pop with a

539
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,700
 Wawa pedal and they literally it's like I'm literally go like really every song has a drink in a truck in it

540
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,320
 Every song has a whiskey and and the truck in it like all of them

541
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:40,960
 Just makes me I basically I get so I'm sitting there drinking like coffee like a San Antonio coffee shop being like who can't write this

542
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
 Like who like anyone can write these?

543
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:50,200
 This is not surprising now Matt some of them have a wife at home who is not happy

544
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:57,280
 Some of them wish they just could have done better if a couple other choices this has gone differently

545
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,380
 Well, you know, there's some shit going on when the AI is beating them all

546
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,800
 Yeah, but that's been a problem with all genres, but yes

547
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,260
 Yeah, and I don't know how the hell you fix it, but Spotify is being hijacked by AI bands

548
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
 Yeah

549
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,000
 And these AI and these and these people people sitting around with AI are just making a bunch of money off of plays

550
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,800
 Instead of actual bands I was just talking to a friend the other day he was you saying that

551
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,920
 Doctoral what's the thing that you that you have to write to?

552
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,200
 PhD you don't use this a face. Yeah. Yeah, yeah doctoral thesis

553
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,720
 Betty stop guessing

554
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
 the door, but

555
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,920
 Stop guessing Betty

556
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,760
 Yeah dissertation. Yeah, that kind of thing. He's ready dissertation

557
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:55,400
 he's got it all written out and gave it to his you know faculty advisor person and

558
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:03,640
 Was kind of accused of using AI yeah to to write it. Mm-hmm

559
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,800
 and

560
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,620
 Basically the the professor said you either used AI to write this

561
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,960
 or

562
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,200
 You wrote this and it feels like AI either way. You need to rewrite this

563
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,640
 Is go fuck yourself

564
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:29,320
 But the the the professor was trying to be helpful because he was like no I did write this

565
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,440
 You know, I didn't I didn't use AI to do this

566
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,360
 I'm getting my PhD and this is this is what I want to be doing like I'm doing this because I because I want

567
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:41,760
 Want to do it. Yep. So no, I didn't have AI write this and the professor was basically like yeah

568
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,520
 But when the when the committee looks at this if they feel like it it feels AI

569
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,160
 Then then they're gonna hold that

570
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:58,320
 That's my favorite song shut up Betty get on the bus, I'm gonna cut your hooves again

571
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,560
 Finger up your hooves. I don't see Oh McDonald on the set list. No Betty. We can't play that song

572
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,920
 Oh, you're such a talkie cow Betty. I

573
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,960
 Mean person definitely a person person

574
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,840
 But yeah, they were like, oh, yeah, I had to rewrite my whole my whole thing or like a couple of chapters in it

575
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:26,200
 Or something. I don't know but it had to rewrite a sizable portion of it because it felt like AI

576
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:33,120
 It is like this is this is such a weird time that we're in right now because we haven't figured that part out yet

577
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,560
 No, and honestly, we're in that weird pocket in history where it's just a pain in the ass right now

578
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,040
 Yeah, and college professors are using AI to ask whether or not something is written by AI

579
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,160
 so they're doing it too and

580
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,440
 Some some college person are using AI to read people's fucking shit and and grade it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh

581
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,580
 Yeah, no, it's just it's just like the

582
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,540
 Thing anytime technology happens. It takes us a while to catch up to it

583
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:04,640
 I will tell you what's weird and almost like why we think AI is fascinating. Is that I think AI can be wrong and

584
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:11,280
 I think definitely so a bunch of lawyers recently got like sanctioned. I think whatever it's called or sees us

585
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,200
 cease-and-desist

586
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,040
 Killed no murdered. No, no, but they

587
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,000
 basically

588
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,240
 Had AI write their legal documents and had false sources

589
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,760
 Yeah cases whatever and then so we were putting together our quizzes for

590
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,240
 F1 we put together breakdowns of each rate of each driver

591
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,220
 And there wasn't a lot but there were three

592
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:45,960
 Errors three lines. Ah, and so if one of them was like, can we go over all of your material before you do it?

593
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,600
 I'm sorry Mercedes. We didn't know they were gonna send that video to you and it made up dumb stuff like they had pets

594
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,880
 They didn't have or right fears. They didn't have

595
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,060
 You can while you're working on on the AI stuff. There are times that you can

596
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,760
 That you should go in and just be like double double check all of that stuff

597
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,480
 You just told me is all of that actually correct or did you make up some of that and sometimes don't be it'll be like

598
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
 No, I made all of that up

599
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,640
 It'll just tell you. Yeah, right if you don't think to ask then you don't know that's really weird though

600
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,160
 I guess it is I asked for a list

601
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,320
 I was like, what are words have never been used in word. Oh, because I want to like see if I can get a word

602
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,320
 Oh and one if I can commit to a word

603
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,800
 okay, yeah, and

604
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:40,260
 It gave me a list and the list was completely wrong. I fact-checked it and it was just like no

605
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,960
 It just gave me a bunch of random five-letter words and said it checked two archives and it was just lying

606
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,840
 And I'm back in the eighties and nineties

607
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,100
 You'd get on and or you'd find an ad or something and you'd hire just like a college student

608
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:02,360
 We write a paper for you or in high school or something. I was asking if Paul's writing down band names. Yeah, I am

609
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,000
 fire listen

610
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,940
 And he drew a logo, yeah, I don't think you can go wrong with fire lizard I

611
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,640
 Surely not

612
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,840
 Finest it shirts me Paul if you're drawing my kid needs a name for his three at the and he's a logo for his three

613
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,840
 on three soccer team I

614
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,120
 Have I have I have

615
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,400
 My brother jingle ballers the jingle ballers jingle ballers

616
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:37,120
 So they're like my holiday themed. Yes. It's a holiday theme three on three. It's great people dress up for it

617
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,160
 Like it's a really silly. It's a really silly three on three soccer tournament

618
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,740
 Kids are there gonna be pictures of your kids in Santa costumes playing soccer

619
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,720
 There's gonna be a picture of their coaches in the Santa costume because I am their coach

620
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,320
 Yeah, I'll get my tablet in a minute and I'll draw one up. I just did the artwork for this

621
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:04,580
 For this month, it's coming out. Oh, yeah, so I'll get my tablet and draw up a possible logo

622
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,540
 I have already tasked Rob with it too. So you're

623
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,140
 If it comes in second, that's fine. Okay. Okay, that's what you got. You got a competition. Yeah

624
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,240
 III

625
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,600
 Yeah, cuz basically like my son's youngest

626
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,440
 His soccer team was a disaster this year

627
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,300
 Okay, a couple kids got injured a couple kids quit

628
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,000
 Some kids would just not show up. They regularly played without like enough kids

629
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,640
 Like one kid down my kid would play the entire game. It was a brutal brutal season

630
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,220
 So when the three on three came up, I was like, oh

631
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:47,160
 Let's get the five kids who showed up all the time who had and let's put them in a in a three on three together

632
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,440
 Yeah, have them play

633
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,380
 One one one one a proper finish to their season instead of just constantly getting clobbered by other teams

634
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,380
 The five gives you a pair of subs. Is that is that what? Yeah. Yeah, you have up to six and you saw

635
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,480
 You sub like crazy and three on three

636
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:09,960
 Okay, and so I was like, let's do it and then the coach who had finished his last evening coached like seven seasons

637
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,800
 Was like I'm not coaching again. So I said I imagine you don't want to come out of retirement and he goes no

638
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,840
 I do not I said, okay, I said I will coach this team. I'm gonna tell the parents

639
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,360
 I have no business coaching this team, but I will coach this three on three team. That's nice, but I'll do it

640
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,360
 That's really good of you, man. Yeah. Yeah

641
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:32,080
 So yeah jingle ballers jingle ballers. That's a I didn't want this to become a democracy

642
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,200
 So I simply said hey, do you want to play Hilly wants to play a three on three tournament?

643
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,160
 Do you want to join him?

644
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,360
 He's named the team the jingle ballers because I didn't want anyone saying anything else. I was like it's not up for debate

645
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:50,320
 There's no conversation. It is the jingle ballers. That is that has happened. He was debating that and the snow devils

646
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,040
 Snow devils much easier to logo

647
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,400
 Jingle ballers will be fun jingle ballers is funnier. How far can we go on the?

648
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 innuendo scale

649
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,120
 The the Tina one last year they were just called the hard penises and they had a big giant cock

650
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:16,960
 Lots of veins. Yeah, but the the the testicles were soccer balls. That was what made it a soccer

651
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,040
 Thing jingle ballers. That's what I'm thinking already. I'm like

652
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:26,200
 Well, they showed up to the game in an Oscar Meyer wiener mobile that they had repurposed into just a giant penis

653
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,800
 They painted they painted they just all you got to do is paint veins on it

654
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:42,680
 Just like that boom becomes the cock mobile just dragging to Christmas ornaments for balls behind it like like they just got married

655
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:50,280
 When I say hard you say penis is hard

656
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,040
 So, yeah, I guess

657
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,600
 They're ten. So use your best discretion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I got you. I got you. They're ten

658
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,320
 So they've only seen ten years worth of internet pornography

659
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,840
 Just right keep that in mind, man

660
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,680
 I just I think about this every once in a while and I do think about that

661
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:17,840
 I thought about it too when when I accidentally gave Matt's kid a comic that might have a boob in it

662
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:25,240
 But it was a circle in a circle. I like that that's moved accidentally now it I mean it was accidentally

663
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
 Also, I don't care but also

664
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,400
 but also

665
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:37,720
 If I were a child man, I've got a box of hustlers for your kids if I were me at that age

666
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,920
 Cuz I remember the kind of bullshit links. I went to to see pornography at 11

667
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,600
 We had to go to the woods or somebody's house with a weird older brother

668
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,520
 You know or whatever we also watched

669
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,720
 in a group

670
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,400
 Absolutely, right, which is absolutely weird when you think about it or yes weird now

671
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,560
 But like, you know, can you imagine a bunch of guys like gathered around now to watch internet porn around a computer?

672
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:11,520
 It's it's a different feeling. It isn't I imagine it. Yes, but there's no way kids of this day and age avoid porn

673
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,440
 You can't turn on a computer. It's it just it's in your face. I think about this like what like because like all our

674
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,640
 Our TV apps right have different profiles and the kids have kids profiles, right?

675
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,200
 Yeah, and then the kids but the kids know my password to get to my of course file

676
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:34,220
 Right to get to the unrestricted and then I'm like, oh maybe I should change that or do something about that

677
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,200
 Then I'm like the least of my concern is them finding stuff on like HBO

678
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,000
 Right, like right when they have access to shit. They saw Daenerys's tits

679
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 They got on them on the max app and looked up old episodes of the Red Shoe Diaries, oh

680
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,760
 That's the thing real sex Red Shoe Diaries. Those are all gone

681
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,240
 Those up anymore, right

682
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,600
 Now the question is like so because right now they say it's basically a huge problem is that kids

683
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:11,360
 See so much porn before they actually have sex themselves. They get desensitized and weirded out by it. No, they feel

684
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:19,160
 They feel well, yes, but they they feel also pressure to imitate it or that they they want to do like

685
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,720
 Porn sex constantly. Yes, right

686
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,660
 Like the first time you know when they're losing their virginity. They're like when should I spit into your asshole, right?

687
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,440
 Yeah

688
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,680
 Do we do we gape now or gape later? Yeah

689
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,600
 Like that was my first question. There it is

690
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:44,240
 President Cooper star that's exactly what I came up with. Oh, that's scrambled porn. It was exactly my life

691
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:53,080
 That was absolutely my oh man scrambled scrambled TV porn scrambled TV. Porn is a great name for SJ's band and

692
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,480
 It is a good name

693
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:03,440
 Yeah, but basically they're trying to do all this crazy stuff and not enjoying it yeah, yeah

694
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,580
 That sucks. That sucks. Yeah

695
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:13,160
 But most people most the good thing about that is I have to have a speech and I'm gonna have to have a speech

696
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,880
 they're skipping from age 17 to age 48 and

697
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,160
 That's because that's the time when you kind of enjoy sex and after that. It's just like

698
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:30,960
 47 so it's like oh, I didn't realize I was a fucking cuss

699
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,560
 Yeah, you're knocking on his door

700
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:41,960
 I'll tell you who else is aging where is edging while they age

701
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,760
 That's the following sponsor edging while you age edging while you age

702
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,480
 Hold on. I was I lost the commercials. I was looking up buggery

 Australian ICS city is Adelaide. So I'll go with that. I'll go with number three Adelaide. It is Adelaide. Nice guess

758
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,520

 Might be a cunt, but I'm not not a fucking cunt

01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:32,320
 Been caught wanking a hard-earned thirst needs a big cold beer, but I drink to get pissed and

763
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,000
 Greg the stop sign

764
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:42,640
 This is a great question, I like a song called Greg the stop sign a lot

765
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,440

 WWW.TISM.WANKER.COM

769
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:05,840
 The big I think I think hard-earned thirst needs a big cold beer, but I drink to get pissed. That's the opener

770
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
 That's the that's the number one track

771
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,280
 It's not the money spot, but it is on the single spot, but it's the it's a hard-earned opener there

772
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,760
 I

773
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,400
 Might be a cunt, but I'm not a fucking cunt. I feel like that was on their earlier album

774
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,100

776
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,360

777
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:38,800

778
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
 No, we can have our own here. It's true

779
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,280

 Matt my guess is Ron Hitler Barassi

790
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,320
 Let's try it

791
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,400
 I'm sorry. It's a little bit. Damn. It's let me the rob lice

792
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:29,520
 That means Ron Hitler Barassi is wide open. We can take out a chance. We could take it

793
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,280
 Paul

 Well done boom good job Paul

01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,320
 Hey, yeah, we actually have an Aussie guest in our next episode

801
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,400
 We should maybe we could have saved this for them

802
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,400
 Although too bad Wayne Geo's in chat saying he doesn't he hasn't heard of any of these and he's he lives there

803
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,400
 So there you go. Well, there you go

01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,960
 I'll go with random Aussie music for 200

807
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:32,920
 Which 1970s famous rock band just finished another tour of Australia as of November 20 25. Oh

808
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,240
 This is easy. This is only so many 70s rock bands

809
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,080
 It's got to be the who are the stones

810
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,740
 Those two famous Australian rock bands the who and the Rolling Stone

811
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:51,280
 They're Australian aren't they? No, I think Paul's right. I think I think it's not I think it's a 70s rock band from here

812
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,280
 Just fished on the tour of Australia. Oh

813
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,200
 But because I'm confused I'll pass

814
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:02,560
 That passes to me. I was just gonna say that the old Aka Daka the old AC DC. Oh, that's probably right

815
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,320
 I'm going with that. It's AC DC. Yeah, he was right. It was an Aussie band

816
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,120
 Aussie band touring Aussie

817
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,440
 I'll try the beards for 400

 Johan beer driven or Tom beard man

822
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:32,540
 Tom beard man is not real all those others are fantastic. I think it's Tom beard man

823
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,880
 It's Tom beard man. Wow

824
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,240
 Wow

825
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,320
 My answer was right. My logic was not Paul. I'll close out the tism

826
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,200
 For 800 tism is an acronym for what?

827
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:57,160
 This is a great question. This is stupid music. This is serious mum. This is so melodramatic

828
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,680
 This isn't super meaningful

829
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,240
 who

830
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:07,000
 I'm torn between one and four

831
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:14,320
 Okay, so you're between this is stupid music or this isn't super meaningful. I'll go with four

832
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,560
 All right. This isn't super meaningful is

833
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:25,000
 Incorrect. Oh both of yours. We're all you this is serious mum. It's a serious mum. You were barking up the wrong tree

834
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,600
 Matt

835
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,920

 No, you're no, I'm passing to

842
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,400

843
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,120
 Four. All right. It's two

844
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,360
 It's me I'll try random. I was so close you were you were just a couple off

845
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:20,040
 The song Eagle Rock by daddy cool was the inspiration for which Elton John hit

846
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:25,220
 Gotta be crocodile rock. I could be gotta be crocodile rock. Yeah, I'll say crocodile rock

854

01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,600
 Those are all within a range

865
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:14,480
 They're so close just in case you're vaguely familiar exactly I was thinking it's like 11 year window

 I'm pretty sure this is five. I think I think I listened to five different King gizzard and the lizard wizard albums in

882
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,560
 2017 sounds right to me

883
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,880
 It's fine

884
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,640
 My guesses are going well today Paul

885
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:46,720
 Butterfingers for 800 in

889
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:07,380
 I'm gonna get the yo mama after breakfast

890
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:13,740
 Nope on the top of that. Well, she's on top of the list. Holy shit breakfast right before breakfast. Oh

891
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,560
 It's the most important meal of the day

892
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,420
 Take cover everybody

893
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:28,320
 Got the beards for 600 or 800. I don't care. You get the $800 when correct

894
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,720
 No, you will still be in second. I don't care. I don't care Jacob. Just pick one

895
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:38,680
 Which of these beards hits did not get a single if your dad doesn't have a beard. You've got two

896
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:46,680
 All the bearded ladies, I'm growing a beard downstairs for Christmas

897
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,960
 I'm growing a beard downstairs for Christmas and you should consider having sex with a bearded man

898
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,120
 Which of those did not get a single Matt? These are really funny

899
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,640
 pass

900
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,640
 All that passes to me

901
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:13,480
 Sadly sadly you should consider having sex with a bearded man did not get a single so that is that is the answer. Let's see

902
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:17,840
 If your dad doesn't have a beard, you've got two moms

903
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,480
 Perfect

904
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,480
 And I'm closing out the category

905
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,280
 for 800 in 2009 the beards traveled to

906
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:33,720

 championships France Alaska Austria or Germany

908
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:43,760
 Okay, I'm gonna take Alaska out of the running sorry Alaska

909
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:49,640
 It is cold it's also a state and not a country in the other three or country each

910
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,660
 Oh, yeah, I must say Austria. I feel like Austria

911
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:57,640
 Would have some fascinating mustaches and beards

912
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,640
 Nope, it's Alaska. Oh, I

913
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,440
 Was exactly wrong. That is the game

01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,080
 Used to used to be able you used to have to call

924
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,840
 Someone's parents before you spoke to them when you were man. That was exact. I was just thinking about that the other day

925
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:07,360
 I think about that today thinking about how I called a girl to ask her out to prom and I had talked to her mom and dad

926
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,360
 I was like, what the fuck is my wife?

927
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,800
 And she said no

928
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,960
 Did you did you fuck the mom and dad?

929
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,600
 well, I asked the mom if she wanted to go to prom instead and she said I

930
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,960
 Don't want to go to prom, but I will take you to the motel

931
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,060
 Hotel holiday in yeah

932
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:31,660
 Moveover. Oh god, you're a cow ladies

933
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:36,800
 But but but people aren't taught how to start a decent conversation

934
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,840
 So they say just rude shit

935
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,160
 All the time on these on these websites

936
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,760
