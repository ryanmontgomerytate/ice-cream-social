00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an Ice Cream Social?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Yeah, I'd love to!

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Great, let's go!

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hey Scoops.com, right there there is Scoopfest Swag!

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Over there at HeyScoops.com from this last Scoop Profession.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 The beds, you can get the roads, you can get the t-shirts! HeyScoops.com, Scoopfest Swag!

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social!

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Sitting at C, it's Matt Donnelly!

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Sitting at Pittsburgh, it's Paul Mattingly!

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Sitting at Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy!

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 We're PreachingFun!

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Hey guys!

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Hey, by the time you hear this, tomorrow night, Friday night, I'm playing Sparta, New Jersey, two shows, Sparta Avenue Stage.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 7pm is sold out, but my 9 o'clock is not.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So if you can be anywhere near Sparta, New Jersey, or know anyone near Sparta, New Jersey, tell them to come on out for a really fun show at 9 o'clock in Sparta, it'll be awesome.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Where do they get tickets?

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 If you look up Sparta Avenue Stage, you'll find it there, or it's in the link of my MyNoodlerBio on Instagram, you can find the link there.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Oh, and just to confirm, if they can't come, but they still want to buy tickets, they can do that too, right?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Yes, if you love the performance art of buying tickets and not showing up, go for it.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Also, Paul and I, our shows are starting to sell pretty well here, but we're--

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Yeah, fuck yeah! Let's go!

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We'll open Tierney's Tavern, a lot of scoops are coming out.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I know, which is fantastic!

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It's going to be another good scoop gathering October 23rd, that's for sale on our website, that's at heyscoops.com/comedynight.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Tickets are 20 bucks.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Yeah, and we've definitely moved a few tickets for that, that is going to be a nice little scoop event.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 It's a steal, get yourselves out there if you're in that tri-state area, make the magic happen, you won't regret it.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Tierney's in and of itself is an experience.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 That's true.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Are we going to be up in the upstairs again?

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Yeah, we're going to be up in the upstairs.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Oh my fucking God, that spot is just--

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Get you a can smashed burger!

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 It's going to be good, good times, baby.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 In the old days, when our improv group was in the Twilight phase of our improv group, we kind of would just throw shows together up at Tierney's and we would just do sets.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 We would just do a set and stop, have some drinks, hang out, then go like, "Ah, let's do another set," and we would kind of get up.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I'm kind of envisioning something as fun and kind of casual as that.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Oh my God, I can't wait, dude.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Kurt's coming by.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 We're just going to get him to do some free-for-long form?

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Yeah, Dion's coming by, do some stand-up sets, I'll do a couple of magic tricks.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Matt, this is a bad idea.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 This is a bad idea, Matt, because after you sit down for a couple of minutes, Paul's going to be like, "They've seen funny stuff now, we don't need to get back up again."

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 What are you talking about?

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You're going to do a couple of sets and then you're going to sit down and start talking to people and you're going to be like, "We don't need to do any more sets, we're good."

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Are you crazy?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 No, man. You don't know. No, no, no, no, no.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I don't know if you see the reaction from your other business partner, but we both know.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 What are you talking about?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 No, man, we've been doing double bucket shows for the last few Scoop Fests.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 It's been great.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Who knows what it's all about?

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Yeah.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I know, I know. I'm not going to ... It's going to be so good.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 If we go late enough, we might get a cameo from a New Jersey celebrity. We'll see.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Fantastic.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I'm not going to put the name out there, but ...

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Bruce.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I'm not kidding. I am down to improvise until the wee hours with new players and players that I know are good. That's going to be super, super fun. I'm hungry for that shit.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yeah.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Hungry for that shit, yeah.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And can smash burgers.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Just starting teaching this week. The 20th will be my first class, officially, outside of my free classes that I've been doing, which were great.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 They've really been serving the job of getting my improv muscle back in shape, and especially my teaching stuff.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Very good.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Yeah. Yeah, very excited.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Well, in two nights, yeah, I got my improv jam reunion at the Smod Castle.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Kevin Smith is also doing an event that night where he's going to do something with mall rats, so I might run into my old buddy, Kev.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Yeah.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I might be able to ...

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Hey, man.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Get you a selfie.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Get me pleasantries and ...

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Yes. Toss him a chip, baby.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 A friend of mine wrote me, he said, "He's coming." And he goes, "Wait, can I get a picture with Kevin Smith?" And I said, "I mean, I can't help you with that, but yes."

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 As far as I'm concerned, you can.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 You know, I don't know. I think, honestly ...

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Either Kevin Smith doesn't remember who I am, which is very likely.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Yeah.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Right.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Or if he does, he seems like he'd be like, "Hey, let's get a photo." It's not going to be ...

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't know, man. I don't know.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He has become incredibly sentimental and sort of water under the bridge about a lot of stuff, especially after the big heart attack event.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Yeah. Right.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And that's only been like five years.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 All right.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I think you might ...

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 There's no reason to light this candle of hope for me, Paul, but let's go for it.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 This is the role I play. I sit down and say I've done enough, and I tell people ...

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 To go and make up with their mortal enemies.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I've done enough.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I've already been funny today. I don't need to be funny anymore.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I mean, there comes a certain point of diminishing returns, Jacob.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Don't I know it.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I'm getting some good guesses on who the New Jersey celebrity is.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Southside Johnny.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Chris Christie.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Chris Christie.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Oh, Chris Christie.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Oh, man.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I feel like we could get Southside Johnny.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I feel like we could get Chris Christie.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I should maybe just make some calls right now, just to put a cap on it.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 God damn.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I think the Asbury Jukes might just be the house band.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 We were going to be there for dinner anyway, so why not?

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Thanks.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I guess we could tack on a 15-minute chip.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Southside Johnny is slowly becoming bit worthy.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I have more scoops, like right me, be like, "Wait, who is the guy that you guys always talk about?"

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And I have to always be like Southside Johnny.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I keep forgetting the name.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I have been trying to get Southside Johnny to be a bit on this podcast for years.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It is finally reaching critical mass, where it would be a bit to get him to show up somewhere as a thing.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Yes, for sure.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Did we say this on air or no?

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But there was someone I was trying to get for the variety show that was going to make the crowd go wild that I couldn't get.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Oh, we did not say this on air.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 That is, we took a swing for Scoop Fest, and we weren't able to hit it.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I could not get in touch with Monroe.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I was trying so badly to get Monroe, the retired garbage truck driver, to come sing a song.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Come sing a song? You couldn't get him, huh?

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I was trying very hard to get Monroe to Scoop Fest.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 You were.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I didn't know anything.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Matt really worked to try to get Monroe.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I just could not find him.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I was like, "I don't know how I'm going to dance on this thin ice that we're going to dance on to get him in and out of Scoop Fest without him knowing.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 The joke is that he fucks my wife."

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 He was going to try.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I mean, you keep playing with that kindling, you're going to get a fire.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 It's up to you.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Monroe is either going to show up and sing it in the villa or fuck Matt's wife.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 That's what I mean, or both, buddy.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Or both.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Maybe. That's true.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 It can never happen, Paul.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I'm always home.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 What's that in the background?

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Oh, you're out of both.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Kate, I've been away since the very end of Scoop Fest.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I've been away.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Yeah.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 There are other semen you need to be worried about, my friend.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Good gravy.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Now, that's going to be exciting as hell.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 This week, I'm still just rolling from my eye emergency bullshit, which I think is going to just turn out to be much ado about nothing, tempest in a teapot type shit, I hope.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I get an x-ray next week to see what's happening.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And then I fly away, wee, New Jersey, the next day.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So, but, you know, never stops.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 You guys know, everybody's busy, busy, busy.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And between all my other little shit that I'm doing, we're getting our house finally painted and has been desperate to get the house painted for years.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Whoa.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And yeah, it's a big thing.

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 It's a big change.

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So our house was created in the '80s, and it very much is that...

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I like that Paul's house was created.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Other houses were built, but Paul's house created.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 This was created in the '80s.

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I like it.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And it's very much the same color as the Ford Tempo I used to drive back in the '80s.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And it is...

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I picture every Ford Tempo as being a shade of brown.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It is two-tone brown.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Good.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 This is where it's beginning.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And here's where we're going.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And it's already...

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 This is why you want to be on Zoom and on Twitch right here.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 That's right.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Because you get to see pictures of Paul's house getting painted.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yes.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's already happening.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Watch pictures of paint dry.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Has anything been more interesting than that?

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Nothing could be more exciting.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 But it's turning out...

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 iPhone videos of paint dry.

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It's turning out beautiful, honestly.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's really going to be gorgeous.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And you can see how much brighter interior it already is.

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 You know, just with one little application.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Oh, that is nice.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It really is nice.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And we're going to get white trim, and the brick's going to get worked on.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And what do you call that?

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 They're going to lime wash the brick so it's kind of light and all kinds of things like that.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So it's going to be really nice.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Oh, is that how they do the light, the scrape brick look?

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 That is oftentimes what is utilized, the lime wash.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Yes.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And so we are hoping that that all continues to move forward.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 We've got all the paint and everything.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 But the guy yesterday, as he's leaving, they had to leave early to go work on another job.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And I was like, okay.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And then he says, oh, I'll be back at 9 tomorrow in the morning.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So Ann and I both get up.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I get up early on my off day instead of sleeping my little butt away all day like I wanted to do.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I get up and make sure everything's ready to go.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Get the garage door open.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Get the paint cans set up and everything.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Let the snakes in.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And nothing, nobody, nothing.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Wow.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Nobody showed the whole day.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Finally, at right about one o'clock, the project coordinator called me up and was like, hey, yeah, nobody showed up today because blankety blank blank.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And I'm like, OK, well, all right, great.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 So but at least they touch base.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 This is far more communication than any other contractor in this Berg.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But that's true.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Just always the way it is.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 But it's fine.

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 We're already happy with how things are going.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But man, oh, man, if it ain't one thing, that's looking good.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Yeah, yeah, we're really we're really happy.

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And Ann's over the moon.

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And I, for one, cannot wait for you to get that white trim.

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 You're going to be so relaxed.

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I just need I need my white trim.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Well, we took they took down the shutters.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 They took down all the shutters and these shutters, these cheap old little plastic, fakey things.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 They're fake as hell, right?

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 They're not even.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 What if a tornado comes through?

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Then these would be the first things to go.

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They're not even they're just pieces of plastic.

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So as we pulled them all down, we must have got 10 different calcified ancient wasp hives.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Oh, yeah.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Out of the backs of those things is wild.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Yeah, yeah.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 But we've got we've got an excellent anti wasp plan.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Now, have I told you guys about Ann's fake wasp nests?

242
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 No, we have fake wasp nest strategically placed all over the yard.

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 We in that what's afraid of wasps?

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 I mean, besides humans and then I would like a human wasps was for afraid of other wasps.

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 If there is a wasp nest already constructed, they will they will make a point to not build a wasp nest within 40 yards.

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I think it is of.

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Oh, that's right.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Because wasps wasp use imperial measurements.

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I have heard this before.

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Yes, yes, yes.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 They will not use the metric.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 They do not use the metric.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It is the USA and wasps 40 yards.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 So these nests that she got the nest, they are they're basically Chinese lanterns, you know, without the lantern component.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But it just expands with a little wire frame inside loose little wire frame inside.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And it looks like just a little it looks like a wasp nest.

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 You hang them up in the trees and stuff.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And like our neighbors were like, oh, my God, you got and I'm like, no, no, no.

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Fakeity fake.

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 This is keeping the real deal at bay.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 You are overrun.

262
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 It's true.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 There were like three others, three of them in the backyard.

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 It's like you need to move immediately because they're about to be inundated.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 We're like, we're OK, we're OK.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So, yeah, my aunt had I so I never know the the right terminology for this anymore because back then it was the the Africanized bees.

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 You know, let's stick with that.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 That sounds right to me.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Yeah, let's don't change it from anything from that.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I just don't know what to actually I don't know what the real name of it is.

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 What the fuck is the real name of that?

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Would you have like technically, technically Zimbabwe?

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Whatever the real fucking name of that is supposed to be, that's what they called it.

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 That's what they called it.

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I'm not saying that.

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 That's what they called it in the 90s.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And my aunt's house got overrun with bees.

278
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 What?

279
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 To the to the point that they had to sell the house.

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That's one of Kurt Bronner's best comedy bits.

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 He closed out one of his specials.

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 He talks about my aunt's house.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It might be.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Yeah.

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He talks about a house being overrun with bees and how when they get in there, they discovered what was it?

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Ten million bees or something like that.

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Oh, this wasn't that bad.

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Still, I don't think this is I don't think this is Kurt's story.

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But that's how Kurt closes out one of his comedy specials talking about just how the fuck do you ignore that your home has 10 million bees in it?

290
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I mean, when it happened in my aunt's house, it was there was just a constant swarm of bees around the house.

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It was horrifying and no one knew why.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Well, that's the thing.

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 If you're from Zimbabwe, you don't notice.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That's right.

295
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Where the walls are paved with honey.

296
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I am not comfortable with that.

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Yeah, Penn's old place, the slammer was overrun with bees before its demise as well.

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 I do remember that.

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Yeah, they had they had a bunch of nests all over the place in that place.

300
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 You could see like honey honey running in from anywhere.

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 It was really strange.

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I just drove past this last week.

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I drove past where the slammer was.

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I was thinking about the slammer this week.

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So sad.

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Yeah, yeah.

307
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Just you can't even get just a big bunch of bunch of houses.

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You can't even figure out.

309
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Yeah.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Did they develop?

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's a whole development now.

312
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 It's a little little block in a neighborhood now.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Yeah, there were two.

315
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 There were two really cool houses right in that area.

316
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It was Penn's house and there was this giant white house that had like four windmills on it.

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And yeah, both of those houses are gone now.

318
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Those were like two weird houses right next to each other.

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And it made me sad that they're both gone.

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Yeah, yeah.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Yep.

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So I was just down in one of my stops was Boston, Massachusetts.

323
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Uh huh.

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So we were.

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Oh, I heard all about it.

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I talked to your wife the other day and she was like, I am doing this.

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I'm doing this and that's hanging out in Boston.

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 There's no getting around it.

329
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 This sucks to be her.

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I don't know how.

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Sorry, Sarah.

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And so like, do I just like call it every day?

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Be like, it's miserable for me to I'm doing nothing.

334
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 No, no, I think you're playing the right.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 No, because she's not buying that.

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 She's simply not buying it.

337
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Playing the right movie.

338
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 You got to just lean into it.

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 So one of the comedians on board is a guy named Rondell Sheridan.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Okay.

341
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I know Rondell Sheridan.

342
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 He's hilarious.

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 That's it.

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 He's a very funny.

345
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 He's on board your ship right now.

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Yes.

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Incredible.

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And so, uh, Rondell has been amazing, right?

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Yeah.

350
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It was funny because I once saw his show.

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It was funny.

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And then, uh, this guy on board, Tom, who knows like everyone who does Virgin Ships,

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 he goes, you never see Rondell Sheridan.

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 You see him do his shows and you see him come down for food and you never see him, uh, around.

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And then the second night, like we made conversations with Rondell and, uh, we started talking sports and stuff.

356
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And then, uh, uh, he started hanging out, started hanging out with us.

357
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Oh, yes.

358
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 So Rondell, most people know him as the dad from, uh, that's so Raven.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 He was, he was Raven's dad.

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Okay.

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And he's directed up, he's been and directed a bunch of shows for Disney Channel.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But you look at his old stand-up bits, there are old stand-up bits that you don't realize are his.

363
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 You go back and look and you're like, oh, that's, that's his.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Um, like the famous, uh, parachute man who survived after bouncing on the ground twice.

365
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I don't know if you remember that bit.

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But, um, so, uh, we're supposed to go to Maine.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 The seas are too rough and the currents are too strong for us to go to Maine.

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So the, the, the ship pulls an audible and just says, Hey, let's go to Boston early.

369
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Let's haul us to Boston and do an overnight.

370
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Yeah.

371
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Overnights are so rare and they're the fucking best.

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I've done, I did one in Tenerife, Spain.

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And it's just like, you, you, you just, the whole, the whole ship's just excited to roll into town and go out, go out for the night.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Right.

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 So it's just the buzz in the air or whatever.

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Well, what do you mean?

377
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 What's an overnight?

378
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 You get, you get to Boston at nighttime.

379
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Your ship basically becomes a hotel.

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 You are now in Boston for the night.

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Right.

382
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Okay, great.

383
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You don't have to come running back at 4 15 to make sure you don't get left behind.

384
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Right.

385
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Okay.

386
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 You got a floating hotel in Boston.

387
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Floating hotel in Boston.

388
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Everyone can stay out all night.

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Right.

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Great.

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 So, um, uh, Tom, that was one of the best things.

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I still talk about that from the, from the Bermuda scoop cruise.

393
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 That was great because that boat just parked at Bermuda and we had a hotel at Bermuda.

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 It was perfect.

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 It was so fun.

396
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It was so fun.

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Yeah.

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Killing out every night and stumbling back to the ship.

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Yes.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So, uh, you know, I haven't spent time out in Boston since I was like in my, like twenties.

401
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Like I, I, you know, who would, who would want to indeed.

402
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 So Tom does the research and turns out there's this magic lab, Boston magic lab.

403
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 A magic open mic.

404
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Uh, open mic with a wink face.

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Cause I, so as I was out shopping, I was like, I'm going to haul that.

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I'll haul, haul my ass back to the ship and throw some, throw some fish in a backpack

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and let's go.

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You know?

409
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Uh huh.

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Matt shows up with a fucking rolling suitcase.

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 All my, all two full cases.

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Let's go motherfuckers.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Um.

414
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Open this mic.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 But Tom does some advanced research as it turns out.

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 No, it's open mic.

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 It's a sign up.

418
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's beforehand.

419
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Okay.

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Not day out because people have to work on their tricks obviously or whatever.

421
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And so, so, uh, we were told that, no, it is a set lineup.

422
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Um, I mean, they should definitely have a couple of spaces put aside if somebody just

423
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 shows up.

424
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 This is, this is the debate.

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 This is the debate that we were having.

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Okay.

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Yeah.

428
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Tom did his due diligence because it's not of everything I do.

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Just being the cohost of Penn Sunday school is the big one.

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I mean, sure.

431
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Almost every magician listens to Penn Sunday school.

432
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Right.

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And so like, uh, um.

434
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 You were known in the world of magic if for no other reason than because of that show.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And then one of the guys in the lineup has done Fool's a couple of times.

436
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 The guy named Tyler Twalby.

437
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So you've got the connects.

438
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Yeah.

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And so, uh, but I, uh, I, I, uh, but no, no, no, we, we make no waves and there's no,

440
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 there's no scuttlebutt that we are there.

441
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 We just, we just buy tickets.

442
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 We watch and then we watched open mic and it's an open mic.

443
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It is.

444
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It is an open mic.

445
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Like, like comedians have an open mic, like musicians at a coffee house have an open mic.

446
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 It is the same open mic.

447
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 That's not, not better or worse.

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 It is as good as an open mic.

449
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 The level of goodness is open mic level.

450
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It is an open mic.

451
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 It is an open faced mic.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Hot and brown.

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 But what's cool is because it's like this open mic, like concept is that no one was

454
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 just doing a trick they bought.

455
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And no one was doing like a, and no one was just doing like a, uh, you know, an off the

456
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 rack trick.

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Like everyone was going for something different, original or something with some kind of intellectual

458
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 bite, something with some kind of narrative, something with some kind of feel.

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So I did like, I did really like that a lot.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Um, and my buddy Tyler did kill it.

461
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 He did a really fun, uh, couple of routines and stuff.

462
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And that part was great.

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Uh, but there was a guy who was so socially awkward.

464
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I mean, they were all like college professors and shit like that.

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Um, you know, it's like a magic club basically.

466
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And, um, uh, he was this older Asian professor who dressed up like Marty McFly from back to

467
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 the future.

468
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Oh, I love this person already.

469
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I know.

470
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And this is like, he was so like shy and like, you know, like just, but he worked on his

471
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 script within an inch of its life and it was really well written.

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Yes.

473
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And he was doing time machine stuff with a, uh, an hourglass, like different little, mini

474
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 hourglass.

475
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And then he was doing coin stuff where coins were disappearing and returned to his hands

476
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 based on the hour.

477
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Oh, he just dressed like Marty McFly.

478
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 He, so he wasn't doing like a Marty McFly bit.

479
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 He was doing a time traveling bit.

480
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Oh, this is good.

481
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 This is a good, this is a fine bit.

482
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I'm, I'm very happy with this bit.

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And sometimes wasn't, wasn't laughing at some of his jokes because he was just delivering

484
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 so like, like, like stone cold across the board.

485
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I just turned to Tom and I was like, I love this guy.

486
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I'm in love with this man.

487
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 I fucking love him.

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And I was laughing at all of his bits and I was loving everything he was doing.

489
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Yeah.

490
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And he was making fun of himself for dressing like Marty McFly.

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And when you want to do time travel, that was like more significant.

492
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 He got a bigger hourglass.

493
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Like I got to go further back.

494
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Hold on.

495
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I just was like, I was like, no notes, man.

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Let me just buy this routine off of you.

497
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 This is great.

498
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 All you're missing is decades of social skills.

499
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Other than that, you are fucking nailing it.

500
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Golden.

501
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 He was, but he was actually so likable and everything.

502
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Wasn't even like, I'm being harsh, but he was, he was so likable and funny.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But yeah.

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 But then afterward, like it was funny.

505
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Like I went up to one guy and Tom went up to another guy.

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 No one decided to hold court.

507
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 No one decided to say, Hey, you're here.

508
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 We should introduce you to everybody.

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 We should get a photo.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 No, no one did that.

511
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 No one did that.

512
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Right.

513
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 That's what I'm saying.

514
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 That's nice.

515
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Oh no.

516
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I thought that they should.

517
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 I thought we should have all got a big photo.

518
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Oh, I see what you mean.

519
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Okay.

520
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Yeah.

521
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Fine.

522
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Because I put a photo up of it saying had a blast tonight at Boston magic lab and got

523
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 all these notes saying, I didn't know you were there.

524
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Holy shit.

525
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 I would have said, hello.

526
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Oh, I got all this stuff.

527
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And I was like, Oh, I did.

528
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I threw my name as much as comfortable as I am throwing my name around.

529
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I threw my name around.

530
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Right.

531
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Uh, which I guess, I guess, I guess as I was saying, it's surprisingly less than you'd

532
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 think.

533
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But then, Rondell wants to come out.

534
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Right.

535
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Does he come with you to the magic thing?

536
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 We find, we find, uh, he says he's too tired to go to the magic thing.

537
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Sure.

538
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 We all are Rondell.

539
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And, um, as a comedian not wanting to rush through a magic open mic, I totally understand.

540
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Yeah.

541
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Well, we decide we're going to go to a comedy club in the middle of Cambridge at the college,

542
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 the college comedy club.

543
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Okay.

544
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And so we roll up with Rondell Sheridan and guy recognizes him right away.

545
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Cause he's comedy royalty.

546
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Right.

547
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 He's standup royalty.

548
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,760
 That guy, is this that guy from Boston commons?

549
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
 Was he there?

550
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
 Who's that cat?

551
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,360
 That cat that came up with that TV show.

552
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 He was a standup.

553
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
 Oh, I don't know.

554
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,000
 I haven't heard of him for like a decade.

555
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Yeah.

556
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,760
 Oh, I need to look that up.

557
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,080
 But he, uh, Paul brought up a story.

558
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
 He doesn't know what the ending is.

559
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,000
 I just don't know the guy's name off and we sit down and that was the only part of your

560
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 story.

561
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,480
 It's the, uh, they, they of course come up and say, Hey, we can, we can get you a slot

562
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
 if you want to do time.

563
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,120
 And I go to comedy clubs, get it.

564
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,040
 These magic clubs could learn a thing or two from these comedy clubs.

565
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
 They know.

566
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,000
 I could easily had a spin pad and a couple of fish in my backpack.

567
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Anthony Clark, Anthony Clark was the comedian I was fishing for.

568
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Okay.

569
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Clark, who started.

570
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Oh yeah.

571
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Thank you for bringing it up.

572
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
 And just, just to be, uh, just to make sure we're being clear about the story, Anthony

573
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,480
 Clark, not involved in the story whatsoever.

574
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
 Okay.

575
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
 That's what I want.

576
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,800
 But I thought perhaps he might've been because I don't know what he's been doing besides

577
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,640
 possibly hiding in Boston, hosting open mic nights.

578
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,080
 I also don't know what Anthony Clark has been up to lately, but he might have been up to

579
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,320
 something with the following sponsor.

580
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
 I don't know.

581
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,640
 He might've been up to something with the following sponsor.

582
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
 It might've happened.

583
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,360
 I simply don't know what he's doing.

584
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,400
 Um, this was, this was a regular lineup night.

585
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,920
 This was not an open mic night.

586
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,480
 This was a following sponsor.

587
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 Oh, sorry.

588
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,120
 I was, I started reading the chat clever for my own good.

589
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
 Yeah.

590
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:15,160
 Go is brought to you by the fine people of go, go phone, go, go to the website.

591
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,000
 I think I'll just say, uh, four floors of whores.

592
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,360
 If you've got the balls, we've got the whores for floors of whores.

593
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,300
 That's from scoop me hard, uh, in 2025.

594
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
 So there you go.

595
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,200
 I was at this place last night.

596
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,520
 Hello everyone.

597
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,160
 That's me, Vincent price.

598
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:44,880
 I'm here to tell you about my newest attraction for floors of whores is open the doors.

599
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,560
 There are the whores doesn't matter what floor you choose because there they are.

600
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,560
 Come on in.

601
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,040
 Come on in.

602
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,200
 Would you like some porridge?

603
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,160
 I've got some on the stairs story.

604
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,440
 When you enter the first floor, you may notice many whores, but I'll have you know the second

605
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,320
 floor contains more.

606
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,960
 Open the door to the second floor.

607
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
 You'll find more whores.

608
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,040
 They a bore, a bore.

609
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,080
 So be exciting and give them something more.

610
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,500
 Oh, what's in this closet over here?

611
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,800
 It's not a storage.

612
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,280
 That's just storage for the porridge.

613
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,640
 That's porridge storage.

614
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,240
 You found my porridge storage.

615
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,720
 So did I have some porridge?

616
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
 Sure.

617
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
 Sure.

618
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,640
 Now go up the door to level three whore.

619
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 Guess what?

620
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:56,080
 More whores are you surprised?

621
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,520
 You shouldn't be because the name of the place is four floors of whores.

622
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
 Sam Elliott.

623
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,280
 I'm just waiting till we get to the fourth floor.

624
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,560
 This is Sam Elliott for whores original, cool whores original whores whores.

625
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:15,080
 Sam, who would have thought you would have been barring the door for floor four?

626
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,640
 Here in my house of many whores.

627
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,240
 Can I get by you please?

628
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
 No.

629
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
 Sam?

630
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
 Nope.

631
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
 Oh.

632
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
 Nope.

633
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,120
 Well, I guess this is where our tour ends.

634
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,600
 No more tours of floors for the four.

635
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,640
 You'll have to find out what's on floor four.

636
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:45,760
 I can almost guarantee you it's just more whores, but still, don't forget to try the

637
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
 porridge.

638
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,320
 I swear, honey, I go there for the porridge.

639
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,400
 And the conversation's with Vincent Price.

640
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,480
 I eat porridge and I talk to Vincent Price.

641
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,560
 You should come.

642
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,960
 The Nevada DMV doesn't know what happens to snitches, apparently.

643
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,440
 Have you heard about this?

644
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
 No.

645
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
 What happened?

646
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:25,120
 The Nevada DMV has started a program to what they say.

647
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
 So Matt knows this.

648
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,680
 Oh, I do know about this.

649
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,400
 This is fucked up.

650
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,280
 This is stupid.

651
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:38,300
 So Nevada has a problem, especially Las Vegas has a problem on the roads, and that is unregistered

652
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
 vehicles.

653
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
 Unlicensed?

654
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
 Just out there with you.

655
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
 Yeah, there are tons of unregistered.

656
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
 Yeah, yeah.

657
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,440
 No license plate on them, nothing.

658
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,920
 And so the Nevada DMV, I suppose in conjunction with Metro or whatever, they have started

659
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,800
 a program where it's just a tattle program.

660
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,280
 They have a thing on there where you can now report cars that are unregistered to the Nevada

661
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,560
 DMV.

662
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:09,720
 And I saw a report today that they got 1,500 reports on their first day.

663
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,200
 Jesus, 1,500.

664
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,340
 I don't know, but there's nothing to be done about this.

665
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:22,440
 I think this is just a thing about people leaving old cars in their yard.

666
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,040
 I mean, that's some of it.

667
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,520
 Some of it is absolutely neighbor snitching on neighbors for like, I'm tired of that junker

668
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
 sitting there.

669
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
 Yeah.

670
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
 There's a lot of that.

671
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
 There's a lot of that.

672
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,080
 But there's also just a lot of just snitching.

673
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,480
 That's not a good idea.

674
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,580
 It's a bad idea.

675
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,520
 They don't fucking know that snitches get snitches.

676
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
 Yeah.

677
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,440
 Ain't nobody told them.

678
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,080
 It's a terrible idea.

679
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,640
 I like that the DMV was basically dismantled through a hack and took a month to recover.

680
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,800
 And they're like, all right, now that we're back, let's start ratting people out.

681
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 Yeah.

682
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,640
 Sorry, we couldn't get shit done for a month.

683
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,080
 I've been getting hammered for this real ID thing.

684
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,040
 I traveled with a passport.

685
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,400
 Do you not have a real ID yet?

686
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
 No.

687
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,640
 I have a real ID and I went in and they're like, oh, we got hacked.

688
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,240
 We can't, we can't do anything.

689
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
 We can't get you set up.

690
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
 Oh my God.

691
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
 Right now.

692
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
 We have to make another appointment for you.

693
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
 They're like, we're not recovered from the hack yet.

694
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
 And I was like, oh, well, I'm glad you guys kept the appointments.

695
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,040
 Thanks for letting me know before I got here.

696
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,280
 What a bunch of, yeah, our appointments didn't get hacked, but everything else did.

697
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
 Yeah.

698
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 But sure.

699
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 Sure.

700
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,960
 Let's let's do that.

701
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,280
 The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has recently added a Nevada registration spotter

702
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,720
 report form on their website, which is intended solely for the purpose of reporting motor

703
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,920
 vehicles operating on Nevada roadways with expired, invalid, or no registration, including

704
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,080
 Nevada residents operating vehicles with illegal out of state plates.

705
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,600
 So they want, they want neighbors to report on each other.

706
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,680
 They say that this report is not intended for abandoned vehicles, traffic violations,

707
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,560
 stolen vehicles, parking violations, or other DMV related issues.

708
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,760
 This is only supposed to be for cars on the roadway without a registration.

709
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
 And we all know that's not the only thing that's getting reported.

710
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
 Yeah.

711
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
 Why?

712
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
 Yeah.

713
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
 Why doesn't make any sense?

714
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,500
 I never understood driving around Las Vegas.

715
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,800
 You will honestly see tons of vehicles with just no license plates and every time I would

716
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,880
 see that I'm like, why would a police officer not pull that person over immediately?

717
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,960
 A friend of mine got pulled over for fucking expired registration just the other night.

718
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,240
 And I was like, how, why, why did, why did this cop decide to finally pull you over for

719
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,160
 expired registration when there, there must've been 20 cars that drove past while you were

720
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,880
 stopped without license plates at all?

721
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 Yeah.

722
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,640
 I know that happened to you, Jacob, to another friend of yours when your friend's son was

723
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
 in your car.

724
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,000
 That is true.

725
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I do.

726
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,520
 I had a friend of mine's son was in my car with me and then my friend got pulled over

727
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:15,840
 in his son and me and his son went, huh, Jacob had to talk my son off the ledge.

728
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,800
 I was like, no, no, no.

729
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
 Everything's going to be fine.

730
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
 Everything's just fine.

731
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
 Yeah.

732
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
 Yeah.

733
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,120
 Yeah, galactic president scooper star is exactly right, it's like, when else does the government

734
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,160
 ask people to start informing on their neighbors?

735
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
 I'm sure it's fine.

736
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
 Yeah.

737
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
 Yeah.

738
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,120
 Probably not historically relevant in any way.

739
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,540
 Baby steps to some real bullshit y'all, just crack a book once in a while, you motherfucker.

740
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,440
 All I do want though, is to see all of these reports roll again.

741
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,640
 I just want to see just every single report that comes in, I want to see how it's worded.

742
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,960
 I want to see the report itself.

743
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
 I want to see all of it.

744
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,520
 What's the closest to like citizen's arrest we've really gotten here, which is like.

745
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:05,960
 I'm doing a citizen's arrest, doing a license plate to a concealed carry for your expired

746
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
 registration.

747
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,400
 How about that?

748
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,600
 I mean, what this is going to, this is going to cause big problems.

749
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,440
 And I'll tell you what it's going to do.

750
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,120
 This is going to cause a fight where somebody is going to get killed in like a grocery store

751
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,000
 parking lot because two motherfuckers are going to start arguing and one of them is going

752
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,100
 to start like reporting it on the, on the web or something like that.

753
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,760
 And then somebody is going to get fucking stabbed in a parking lot all over, all over

754
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
 this shit.

755
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
 Yeah.

756
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
 It's going to be bad.

757
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,880
 This is, this is a bad idea.

758
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,760
 If anybody from the Nevada DMV is listening and I know you are, this is a bad idea.

759
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,280
 I mean, we're the number one Vegas parking and weather podcast.

760
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
 So of course that's right.

761
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,520
 They're tuning in to see where the car is getting parked.

762
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,880
 No one does it better than ICS, especially not the Nevada DMV.

763
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
 No.

764
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,120
 Get your shit together.

765
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,280
 You're absolutely right, Jacob.

766
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,180
 Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

767
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,280
 I also have been seeing through the national media, what little trickles down that Vegas

768
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,240
 had some serious flooding this last week.

769
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
 Oh yeah.

770
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,040
 We had a, we had a crazy rainstorm blow through here.

771
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,880
 We had hail at the house.

772
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,840
 We had, we had hail at my house.

773
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:27,560
 Uh, yeah, it was, it was, uh, this does not sound like much anywhere else, but, but we

774
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,440
 had over an inch and a half of rain in about an hour.

775
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,400
 Get the fuck out of, no, that's, that's insane.

776
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,640
 I didn't realize it was that bad.

777
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,520
 That's major for, for Vegas.

778
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
 That's a death.

779
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
 Yeah.

780
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,280
 No, no, no, no, multiple, multiple people died.

781
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
 People died, right?

782
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
 Yeah.

783
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
 Yeah.

784
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,360
 They found multiple bodies, uh, drowned and yeah, yeah, all that terrible stuff.

785
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,760
 Um, yeah, it was, it, it just like, it came out of nowhere.

786
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,560
 It blew in and it was horrible.

787
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,520
 Apparently it was off of a tropical storm, uh, Priscilla.

788
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,520
 I think they said it was a remnant of a tropical storm.

789
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 Queen of the desert.

790
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
 Like I believe so.

791
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
 Queen of the Mojave.

792
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
 Yep.

793
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,680
 Well, she did bring water.

794
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,200
 Yes.

795
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,560
 She left her.

796
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
 That's a good question.

797
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,720
 I think president scooper star McScoops a lot was the obelisk damaged, uh, in my, in

798
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
 my backyard.

799
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,160
 The obelisk has been put away.

800
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,800
 So thankfully the obelisk was safe.

801
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
 Good.

802
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
 Good.

803
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
 Good.

804
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
 Weirdly.

805
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,320
 Uh, my wife didn't want an obelisk just sitting in the backyard year round because she is

806
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,520
 a party pooper.

807
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
 Clearly.

808
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
 Boo.

809
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
 Boo.

810
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
 Her boo.

811
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
 My wife.

812
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
 Uh, don't boo.

813
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
 My wife.

814
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
 She'll punch you.

815
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,600
 When we last left off, Matt was just getting into a comedy club with Rondell Sheridan.

816
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
 Yes.

817
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,760
 So Rondell Sheridan goes in and this is a different open mic.

818
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
 It's a comedy open mic.

819
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
 No, it's not.

820
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
 It's a regular lineup.

821
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
 It's a lineup.

822
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
 Oh, it's a regular show.

823
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
 Yeah.

824
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
 Yeah.

825
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
 This is after the magic open mic.

826
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
 This is regular comedy show.

827
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
 Friday night in Boston.

828
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
 We're not doing open mics on Friday night in Boston.

829
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,900
 We're doing, uh, we're doing a lineup of, of, uh, Boston's best Colin Quinn, uh, just,

830
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,760
 just Colin Quinn.

831
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,320
 We can get your spot up on stage because right now we just have Colin Quinn.

832
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,360
 We actually need openers and features as well.

833
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,480
 Colin Quinn on a series of iPads on sticks around comedy clubs all across Boston.

834
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,160
 That'd be great.

835
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,160
 Colin Quinn performing at every comedy club in Boston simultaneously.

836
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:42,120
 Um, we were in a college town and so the comedians are all like thirties, you know,

837
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,000
 late twenties, early thirties, kind of, kind of folks.

838
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Collegiate.

839
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,920
 Rondell gets up and he announces that he is 67 years old and he starts doing bits and

840
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,160
 he just plows through like 15 minutes of just assassinating, just fucking killing and crushing

841
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
 across the thing.

842
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,480
 He finds this one guy, he did a little crowd work.

843
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,920
 He finds this one guy and he's like, uh, he goes, uh, uh, what do you do?

844
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,480
 He's like, I'm an MMA fighter and he's like, oh shit, I should stop talking to you.

845
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
 And he goes, what's your name?

846
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,720
 And the guy says, I think, I think I have it right, he goes, let's remain Montgomery.

847
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:34,720
 It's like the old Kian Peele bit, Rondell goes, man, could you have a blacker name than

848
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
 that?

849
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,600
 He goes, ain't nobody going to fight you.

850
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,760
 No one's going to sign up to fight with remain Montgomery.

851
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
 That's it.

852
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
 You're the champ.

853
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:51,320
 He goes, you're a legit fighter and he goes, yeah, I have my Texas fighting license.

854
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,680
 Oh, oh, that is legit.

855
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,800
 And the whole crowd is, you keep that with your fishing license, with your hunting license,

856
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:09,840
 with your fishing, fishing, only using guns, license, using guns, it is a special license.

857
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,360
 But Rondell killed it and then man, people lined up.

858
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
 We couldn't leave.

859
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
 We couldn't leave.

860
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
 People just light up.

861
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
 Everyone in the photo with them.

862
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
 Sure.

863
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
 Finally get them out of there.

864
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
 We pile into a pub.

865
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,520
 Everyone in the bar makes out who he is and the waitstaff is all taking photos with him.

866
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,300
 I had no idea how popular the show.

867
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
 I just said it.

868
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
 That's so Raven.

869
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
 That's a raven.

870
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
 Was.

871
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
 Different generation.

872
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
 Yeah.

873
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
 It's a different generation.

874
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,320
 It's after all of our, it's after all of our time.

875
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
 I'm aware of it.

876
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
 It's another choice of a new generation.

877
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,880
 Since then, I've been hanging out with Rondell.

878
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,080
 So we went out yesterday in Charleston, South Carolina.

879
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,680
 Oh, that's awesome.

880
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,080
 And I'm just going past Paul's joke and good, good, I gave it a thumbs down.

881
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
 He was.

882
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
 We were stopped constantly.

883
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
 Like I walked.

884
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,800
 I got on the boat without him for like an hour and I came at him back and we walked

885
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,080
 from the boat and I walked right back the path that I walked up and we couldn't catch

886
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,440
 up to our friends because he was being stopped so often by people who were filming out that

887
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
 it was him.

888
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,120
 And I was like, my God, I had no idea how, how, how famous this guy was.

889
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,520
 But he's been an absolute gem.

890
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,240
 We just been hanging out and joking around on the boat.

891
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
 It's been so fun.

892
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
 It's nice.

893
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,920
 Are you parked next to Disney cruise ships too?

894
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
 We're not.

895
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,760
 So say, cause that would tip it over to like insane everywhere we parked, uh, we, we, uh,

896
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,220
 we've been by our, by ourselves.

897
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,680
 Uh, why, why would the Disney thing be a different thing?

898
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,160
 Cause it shows on Disney channel.

899
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,520
 Oh, I see.

900
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,240
 That's so Raven is a Disney thing.

901
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
 Gotcha.

902
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
 Gotcha.

903
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
 Um, yeah.

904
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,080
 But so it's that super fun, super fun adventures with Rondell Sheridan.

905
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
 Yeah.

906
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
 Nice.

907
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
 Yeah.

908
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
 Nice.

909
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,640
 So did you get him a chip?

910
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
 Yep.

911
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
 Sure.

912
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,880
 Do you think we might be able to get him on the show sometime?

913
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
 Yes.

914
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,040
 I got him on the show.

915
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
 Yeah.

916
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
 Yeah.

917
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
 That'd be great.

918
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
 Yeah.

919
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
 He's not going to listen, but he'll come on.

920
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
 I don't care if he listens.

921
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
 Correct.

922
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 Correct.

923
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
 Yeah.

924
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,600
 I said that as a joke, but we all know it's, it's, it's just true.

925
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
 It's just true.

926
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
 Yeah.

927
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
 Yeah.

928
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,600
 Uh, I'll tell you who else we might be able to get on the show sometime.

929
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,160
 If we work really hard at it and that's the following sponsor.

930
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,840
 Today's show is brought to you by four floors.

931
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
 No, I'm kidding.

932
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,440
 The fourth floor.

933
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,080
 Columbastro private investigator in space.

934
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,160
 That's Columbastro.

935
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,280
 That's from the Microscoop in 2021.

936
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
 So it is.

937
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
 It's, it's requested from 2021.

938
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,580
 This is a bit from Geekshaq.

939
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,200
 It is.

940
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
 Next commercial.

941
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:56,240
 Excuse me, excuse me, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to, uh, come into your, uh, your, uh, uh,

942
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
 space here.

943
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,200
 I mean, I want to get into your airlock just for, just for one minute, you know, I, I don't

944
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,320
 want to deplete any oxygen systems here.

945
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
 Okay.

946
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
 Of course.

947
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,920
 You know, but I got to say, you know, one more question there.

948
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:17,600
 When you first encountered, uh, Mr. Zambalaxes, uh, did you actually realize he was the president

949
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,880
 of this alien world that you were hoping to invade or was that just a coincidence that

950
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,100
 you two just, uh, happened to hit it off?

951
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,640
 He and your, your, your space daughter, do I need a space lawyer right now?

952
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,400
 I look, sir, I'm not, I'm, I'm not a professional in any sense of the word, but I, you know,

953
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,480
 I just, I like to watch, I like to listen, I like to hear even in space, I can hear you

954
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
 scream.

955
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
 You know what I'm saying?

956
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
 But, uh, and look, okay.

957
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:48,480
 Uh, if you tell me that there's nothing to investigate here, I'm going to be on my way.

958
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,960
 Uh, but, uh, you just let me know if I can, uh, park my shuttlecraft, uh, over on your

959
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,140
 aft docking sport, uh, later, I was just going to leave it there for a half hour or so.

960
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,140
 One second.

961
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,200
 I'm space texting my space lawyer.

962
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
 That's fine.

963
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
 That's fine.

964
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,200
 I'll do do do do do do future sounds, futuristic sounds as I type it.

965
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
 Beep boop boop.

966
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
 Yeah.

967
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
 Okay.

968
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
 Well, all right.

969
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,200
 Well, I'll let you know.

970
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,200
 Hello, Matt.

971
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
 Natalie.

972
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
 I am your robot space lawyer.

973
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,200
 What can I do for you?

974
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
 I'm being questioned here by, was it Columbus?

975
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
 You said Columbus.

976
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
 Astro.

977
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
 I'm just a private detective.

978
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,200
 So out in space, that's, uh, you know, kind of what I do.

979
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
 Yeah.

980
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
 Just, yeah.

981
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
 Whatever you do, don't try to walk away from him.

982
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,280
 He will have one more thing.

983
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,520
 He wants to talk to you about, uh, no, that can't be true.

984
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,520
 I'm going to walk away.

985
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
 Right.

986
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,840
 I mean, that's, that seems a little, a little presumptuous of your, uh, your robot.

987
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
 That's quiet.

988
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,560
 But, uh, just one more thing before I do go, uh, I'm just going to, I'm going to float.

989
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
 I told you so.

990
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,560
 Good job.

991
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
 You're low gravity.

992
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,840
 I get to float around, but I did want to know, uh, just wanted to, are you yourself, sir,

993
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,520
 an avid collector of, uh, phaser rifles?

994
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,680
 Do you, uh, do you have a lot of phaser rifles in your home?

995
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
 Do you keep those loaded?

996
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,840
 Do you keep the, uh, phaser ammunition separate from the phaser rifles?

997
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,800
 Cause that's an illegal to hold phaser rifles in your home.

998
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
 Not at all.

999
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,120
 But you know, you do want to have a safety precautions.

1000
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,240
 You want to make sure that this, all right, I did it.

1001
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:32,100
 You got me, you got me again, check out every time I still think like we are not far away.

1002
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,240
 I should fucking write that treatment because I don't know if you know.

1003
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
 Do you know?

1004
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,600
 Do I know how much time is being made right now?

1005
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
 Yes.

1006
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
 Right.

1007
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
 You're right.

1008
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,680
 But, uh, are you talking about the movement?

1009
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,920
 I'm talking about movement.

1010
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,520
 I'm talking about Katherine Janeway, Captain Katherine Janeway.

1011
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,760
 Um, what's that actress's name?

1012
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,080
 I'm fucking blanking on her name.

1013
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
 Everybody drink.

1014
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
 Katherine Jones.

1015
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,400
 No way.

1016
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
 Kate Mulgrew.

1017
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
 Thank you, chat.

1018
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,000
 So I don't know if you know, but early in Kate Mulgrew's career, she portrayed none

1019
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,240
 other than lady Columbo.

1020
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,660
 So it's not that far to have a space Columbo happening.

1021
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,280
 She is a space detective.

1022
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,840
 I think it would be great.

1023
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,800
 I would love, let me text my space lawyer right now.

1024
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,440
 Oh, get ahold of him.

1025
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,640
 Oh, he doesn't sound.

1026
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
 You rang, sir.

1027
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
 Oh, yes.

1028
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,280
 There's a lady Columbo here wants to talk to me about.

1029
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,840
 Oh, just got one more thing please.

1030
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,520
 Just give me one moment.

1031
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
 Just one moment.

1032
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
 Oh, Jacote.

1033
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
 Jacote, you are my rock.

1034
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,400
 I can't.

1035
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
 You know what I need?

1036
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,920
 I need a stiff cup of coffee.

1037
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
 Hot.

1038
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
 What's going on with Seven?

1039
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
 Where is she?

1040
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,280
 I like that sparky young boy.

1041
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:12,320
 Did you see the movement to replace Christopher Columbus statues with Columbo statues?

1042
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
 Yes.

1043
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
 Yes.

1044
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,800
 And I'm 100% here for it.

1045
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,800
 Man.

1046
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,800
 It's a great idea.

1047
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,520
 I am watching Task on HBO.

1048
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,720
 Okay.

1049
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,680
 And that is a very dark, dark show.

1050
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,800
 And the makers of Mayor of Easttown, which is already a very dark show.

1051
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,240
 So you've been able to stick with it.

1052
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,200
 We bounced off so early.

1053
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
 It is so good.

1054
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,200
 It is so depressing.

1055
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,760
 And it is so dark that I get anyone making me depressed.

1056
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,760
 Yeah.

1057
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,920
 It is amazing acting about a very depressing area of our country.

1058
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,920
 Yeah.

1059
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,840
 It is so sad.

1060
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,520
 And it's math, right?

1061
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,600
 There's a, there's a thing with the, I mean, the plot line.

1062
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,720
 The plot line's a little meth-y, but I don't know.

1063
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,520
 Got him!

1064
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,520
 It's more of a history and science than math.

1065
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
 Gotcha.

1066
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,520
 Gotcha.

1067
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
 No, no, no.

1068
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:14,000
 There's, there's kilos of, I think it's heroin in it, that play a key plot point.

1069
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,640
 But it more ends up being about like, kind of like, is the system, like other corrupt

1070
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,960
 people in the system kind of thing.

1071
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:29,440
 So, but Mark Ruffalo just is Colombo, like he just, he just is Colombo.

1072
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
 He's just doing a Colombo impression.

1073
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,440
 Channeling Colombo.

1074
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,800
 He's exactly like Peter Falk, mosing in and out, like he's an older, you know, out of

1075
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,800
 shape.

1076
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,440
 He definitely has the disheveled thing going on.

1077
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
 That's it.

1078
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,160
 He's got this big disheveled hair, which is exactly like Peter Falk's hair.

1079
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
 Yep.

1080
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,160
 He's got frumpy, wrinkly shirts.

1081
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
 Oh, that's great.

1082
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,760
 He's the guy who's been out of the field, he gets called back in the field because it's

1083
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,920
 an emergency situation, and so he gets called back to head of task force, and he doesn't

1084
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,720
 know who he can trust on his own force.

1085
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,120
 And so he does things where he starts questioning people, trying to break them down.

1086
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
 And I am laughing.

1087
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,260
 I'm like, this is just, he's like mosing in, he's aching, you know.

1088
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,720
 Just one more thing.

1089
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
 It's a few plot points.

1090
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,000
 He's having like a head injury and a back injury, and so he's just, you know, touching

1091
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,320
 his head and moseying in and seeming kind of out of it, and then questioning people

1092
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,880
 and making them want to confess to things.

1093
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,520
 And I'm like, this is just, this is just secretly high end Hollywood white trash Columbo at

1094
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,700
 the same time.

1095
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:35,680
 This is just all, and I, it's really distracting because it's such a dead serious show.

1096
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
 I bet.

1097
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,680
 Because he's so good.

1098
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,680
 Yeah.

1099
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,640
 But no, it's a tough show to get.

1100
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,120
 I love it, but it's a tough show to get through for sure.

1101
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,920
 If I wasn't on a cruise ship alone, constantly staying up from four o'clock in the morning

1102
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,240
 watching stuff, I would do it.

1103
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,080
 I'm also watching Peacemaker, which I really love Peacemaker.

1104
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,600
 We just watched another episode of Peacemaker last night.

1105
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,800
 This new season is kind of amazing.

1106
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,960
 Yeah.

1107
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,760
 The writing in this season is just really, really good.

1108
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
 Oh my God.

1109
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
 There's a running gag.

1110
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,000
 It is so ridiculous.

1111
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,600
 Tim Meadows plays a character in this season.

1112
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,820
 It's so great.

1113
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,240
 And Tim Meadows says he has a condition called bird blindness, where he can't distinguish

1114
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,640
 any kind of bird from any other kind of bird.

1115
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,640
 And they find ways for this to come up.

1116
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,120
 Like all, like you forget that there was like a bird in the equation and all of a sudden

1117
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,140
 Tim Meadows talks and he just says something totally wrong.

1118
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,140
 And then everyone looks at him.

1119
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,800
 He's like, what, are you going to be prejudiced against my, my, my bird blindness?

1120
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,940
 You cannot use my disability against me.

1121
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,080
 His bird blindness is one of the funniest things.

1122
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,080
 Whoever came up with that in the writer's room was just like, oh man.

1123
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,080
 There's probably James Gunn.

1124
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,080
 I don't know.

1125
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
 It might be James Gunn.

1126
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,200
 I don't know anything else about his character.

1127
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
 And I don't care.

1128
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
 I know.

1129
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
 It's fine.

1130
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,640
 Like I know he, I know he works for the, the, the agency in some capacity.

1131
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,640
 I don't know what he does.

1132
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,840
 I don't care.

1133
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,800
 He is bird blind.

1134
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:18,040
 Everything else matters and they make it important to the plot.

1135
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,720
 I've got, I've got to see it.

1136
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
 It's not just an aside.

1137
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
 It is plot crucial.

1138
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,360
 I love it so much.

1139
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,860
 So good.

1140
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,000
 Every time it comes up, we just howl.

1141
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 It's great.

1142
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 Yeah.

1143
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 That sounds awesome.

1144
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 Oh yeah.

1145
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 And gives everybody terrible nicknames too.

1146
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 That's true.

1147
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 That is true.

1148
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 Yeah.

1149
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 But, but that's still, that's, that's all fine.

1150
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 Yeah.

1151
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 That's, I'm really enjoying that as well.

1152
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 But yeah.

1153
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 Yeah.

1154
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,940
 Uh, also, uh, we wanted to get into it, but holy shit, John Oliver is just perfect.

1155
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,940
 I had to catch up.

1156
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,760
 John Oliver's show is just perfect.

1157
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,760
 Yeah.

1158
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,760
 I have to catch up.

1159
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,000
 I was watching the season at South Park.

1160
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 I'm enjoying that.

1161
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 Yep.

1162
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 Um, but I have to catch up on John Oliver.

1163
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,080
 Uh, yeah, it turns out, uh, and we all know this.

1164
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,480
 We all comment on this every time it happens, but it turns out when, uh, the political leadership

1165
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,640
 in the country is terrible, uh, the comedy does get really good.

1166
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
 Yeah.

1167
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,040
 That is the upside to all these things is the comedy does get really good.

1168
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,040
 Yeah.

1169
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
 Yeah.

1170
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,680
 I have to, uh, not good enough to make it worth it, but still good.

1171
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,680
 Sorry.

1172
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,680
 I'm just getting a call.

1173
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,680
 I have to take this.

1174
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,680
 It's Hollywood.

1175
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
 Excuse me.

1176
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,680
 Oh no.

1177
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,680
 It's a space lawyer.

1178
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,680
 I'm sorry.

1179
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,680
 Just got one question for you.

1180
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,360
 No, I, I'm doing a podcast right now.

1181
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,560
 I can't, I, I'll have to call you back later.

1182
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
 Okay.

1183
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,560
 You say that.

1184
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
 Okay.

1185
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,560
 Oh, that was easy.

1186
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,960
 Hey, you guys want to do a little scoop mail?

1187
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,960
 Let's do a little scoop mail.

1188
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,760
 Kurt is texting me right now, so I'm texting you.

1189
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,760
 Fantastic.

1190
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
 Oh good.

1191
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,760
 Tell him I just brought up his awesome house full of bees bit.

1192
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,960
 I plugged his house full of bees bit up.

1193
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
 Special.

1194
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
 That's why he's texting.

1195
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,360
 He's texting that to, uh, to thank him for you bringing that up.

1196
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,640
 He suddenly saw a giant influx of a bee.

1197
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
 I really do hope we get Kurt back on the show.

1198
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,840
 You don't know Paul, but he's my comedy partner and he loves the bee thing.

1199
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
 Yeah.

1200
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
 Exactly.

1201
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
 Exactly.

1202
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,560
 No, I hope, I hope we get Kurt on the show again sooner than later.

1203
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,840
 We got an email here from nincomscoop.

1204
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,360
 No, really ICS is making me smarter.

1205
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,440
 That, that seems impossible.

1206
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,440
 What?

1207
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,320
 My family has decided to visit Japan next year.

1208
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,400
 We are all trying to learn some Japanese.

1209
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,080
 I have been taking a deep dive into learning the language because I've always wanted to

1210
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,960
 and why the fuck not?

1211
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:44,000
 One thing about learning Japanese is learning the kanji, those, uh, logo graphic characters

1212
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,920
 representing words and ideas.

1213
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,800
 I believe it's pronounced kanji.

1214
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,800
 Kanji.

1215
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
 Thank you.

1216
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,280
 Uh, there are tens of thousands of them and learning them, you have to remember the concept

1217
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,720
 and they usually have more than one pronunciation depending on context.

1218
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,640
 It's kind of a bitch to learn.

1219
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,960
 One helpful memorization technique is creating mnemonic pictures in your mind.

1220
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,120
 Uh, I've created a handful from ICS concepts.

1221
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,120
 Here's my favorite.

1222
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:15,840
 Oh, the kanji looks roughly like a man sitting in a car with what would be an, or what could

1223
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,360
 be an arm sticking out.

1224
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,280
 That man is actually Matt.

1225
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,280
 He's got his hand out.

1226
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,880
 Oh no, it's full of coins and he's about to throw it at another car shouting be the change.

1227
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:37,200
 Yep, this kanji means change and on and on of the, uh, primary con, uh, pronunciations

1228
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,200
 is ka.

1229
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,760
 Thanks for the help, Matt, I guess.

1230
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,000
 Loving you all sexually.

1231
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,640
 That's nin come scoop.

1232
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:49,040
 It's the least I could do, quite frankly, the least I could do.

1233
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,040
 Literally.

1234
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,040
 Yeah.

1235
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,200
 Uh, we got one here from Big Sexy, hola mi amigos.

1236
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,520
 I am loving the streaming and wanted to chime in on the red flag stories, but I was in the

1237
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,960
 lobby of a hospital waiting to see cardiologists at that moment.

1238
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,520
 Uh, so I didn't do it right then.

1239
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,280
 So I decided to write in, I was dating this woman we'll call her Evelyn because that's

1240
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,280
 her name.

1241
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,240
 And she was this beautiful, hard of hearing mother of two.

1242
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,720
 The hard of hearing part was new to me and it rekindled my interest in learning sign

1243
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,720
 language.

1244
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,360
 Oh, we got two language emails right off the bat.

1245
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,480
 That's cool.

1246
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,760
 The red flags came from two different areas.

1247
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,400
 First, she was incredibly disorganized and her apartment showcased.

1248
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,480
 Things were everywhere with no rhyme or reason.

1249
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,460
 It made going to her place a nightmare for my OCD brain.

1250
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,280
 Books were piled on floors and dressers, clothes placed willy nilly and nothing in the kitchen

1251
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,280
 made sense.

1252
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,560
 I just have to back up for just a second here.

1253
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,080
 Uh, Big Sexy, I might've just messed up your email.

1254
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,820
 I said it made it a nightmare for his OCD brain.

1255
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,880
 That isn't actually what he typed.

1256
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,760
 He typed as his OC brain so I don't know if he's referring to his Orange County brain

1257
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,480
 or his OCD brain.

1258
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,680
 I suppose those are two very different things.

1259
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,880
 So Big Sexy, if you meant Orange County and I corrected it to OCD, I apologize.

1260
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,000
 It was hoarder status, but the kitchen made sense.

1261
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,100
 It was, oh sorry, sorry, I'm reading two different lines here.

1262
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,680
 Books were piled on the floor and dressers, clothes placed willy nilly and nothing in

1263
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,920
 the kitchen made sense.

1264
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,760
 It was hoarder status, but for books and clothes, we couldn't have sex without me kicking over

1265
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,040
 a stack of Judy Blume novels or self-help guides.

1266
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:36,640
 The bigger red flag flying from the highest flagpole though, was her parenting.

1267
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,200
 First and foremost, like Paul and Jacob, I have no kids.

1268
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,760
 I did work at a boy's home at the time so raising kids wasn't a new or unknown concept

1269
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,760
 to me.

1270
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,840
 I also understood the notion of boundaries, which apparently her children did not.

1271
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,560
 As the boyfriend, I made zero attempt to play daddy at all.

1272
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,960
 Not my place.

1273
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,240
 Deeply known by me, having had several stepmoms in my life and knowing they couldn't tell

1274
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,560
 me shit either, I made no attempts save for one.

1275
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,540
 Evelyn and I had just returned from a dinner date and had leftovers.

1276
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:14,880
 As we put them in the refrigerator, Evelyn clearly said, "Do not eat my food."

1277
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,760
 Later she went to run an errand.

1278
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,600
 As soon as she left, her daughter, around sixteen at the time, promptly made her way

1279
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,600
 to the fridge, cracked open mom's food and finished the meal.

1280
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,120
 When she pulled it out, I spoke up and said, "Hey, your mom said not to eat her food."

1281
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,240
 I did feel some kind of way since I paid for the meal.

1282
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,480
 Her daughter said, as most teens would, "Don't worry about it and you aren't my dad."

1283
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,240
 I had learned via the boy's home to pick my battles with the youths wisely.

1284
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,320
 This was not worth the fight.

1285
00:58:46,320 --> 00:59:00,640
 I did however mention it to their mom when she returned, and instead of reprimanding

1286
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,880
 her daughter, she said it happens all the time and she just let it go.

1287
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,400
 Growing up, that would have been a stern discussion and punishment in my home.

1288
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,280
 The fact that it happened often said that her kids have little respect for rules and

1289
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,000
 that they would have zero respect for mine were we to get even more serious and/or get

1290
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,800
 married, which is why Evelyn gave me the ultimatum, which is why when Evelyn gave me the ultimatum,

1291
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,580
 either this is moving to marriage or we need to break up, there was no hesitation when

1292
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,480
 I said, "Well, I guess we're done."

1293
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,480
 Yeah.

1294
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,480
 Which took her by surprise.

1295
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,840
 She walked it back, but it was too late.

1296
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,840
 Decision made.

1297
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,560
 Each of my relationships has had red flags.

1298
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,560
 Sometimes it was me.

1299
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,520
 Luckily, the red flags around my current relationship were able to be overcome and our marriage

1300
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,520
 is wonderful.

1301
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,520
 Yeah.

1302
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,280
 Glad you stuck that in there, Big Sexy.

1303
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,400
 Currently in the running for America's Favorite Couple Vote on Facebook, Shameless Plug.

1304
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,320
 Fucking you in the face and ignoring your boundaries.

1305
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,320
 That's Big Sexy.

1306
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
 Thanks, Big Sexy.

1307
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,320
 Thanks, Big Sexy.

1308
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,320
 Yeah.

1309
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,320
 Those are things.

1310
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,440
 That's tough.

1311
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,720
 I have not had that situation myself.

1312
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:20,160
 If any of you have seen Toast of London, one of my all-time favorite BBC comedies with

1313
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,560
 Matt Barry, holy shit, there's a hoarder girlfriend that he gets.

1314
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,080
 God damn.

1315
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,080
 It's remarkable.

1316
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:36,440
 They have to crawl into her bedroom over just 10 feet high newspapers and shit.

1317
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,720
 It's wild.

1318
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,280
 It's fucking wild.

1319
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,800
 It's such a funny, funny episode.

1320
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,200
 I think it's like the second episode.

1321
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,560
 It's really early in the series.

1322
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,200
 If you guys haven't seen Toast of London, highly recommend.

1323
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,840
 If you're what we do in the shadows fans, jump on Toast.

1324
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,440
 So fucking good.

1325
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,640
 Winner scoop.

1326
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,800
 It's amazing what men will put up with for some strange.

1327
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,040
 It is true that we can be blinded by a lot of shit sometimes.

1328
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,240
 It is true.

1329
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,240
 That is true.

1330
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,240
 That is true.

1331
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,240
 Yeah.

1332
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,440
 Speaking of being blinded by shit, you ain't going no shit because it's Jock vs. Nerd.

1333
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
 That's your claim.

1334
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
 I'm here to debate it.

1335
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,440
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1336
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,440
 Time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1337
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1338
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1339
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1340
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1341
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1342
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1343
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1344
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1345
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1346
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1347
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1348
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:39,440
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1349
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,520
 It's time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1350
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,520
 Of dating women with kids.

1351
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,960
 We got a scooper today from BeardedScoop3.

1352
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,560
 The categories are B&A song titles, B&A movie titles, B&A people, and B&A potpourri.

1353
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,440
 Do I know what B&A means?

1354
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,440
 What's B&A?

1355
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,600
 Breaking and acquiring?

1356
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,600
 No.

1357
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,040
 Oh, before and after.

1358
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,040
 Oh, before and after.

1359
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,040
 Okay.

1360
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,600
 BeardedScoop3 sent an email along with it.

1361
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,080
 Yeah, this scooper is entirely before and after.

1362
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,080
 So before and after song titles, before and after, what were the others?

1363
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,880
 Movie titles, people, and potpourri.

1364
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,880
 Oh, wow.

1365
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,880
 Matt, you're up first.

1366
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,880
 This is going to be Matt's.

1367
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
 Matt's going to crush.

1368
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,880
 I know.

1369
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,400
 Matt's really good at the before and after ones.

1370
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
 Yeah.

1371
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,400
 All right.

1372
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,400
 Way to jinx me before 16 questions.

1373
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,400
 All right.

1374
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,720
 Let's do before and after movie titles, please.

1375
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,720
 Let's see here.

1376
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:39,520
 Luke Skywalker gets to know his father while Marty McFly gets close to his mother.

1377
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,000
 Empire Strikes Back to the Future.

1378
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
 There it is.

1379
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 Wow.

1380
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 He is so good at these.

1381
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 Right?

1382
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,200
 Oh, Matt is so good at these.

1383
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
 Paul.

1384
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,320
 Uh, I will try song titles.

1385
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
 Let's see here.

1386
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:58,520
 A 1980 Queen hit and one of Kansas's most popular songs.

1387
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
 1980.

1388
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,400
 I can't think of the song by Kansas now.

1389
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,720
 Yeah, I just say there's a lot of Queen hits, but I don't know any.

1390
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
 I know.

1391
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,800
 I know Kansas is a bunch of hits, but I don't know them.

1392
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,800
 Right.

1393
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:20,920
 We Will Rock You, Crazy Little Thing Called Love.

1394
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,560
 Bad Bottom Girls, Bad Bottom Girls.

1395
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,560
 Yeah.

1396
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,800
 I can't think of enough Kansas songs.

1397
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,760
 I'll have to pass.

1398
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,920
 That's me.

1399
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,520
 Let's see.

1400
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,320
 Crazy Little Thing Called, hmm.

1401
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,360
 You know any Kansas songs off the top of your head?

1402
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:49,000
 Like Carry On, Wayward Son, that's probably their biggest one.

1403
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,840
 Uh, I think that's some others too.

1404
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,840
 I don't know.

1405
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,840
 I pass.

1406
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,840
 Matt, you're really good at these.

1407
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
 What is it?

1408
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,840
 Pass.

1409
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,840
 Pass.

1410
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,160
 Another one Bites the Dust in the Wind.

1411
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,640
 That's a good one.

1412
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,640
 That is a good one.

1413
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,640
 That's a good one.

1414
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,640
 I'm mad.

1415
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,640
 I don't know Kansas songs.

1416
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,640
 Dust in the wind.

1417
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,640
 Let's see.

1418
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,880
 I'll try People for 400.

1419
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,440
 When this Cleopatra actress gets criticized for her numerous relationship, oh, I get it.

1420
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,920
 Numerous relationships, she just shakes it off.

1421
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,720
 So this would be Elizabeth Taylor Swift.

1422
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,720
 That's right.

1423
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,720
 There you go.

1424
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:26,720
 Yeah.

1425
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,720
 Matt.

1426
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,440
 Um, I'll go with People.

1427
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,440
 For 800.

1428
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,400
 Lead singer of Blondie meets the 33rd U.S. president.

1429
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,400
 Debbie Harry Truman.

1430
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,160
 You are so good at these.

1431
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,160
 Paul.

1432
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,600
 Uh, I'll try, uh, song titles again.

1433
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:59,360
 Song titles for 800, a popular anti-establishment song by CCR and a major hit for Dusty Springfield.

1434
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,400
 Uh, uh, Fortunate Son of a Bitch.

1435
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,200
 No, gotta be.

1436
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
 Yes.

1437
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,920
 Now it's Fortunate Son of a Preacher Man.

1438
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,920
 Ah, shit.

1439
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,240
 I was thinking of somebody completely different.

1440
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,400
 Oh, buddy.

1441
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,720
 I was thinking that now y'all messing with a son of a bitch.

1442
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,720
 By Dusty Springfield.

1443
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,080
 By Dusty Springfield, which is not Dusty Springfield.

1444
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,400
 I'll try movie titles for 800.

1445
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,440
 Rufus Sewell wakes up in a hotel bathroom with no memories, is saved by a heavenly being

1446
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,480
 that looks a lot like Nick Cage.

1447
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,440
 Oh, I don't know.

1448
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
 I guess I'll pass.

1449
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,440
 Matt.

1450
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,440
 Oh shit.

1451
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,440
 Okay.

1452
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,440
 Hold on.

1453
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
 Uh, who is that actor?

1454
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:55,160
 This is from, uh, uh, uh, um, oh man, boy, old brain creaky Lee working Creek Creek Creek.

1455
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,160
 It's not inception to run faster.

1456
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
 It's not inception.

1457
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,400
 It's, uh, what the hell's the first Nolan movie?

1458
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,400
 Uh, memento.

1459
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,480
 That's what I was thinking.

1460
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:15,840
 It says memento, uh, but I'm trying to make, I can't remember that actor's name.

1461
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,840
 Memento.

1462
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,980
 He's like confidential too.

1463
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,980
 So is it names?

1464
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:23,560
 It's the names of the names, right?

1465
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
 I think so.

1466
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,560
 Yeah.

1467
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,560
 Does movie titles or names?

1468
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,280
 I thought it was, I don't know.

1469
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,000
 Oh no, I think it has movie titles.

1470
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,760
 Oh, so I was doing the wrong thing.

1471
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,760
 Why?

1472
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,760
 I already said pass.

1473
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,760
 Oh well, Paul, I'll have to pass.

1474
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,960
 Dark city of angels, dark city of angels.

1475
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
 I don't know.

1476
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,960
 Dark city at all.

1477
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:48,960
 No.

1478
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,960
 Dark city is interesting.

1479
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,960
 Yeah.

1480
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,960
 Huh?

1481
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,960
 Uh, Matt, you're up.

1482
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:03,420
 Um, movie titles, please for 1200, the story of Westward and Bernstein breaking the water

1483

 Uh, the story of Woodward and Bernstein breaking the Watergate scandal plus an agency tasked

1486
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,920

01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,520
 Um, it's a, wait, I keep on playing that movie.

1488
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,120
 It's a, it's not, it's not deep throat.

1489
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,800
 Um, it's what I was thinking.

1490
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,800
 That's a whole different movie.

1491
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,800
 Excellent move.

1492
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,800
 I'll pass.

1493
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,800
 A whole different one.

 The president's men in black.

1498
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,880
 Yes.

1499
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,880
 That's a good one.

1500
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,880
 That is a good one.

1501
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,880
 Yeah.

1502
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,880
 Uh, Paul, you're up.

1503
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,880
 I'll close out movie titles, please.

1504
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,880
 All right.

1505
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,880
 For 2000 daily double.

1506
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,560
 Oh, now is my chance for redemption.

1507
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,280

01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,880
 Oh, yeah.

01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,880
 Iron Man of Steel.

1512
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,880
 That's it.

1513
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,880
 There you go.

1514
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,880
 Good job.

1515
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,640
 Oh, now Paul is in the commanding lead.

1516
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,640
 Yeah.

01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,640
 Matt has 1200.

1520
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,640
 I have 400.

1521
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,640
 How do I only have 400?

1522
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
 Uh, I guess I'm bad at this.

1523
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,040
 Matt's really good at this though.

1524
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,760
 I'll do, uh, people for 1200.

1525
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:22,640
 The director of Bullets Over Broadway plays basketball with the answer.

1526
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,380
 Oh, I don't know who the director of Bullets Over Broadway is.

1527
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,380
 I will pass.

1528
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,240
 Matt.

1529
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:38,120
 Um, let's see, that is, um, uh, uh, Woody Allen Iverson.

1530
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,120
 There it is.

01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,040
 Oh, of course.

1532
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,360
 I'm mad that I didn't know that Woody Allen directed Bullets Over Broadway.

1533
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,360
 Matt.

1534
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:54,320
 Um, let's go with, uh, people again.

1535
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,160

 John Oliver Clothes Off.

1541
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
 Good guess.

1542
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,920
 John Oliver Clothes Off.

1543
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,640
 Uh, pass.

1544
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,400
 Paul.

1545
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,740
 John Oliver Cromwell.

1546
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,080
 John Oliver Cromwell.

1547
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,680
 Lord Protector of England.

1548
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,680
 Good job.

1549
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,680
 Bordens.

1550
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,040
 1592, then 1628, September.

1551
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,240
 It's a Monty Python song.

1552
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,400
 I've got those dates, I'm sure I got those dates completely wrong, but, uh, Paul, you're

1553
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,400
 up.

1554
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,400
 Uh, potpourri.

1555
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:54,080
 For 400, the sweetest and sparkliest breakfast cereal races against the looming deadline.

1556
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,440
 What was this one?

1557
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,440
 Just potpourri?

1558
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,440
 Potpourri.

1559
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,440
 Yeah.

1560
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,560
 Sparkliest breakfast cereal.

1561
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,640
 Oh, Cinnamon Toast Crunch Time.

1562
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:14,920
 Cinnamon Toast Crunch Time is just correct.

1563
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,920
 Wow.

1564
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,240
 Paul is also really good at these.

1565
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:22,760
 I was about to say Fruit Loops of Fury, but then I was like, no, that's not what that

1566
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,760
 is.

1567
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:30,280
 I'll try song titles, I don't know, for 1200, I'm getting whooped in this.

1568
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,520
 A 1978 hit for Bob Seeger and the Moody Blues song about bedsheets.

1569
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,880
 A song about what?

1570
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,560
 And a song about bedsheets.

1571
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,160
 I have no idea.

1572
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,160
 Pass.

1573
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,240
 Well, this is so hard, it's not even a figure out, because what I have is I'm thinking of

1574
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:56,160
 Knight Moves, and then there's Knights and White Satin, but you can't do Knight Moves

1575
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,800
 and White Satin, so that doesn't work.

1576
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,640
 Knights and White Satin Moves?

1577
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,180
 No.

1578
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:15,480
 So I don't know if it's a Seeger song that ends in...

1579
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,760
 Wait.

1580
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,120
 Was this the song that Bob Seeger did about werewolves?

1581
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,440
 Oh, no, I was getting confused, he didn't do a song about werewolves, he had the Silver

1582
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
 Bullet Band.

1583
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,440
 Yeah.

1584
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
 Yeah.

1585
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
 Um.

1586
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,440
 I'll pass.

1587
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,440
 Paul!

1588
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,440
 Oh.

1589
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,440
 Moody Blues about bedsheets.

1590
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,440
 Pass.

1591
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,440
 Well, let's see.

1592
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,960
 Hollywood Knights and White Satin.

1593
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:48,560
 Hollywood Knights and White Satin, I said Hollywood Knights.

1594
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,560
 Halfway.

1595
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,000
 Matt, you got song titles or potpourri?

1596
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,360
 I got to chase Paul here, yeah?

1597
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,280
 So I'll go 2,000 potpourri, please.

1598
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,280
 Okay.

1599
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,280
 Ooh.

1600
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,000
 A documentary series detailing this singer's sexual abuse aired in 2019, hosted by the

1601
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,160
 woman who replaced Kathie Lee Gifford on live.

1602
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,640
 Huh?

1603
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,280
 Whoa.

1604
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,800
 A documentary series?

1605
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,800
 Uh-huh.

1606
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,320
 Who replaced Kathie Lee Gifford?

1607
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,000
 Old Scrawny Arms.

1608
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,240
 I think she changed her name, though.

1609
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,240
 I just don't know.

1610
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:37,240
 I'm gonna pass.

1611
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,040
 Paul!

1612
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,040
 Paul Mattingly.

1613
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,800
 I'm thinking it's not from Justin DeKelly Ripa.

1614
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,800
 What?

1615
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,800
 A documentary series?

1616
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,280
 From Justin DeKelly?

1617
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:58,120
 Is that sexual abuse?

1618
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,240
 A documentary?

1619
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,000
 From Justin DeKelly, it was a different type of abuse.

1620
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
 Yeah, exactly.

1621
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,600
 It was like Kelly Ripa, Jack the Ripa, Kelly Jack the Ripa.

1622
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
 I don't fucking pass.

1623
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,600
 That's it.

1624
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,600
 It's Kelly Jack the Ripa.

1625
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:29,520
 A documentary series detailing this singer's sexual abuse aired in 2019.

1626
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,560
 Was that Michael Jackson?

1627
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,280
 Michael Jackson Kelly?

1628
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:39,880
 Michael Jackson Kelly Ripa?

1629
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,760
 I can't remember what- oh, maybe it's P. Diddy?

1630
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,200
 No, I think it's the sexual abuse of the singer.

1631
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,200
 Oh.

1632
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,000
 Yeah, that's what I'm assuming.

1633
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 Oh.

1634
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
 Ah.

1635
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
 Oh.

1636
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,400
 Like, if Megyn Kelly were a singer, it'd be like Megyn Kelly Ripa.

1637
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,400
 Okay.

1638
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,920
 Oh, maybe that's it.

1639
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,040
 I don't think Megyn Kelly is a singer.

1640
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,280
 Who?

1641
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,480
 Is it R. Kelly, then?

1642
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
 R. Kelly Ripa?

1643
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,480
 Oh, it's R. Kelly Ripa.

1644
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,480
 That's exactly it.

1645
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,080
 It's gotta be R. Kelly Ripa.

1646
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,080
 R. Kelly Ripa.

1647
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
 Ah.

1648
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,080
 R. Kelly Ripa.

1649
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,080
 Ah.

1650
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,080
 Got there, y'all.

1651
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,080
 We got there, y'all.

1652
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
 Got there.

1653
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,080
 Took a village.

1654
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,080
 Lord.

1655
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,000
 Took a big- took a village on that one.

1656
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,680
 A big dumb village.

1657
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,680
 Paul.

1658
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,680
 You're up.

1659
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,680
 Me.

1660
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,680
 Us.

1661
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,680
 Three.

1662
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,680
 Idiots.

1663
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,680
 I agree, Lauren, by the way.

1664
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,680
 Those points should be shared.

1665
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,040
 However, there's not a button for that, so they're mine.

1666
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,040
 Song titles, please.

1667
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,120
 Song titles for 2000.

1668
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,120
 Yeah.

1669
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,320
 I hit from the Doors, self-titled album, and a 1970 hit for James Taylor.

1670
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,080
 Oh, boy.

1671
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,600
 Oh, God.

1672
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,600
 Like L.A. Woman.

1673
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,080
 I don't know enough-

1674
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,120
 It's the James Taylor part that's gonna slow me down.

1675
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,760
 I don't know enough to- Oh, come on, let me light your fire and rain.

1676
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,520
 Oh, good job.

1677
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,440
 Light my fire and rain is absolutely right.

1678
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,440
 Yeah.

1679
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,440
 Damn it.

1680
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,440
 I had that one that I thought you were gonna pass.

1681
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,440
 It's over.

1682
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,440
 I did, too.

1683
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,440
 It's over, everyone.

1684
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,440
 Go home.

1685
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,440
 Isn't that one Daily Double left?

1686
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,440
 No, there's one more Daily Double still in there.

1687
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,440
 Yeah, doesn't matter.

1688
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,440
 I think there is.

1689
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,440
 Doesn't matter.

1690
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,440
 Look at the scores, guys.

1691
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,440
 It only matters if Paul gets it and misses it.

1692
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,440
 Right.

1693
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,440
 Oh, I understand.

1694
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
 Oh, which I don't think- I don't think he can.

1695
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,440
 Oh, no, I can.

1696
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,440
 I just answered my last question, so haha.

1697
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,440
 Yeah, yeah.

1698
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,440
 Oh, never mind.

1699
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,440
 Yeah, it's over.

1700
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,440
 Maybe.

1701
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,440
 I don't know.

1702
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,440
 Yeah, but it's the Daily Double.

1703
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,440
 See?

1704
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,440
 There's the Daily Double.

1705
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,440
 If you get this, won't that take you over?

1706
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,440
 Uh, no.

1707
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,440
 Oh, okay.

1708
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,440
 Paul.

1709
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,440
 I have 2,400 points.

1710
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,440
 Paul.

1711
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,440
 You have 6,800 points.

1712
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,440
 If I double my points, how many points do I have?

1713
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,320
 Yeah, but don't you also get the 1,200?

1714
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,320
 Okay.

1715
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,320
 Brace yourself, everyone.

1716
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,280
 Paul's doing Kentucky math.

1717
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,280
 All right.

1718
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,280
 Go ahead.

1719
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:04,200
 The steamy BDSM Best Seller if it were set in Big and Little Eddie's Crumbling Hampton's

1720
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,200
 Mansion.

1721
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,320
 Oh, my God.

1722
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,000
 I got this.

1723
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
 Oh, I got this.

1724
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
 What the?

1725
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
 Yeah, I got this one, too.

1726
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
 I know the first part.

1727
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
 Fifty Shades of Grey.

1728
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,760
 There you go.

1729
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,080
 One more word.

1730
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,080
 Has to do with--

1731
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,080
 I know.

1732
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,780
 Has to do with taking care of plants.

1733
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,200
 It does not take place in Madison Square.

1734
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,200
 Right.

1735
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,200
 Oh.

1736
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,200
 Oh, okay.

1737
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,840
 Fifty Shades of Grey Basketball.

1738
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:46,080
 Oh, boy.

1739
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,080
 Grey Garden.

1740
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,080
 Yeah.

1741
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,080
 Yeah.

1742
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,080
 Yeah.

1743
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,080
 Fifty Shades of Grey Gardens.

1744
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,080
 All right.

1745
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,080
 We really helped Jacob today.

1746
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,080
 This has been a good day.

1747
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,080
 We did.

1748
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,080
 We really helped Jacob a lot today.

1749
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,080
 We did.

1750
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,080
 Matt, close it out.

1751
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,080
 The category end the game.

1752
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,080
 Potpourri for 800.

1753
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,080
 If I get this right--

1754
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,080
 The second place, it takes a village.

1755
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,760
 If I get this right, I'm in third, and if I lose, I'm in third.

1756
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,760
 Yep.

1757
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,760
 High stakes.

1758
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,760
 And if I pass--

1759
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,760
 Prince's iconic--

1760
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,640
 And if I pass it to Jacob, and he gets it, he's in second, and if he loses, he's in

1761
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,640
 second.

1762
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,040
 Or if you pass it to Paul and he misses, he's still in first.

1763
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,040
 Yeah.

1764
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,040
 It's high stakes.

1765
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,040
 But if he gets it, he's in first.

1766
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,040
 Prince's iconic movie/song needs to reschedule for another time.

1767
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,360
 Aw.

1768
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,360
 Oh.

1769
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,360
 Bassey just typed it in.

1770
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,360
 Purple rain check.

1771
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,360
 Thank you for that.

1772
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
 Just by typing it in the chat.

1773
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,360
 Oh!

1774
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,360
 There you go.

1775
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,840
 Much easier game if we just do that all the time.

1776
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,000
 I was thinking it was going to be something like Under the Cherry Moon.

1777
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,560
 I'll see you next Tuesday or something.

1778
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,480
 Well, I knew it was Purple Rain, but I didn't know the other one.

1779
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,440
 I really thought it was Under the Cherry Moon.

1780
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,840
 The movie Under the Cherry Moon?

1781
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,400
 I still think it's Under the Cherry Moon.

1782
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,400
 Yep.

1783
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,400
 Good.

1784
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
 Good.

1785
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,240
 So, Bassey, good job on that question.

1786
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:06,840
 I mean, I didn't get all my questions right by myself either.

1787
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,840
 But don't worry, Matt.

1788
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,840
 You're still really good at this.

1789
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:14,920
 Paul wins though with 6,800 points, I'm in second with 4,800, Matt is in third with 3,200,

1790
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,280
 but don't let that fool you.

1791
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,200
 He's very, very good at these.

1792
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,200
 Excellent.

1793
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,200
 And that's from BeardedScoop3.

1794
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,200
