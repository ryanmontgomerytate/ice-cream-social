 Wow, way to go. So, about that picture frame.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
 Ah, forget about it. Until Carvana makes one, I'm not interested.

 Here's a program.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 Yeah, I'd love to.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 Great. Let's go.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 [music]

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 Woohoo!

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 I'm down to the bone in San Antonio.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 Oh!

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 Making the sound more fun than they are.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
 Yeah. I wonder if that's an expression or not.

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 True.

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 [music]

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 It's time for Matt Maddly's Ice Cream Social, sitting in San Antonio. That's Matt Maddly.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Maddly.

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 And in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 We're pretty much in fun.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 Paul, you get a lot of action on the World Series.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 Yeah, I made all my money back by betting on the team that spent umpteen bajillion dollars to get a Japanese man who is an unparalleled phenomenon to just stand up there and do everything for them.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 That was a surprisingly knowledgeable breakdown of the World Series, Paul.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 I mean, you can't deny Shohei Atani. That guy is a once in a generation talent.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 I know, but now you blew it because it was Yamamoto who was the hero of the World Series.

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 Who?

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 Different Japanese player.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 We're back in the correct universe on the right podcast.

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 Great. We're good.

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 We'll just start it over. Here we go. Paul, you know who you're talking about, right?

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 Back to one, everyone.

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 [music]

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 Shohei Atani was amazing, but in game seven, he really couldn't hold up on short rest.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Yeah.

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 Taking that again. He had two hits, I think.

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 I think so. Something like that.

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,500
 He only won them four out of the five games they needed.

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 He was an incredible player, but they gave the MVP to Yamamoto.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 Oh, really?

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 Yes.

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 Yeah.

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,500
 Different pitcher. He came in and played really well. Also, like we're all on short rest and yeah.

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 Yeah.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
 Like the Super Bowl, I made a lot of bets on the World Series this year.

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 Okay.

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,500
 I think I had 12 different bets going. Like the Super Bowl, I somehow lost all of them.

75
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 Wow.

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 I didn't win a single bet out of all of my bets. Not one.

77
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 And I had a range of bets, but not a single one.

78
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 From safe to long shots?

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 I had weird bets. I had normal bets. Yeah. I had everything. I had parlays. I had singles. Not a one. I'm bad at that.

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 Well, you should know that I was talking to my friend Ryre about making different Marvel character cards for me as a magician,

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 because increasingly, I literally am going to stop doing the intro of my trick with baseball cards, saying who likes baseball?

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 Because the answer increasingly is no one.

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 There's very few people.

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 No one.

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
 Nothing like starting a trick off with a light smattering of applause.

86
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 I just heard the latest episode of Player One just dropped, and Phil was remarking how his son came to him, his 13-year-old son just the other day, and said, "Dad, what's the World Series?"

87
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 Oh, man. Also, my kids came home, right? I got them psyched up in the morning. You know what tonight is? Game seven.

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 Oh, yeah.

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 All teams have one, three games each, blah, blah, and my youngest fancies himself a Dodgers fan out of nowhere. I think probably his friend in school likes the Dodgers. We've watched zero games.

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Yeah, yeah. They're close to us. They're fine.

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 When I was like, "Game seven, the World Series," this is the time to watch, right?

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 Yeah.

93
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 So they're playing with their friends. They're not home in time. I'm watching the game by myself. Finally, they're ready to come home. I pick them up from their friend's house.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 It is like the ninth inning, and I go like, "It's the ninth inning of game seven," and the Dodgers have come back. They were down four to one. Now it's four to three.

95
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 And they go like, "Cool." And they watch for like five minutes, and then one says to the other, "Do you want to play basketball?" And they go, "Yeah." And they get up, and they go outside in the middle of the ninth inning and go play basketball.

96
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:38,500
 And I was like, "Mother..." And then I just started making them dinner or whatever, and then it goes into extra innings. So then I'm now serving them dinner during the extra innings, and now they're interested because we're sitting and eating.

97
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 Right.

98
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 And now they're all in. And then it ends up being a very exciting finish, and they were like amazed. And to them, they had an amazing game seven memory with Dad of watching the end of the World Series. And to me, I was just like...

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 They started watching it around like the 11th inning.

100
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 Exactly. I watched 10 innings without them. And then they came in, just top roped it at the end there.

101
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 I like that your memory of watching this World Series and their memory of watching this World Series are going to be very different, but involve each other.

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 Yeah. So I literally last night, I did this thing where I put baseball cards in a bucket, and I had this poll, and I bring it out to the people, and I just had five people shake their head no with me.

103
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
 And they didn't want anything to do with the baseball cards.

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 Yeah. And I was like, "You know it's just the first and the last name, right?" It's not like...

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 You don't have to be a baseball fan to participate in this trick.

106
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 You're not going to be called into the baseball fan's court tomorrow to sign an affidavit about your ability to love and admire every baseball player.

107
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 So annoying.

108
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 Baseball fan's court.

109
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 I was doing a show last night, it was Tuesday, and saw a smaller crowd, which is fine. I'm out in San Antonio, seven nights a week for the old Magic Saloon out here.

110
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 And so I'm doing the show, it's a light energy, it's like a weird energy, right? Because it's not that full, it's a big space.

111
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 Oh yeah.

112
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 And I'm experiencing what we're talking about here, and I finally was like, I literally was like, "Hey, I'm sorry, you're at a magic show, you're going to need to like, I don't know, do stuff, like you might have to read a thing or pick a card or like get up and touch a thing or say a thing."

113
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 And I know that this is a burden. I know that this is outside your comfort zone.

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 I know you all came in here expecting to be comfortable jurists sitting in the back and mildly observing magic from afar, and I apologize that only 20 some out of you have showed up.

115
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 I'm going to need you to get outside your comfort zone and maybe do a thing.

116
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 Yeah.

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 And I get this big laugh, and then I mess with a kid with my rope routine, and then I feel like, oh good, even though it's a small crowd, they're eating out of my hands.

118
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 I got 'em.

119
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 And then I finish arm chopper routine. I go into looking for a couple, and as I ask for a couple, six people get up and just leave.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 Oh.

121
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 Walk out.

122
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 Okay.

123
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 Shit.

124
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 I wasn't ready for that part of the story.

125
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,500
 Neither was I, Jacob, because I felt like I had won the crowd back.

126
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 If I don't have an audience with me and then someone's like, "Okay, I'm having that bad night," when you feel like you've done the right thing, and then they're still like, "Never mind."

127
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 And when it goes from 26 people down...

128
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 They all looked at each other and said, "Hey, you want to go outside and play basketball?"

129
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 Yeah.

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 They go from 26 people down to 20 people, it hurts the energy of the room, so to speak.

131
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 It's a notable percentage.

132
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 I was really in my head finishing my show.

133
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
 Oh, no.

134
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 And afterwards, someone goes, "Oh, no. Those six people are friends with one of the women who work here."

135
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 And they came by to visit because they had dinner reservations, and she invited them to watch the show, and they said yes, but then they had to leave because they had dinner reservations at 8 o'clock.

136
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 There you go.

137
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
 Wish you could have made that clearer to the magician on stage.

138
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:51,500
 I was like, "Do you understand that I, for all the reasons of the world, they did say this, but then you said that, and so I figured all about it." Do you understand the difference between people leaving because they had an obligation versus people leaving because they were upset with the show matters tremendously to the performer?

139
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 The only thing I want is for the audience to not actively hate me and leave.

140
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 Was there a moment...

141
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 It's really at the top of my list.

142
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,500
 And possibly leave a negative social media review that reflects on the theater that I'm playing and all this other stuff.

143
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 Was there a moment before they left that you thought could have triggered them?

144
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 No. Just so that the energy was... It was a low-energy room, right?

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
 It was simply that, you know...

146
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 Well, you did have the new... You had the new bit in the baseball card thing, right, where you pulled out your own bat?

147
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 Yeah.

148
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 I just showed it off, helicoptered it around a little bit.

149
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 I tap my penis on Mickey Mantle, like I do, and then boom, it becomes Ichiro Suzuki.

150
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
 The most magic wand.

151
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 Ladies and gentlemen, foreskin Joe Jackson.

152
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 Yes, I did put as many baseballs as possible into my foreskin.

153
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
 Oh, God!

154
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,500
 It turns out the answer is six. Six baseballs were possible.

155
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 Six baseballs into his foreskin.

156
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 This is an old baseball folk song.

157
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 And then I play Bing Crosby and I say, "This is my sack of oranges."

158
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 Jokes on them because they're red when they come out because of the blood.

159
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 I actually had one of my quickest jokes ever.

160
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 I tried to say one woman's name. She was like, "You're wrong. You're completely wrong."

161
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 I said, "Give me your name." She was foreign. I said, "Well, then break it down for me."

162
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 And then she goes, "Pre." And I go, "Pre." And she goes, "Ush." And I go, "Pre-ush."

163
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 And she goes, "Yeah." And I go, "Oh, that's like Sean Connery driving an electric car."

164
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 Yeah, that's a good one.

165
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 That's real good.

166
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 I was like, "No one can walk out on that. You can't walk out on that show."

167
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 On a pre-ush?

168
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 It turns out that was incorrect. Pre-ush.

169
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 Somebody said, "Leaf? What the fuck? What?"

170
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 The room manager was like, "Hey, I know the energy was weird tonight. I'm going to fill a show report. Is there anything you want in the show report?"

171
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 I said, "Maybe if we're welcoming guests via staff, they should stay for the whole show."

172
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 I said, "Maybe that should be a policy."

173
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 Or sit inconspicuously in the back where there's a place where they could sneak out easily or something at the very least.

174
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 Yeah, or just give me a really big heads up about it.

175
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 Yeah, yeah. Maybe a white board in the back that you can see where if anybody leaves, they write down the reason that they're leaving on their way out.

176
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 I would have wrote it into the show. I would have found a gag.

177
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 Yeah.

178
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 You know? Like I'm not going to work with a couple. If anyone feels like that marriage is rigged for the government, please leave now.

179
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 Well, that was a combo of situations, right? I mean, that's, you know, when it rains, it pours. You got weird energy, lighthouse, a couple of people bail in the middle. It's like, "What the fuck?" Yeah.

180
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 Yeah.

181
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 I mean, you could look at it and say, "These people are leaving because they have dinner reservations, and so it's really not that bad of a thing."

182
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 You could also look at it and say, "This magic show could have been so good that they could have decided to not go to dinner, but they didn't."

183
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 Right. It would be amazing if they hard sold it and got to be like, "Honestly, that is enough magic." Like that was incredible.

184
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 That was plenty.

185
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 I don't want to taint it with another trick. I saw perfection.

186
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 Jacob.

187
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 I'm afraid that the only thing that I can do now is like magic less, so I should leave.

188
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 I'm speaking purely for myself here, but a free magic show would have to be nigh miraculous for me to not want to go get food instead.

189
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 It would have to be something on the level of like, "Oh, that lady just apparated through a wall and ate her own shit and threw a monkey 50,000 feet in the air, and then a bomb went off."

190
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 Or simply say, "If I cannot find your food, I will hand you a one-foot roast beef sub, and then you hang in the balance."

191
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 Wait a minute. Are we talking like a Subway sandwich?

192
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,500
 What would be the meal to dangle for you, Paul? What would be the meal that I'd have to hold back as a magician to make you stick around?

193
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 To make me stick around?

194
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 Yeah, you might win this meal.

195
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 Oh, a Bobby? What about a Bobby, Paul?

196
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 A Bobby would probably work. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that would work. Like a fresh bowl of chicken and dumplings. Oh, Lord. Let's go.

197
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 I went to a place last night. It had a Southwest chicken and dumpling soup.

198
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
 So it had like corn and beans in it?

199
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 Yeah.

200
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 Yeah.

201
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
 I'm in. I'm in, in, in.

202
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 That sounds pretty tasty.

203
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 It was one of the most delicious soups I've ever had.

204
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 That sounds really good.

205
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
 It was the place called the Foundry, San Antonio's oldest bar.

206
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 That sounds really good.

207
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 I went to my buddy Oscar, who works here. Yeah, yeah.

208
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 I had the day open yesterday, so I got me a rental car and I bolted down to our friend Brian Brushwood's compound over in Austin, Texas.

209
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 Oh, nice.

210
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
 Yeah.

211
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 And I was like, I can't wait to sit in on great night with my pals Justin and Brian. And Justin Robert Young was occupied.

212
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 He decided that he needed to be in Washington, D.C. or something on election day and couldn't be out.

213
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 He had dinner reservations.

214
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
 He had dinner reservations.

215
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 It was an eventful day.

216
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 He was meeting up with six friends. Six friends at a restaurant in San Antonio.

217
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 In San Antonio.

218
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 It was an eventful day.

219
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 You passed him on the freeway.

220
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 So Brian's like, "Yeah, no, I just couldn't make it. This is perfect. So you can do a great night." I was like, "Okay, well, good. You could have told me ahead of time."

221
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 I was just going to be the two of us.

222
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 But if you listen to the latest episode of Great Night, it's just me once again trying to keep up with Brian Brushwood.

223
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 He is a very intellectual and smart person.

224
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 And so it's me doing my best to keep up with him.

225
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 We're doing it.

226
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 I am -- it's going from covert to overt.

227
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 But I am trying to coax Brian out of retirement as a magic performer.

228
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 His kids are starting to grow up. All the reasons why he stayed home are starting to go away.

229
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 And his stuff is so original and different and is not performed by anybody else.

230
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 And I am slowly trying to coax him into just maybe doing a live event or two.

231
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 Maybe we can get a straight magic performance from him at Scoop Fest next year or two years from now.

232
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 He did, right? How many years ago?

233
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 It was a long time ago.

234
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 He did. Yeah. And yeah, I'm trying to figure it out. I think we should try to play comedy clubs.

235
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 I don't think we should try to play theaters. That's my pitch to him.

236
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 I was going to ask, are you -- so you're pitching a duo thing?

237
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 I think so. Yeah.

238
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 You're not just pitching that he should go out on tour separate from you.

239
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 Oh, no, no. Yeah, no. Self-interest involved completely.

240
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Great.

241
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 Yeah. Because as you know, I discussed this.

242
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 I talked to a friend who's a manager and said, you know, what does it take to play comedy clubs?

243
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 And they're like, well, if you have 500,000 YouTube subscribers or stuff like that, that helps. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

244
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 And so I'm trying to build up all my stuff with social media.

245
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 And then I looked and I was like, wait, Brian Brushwood has two channels that are over a million subscribers?

246
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 Yeah. Yep.

247
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 Also, I feel like he's very funny and we haven't seen him do his thing in a while.

248
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 So I was like, I don't know. So I've got to -- he's -- he's -- he's harrumping about it, I believe.

249
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 I left him going like, oh, that would be a life change kind of thing.

250
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 Aha. We'll see. We'll see. But I don't really --

251
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 Ah, Brian, I think you should do it. I think it'd be great.

252
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 One vote for yes.

253
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 Yep. Brian, I talked to your kids. They want you to do it, too.

254
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 Rodimus Scoop is already saying that Josie and the Betacucks could be the live touring band with your act.

255
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 That works.

256
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 All right. That would work.

257
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 Yep.

258
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 No, but we get to do it. I would love to do it as a one-off as an experiment.

259
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,500
 And if it could grow into something that happened more often, then, you know, do all kinds of things like Ed.

260
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
 Do you --

261
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,500
 Ed Paul of The Mix, written improv set, and, you know, all kinds of stuff.

262
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 I'd love it. I'd love it.

263
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 Do you think that -- that Bonnie is the -- is the big tripping point because of Bonnie's hatred for you?

264
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 Do you think that could be part of it?

265
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 She just doesn't want me in charge of the meals.

266
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 Ah, that's good.

267
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 She just wants to make sure that Brian's eating salads and stuff like that.

268
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 Sarah's married to that guy? Jesus.

269
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 She basically said, "Don't eat all of Brian's food if I go." She said, "Don't."

270
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 Now, Matt, Brian needs to eat too.

271
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 Leave some --

272
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 You take care of him on the road.

273
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 Leave some food for Brian.

274
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 Brian eats first. #BrianEatsFirst.

275
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 You know who else eats first before Brian Brushwood? And that is the following sponsor.

276
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 Today's show, "Matt and Manny's Ice Cream Social," is brought to you by -- oh, man.

277
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 I just got a text as I went to look for the commercial thing.

278
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 No, no!

279
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 And it's distracting.

280
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 No, I'm back on board.

281
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 This is from Chasing the Dragon in 2025.

282
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 "Rim Tobin's 3-day course on infinite wealth, extreme health, and super sexiness."

283
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:02,500
 That's Rim Tobin's 3-day course on infinite wealth, extreme health, and super sexiness.

284
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 I feel like this is a bit on Jim Jobin.

285
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 Hey, everyone.

286
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 Oh, it must be. It's Rim Tobin here.

287
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 I'd like to advise you on how you can make your life better, faster, and stronger in every single way.

288
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 Are you looking for that perfect sexual partner?

289
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 Are you hunting for that great job that will bring you wealth but also give you time for a life-work balance?

290
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 Are you also looking to get a 90-foot penis?

291
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 I can do all of these things.

292
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 Yes, the 90-foot penis is the number one thing.

293
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 First, get the 90-foot penis.

294
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 Everything else falls into place.

295
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 If you get a 90-foot penis, then you will get a job.

296
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 Someone will hire you to be the guy with the 90-foot penis.

297
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,500
 You can stand at the top of a mountain and drop the 90-foot penis down, and people will just watch it, right?

298
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
 And people will pay you.

299
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 That will be your job.

300
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 Now, as far as sexual gratification, a 90-foot penis is very difficult to actually get erect.

301
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 That's what people won't tell you about the 90-foot penis.

302
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 It's really hard to get enough blood into a 90-foot penis to get it erect.

303
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 It's not impossible, though.

304
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 It's not impossible.

305
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
 What we've figured out is that...

306
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 I don't fuck people.

307
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 I repel them.

308
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
 No, we can use...

309
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 Like, you know, we talked about slap-cooking a chicken.

310
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 Well, this could be used for that.

311
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 You can just whip that clip.

312
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 Boom.

313
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 It's 90-foot.

314
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 Oops.

315
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 Oops.

316
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 How did you cook this chicken?

317
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 Via mushroom stamp.

318
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 Two problems.

319
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 Two problems with the 90-foot penis.

320
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 First of all, it is nearly needle-thick, so girth is gone.

321
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 Girth is completely gone.

322
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 Just like those taffy strings.

323
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 Yes.

324
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 Oh, no!

325
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 It's going to get tangled.

326
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 It looks like basically somebody pulled out hair gel and just kept going.

327
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 I knew when the genie winked, I would regret my decision.

328
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 That's it.

329
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 So there is no girth at all.

330
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 It's sort of like one of those filaments that they use for optic cable.

331
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 So that's problem number one.

332
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 Problem number two, of course, if you do get hard, it will exsanguinate your entire body.

333
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 Everyone buckle up because we know there are 11 problems.

334
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 That's one of the things we have to explain away, 11 problems with this.

335
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 There are only two.

336
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 Only two problems.

337
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
 Only two.

338
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 They didn't pay for enough ad space for 11.

339
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,500
 Fiber optic thickness and exsanguination.

340
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 That's it.

341
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 Rin Tobin.

342
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 That's it.

343
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 That made me think of the Mummy and the Skeksis.

344
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 I guess there's going to be another Mummy movie, which is exciting to me.

345
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 Starring Brendan Fraser?

346
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.

347
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 Oh, they're bringing back the original team.

348
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 They're both on board.

349
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 I was definitely being sarcastic.

350
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 They're actually bringing them back, though.

351
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 They're bringing them back.

352
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 Did they do that Tom Cruise Mummy movie thing that they tried that one time?

353
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 That whole thing.

354
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 Where Tom Cruise rewrote the whole thing in editing and that it was just really not understandable at all?

355
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 Dark Universe did not take off.

356
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 What were there, three movies in that Dark Universe that just all failed to show?

357
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 We don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

359
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 That was their whole plan.

360
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 It was a Universal Monster reboot.

361
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,500
 They were trying to do a Marvel Super Heroes thing, and they called it Dark Universe.

362
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 Oh, that's right.

363
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 They were going to do all of the classic Universal stuff.

364
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
 I forgot about that.

365
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 It was Mummy and Wolfman, which was Benicio del Toro.

366
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 And then what was the one with fighting around the world?

367
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
 What's his fucking name?

368
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 Oh, Russell Crowe.

369
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 Guy Ritchie?

370
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 No, Russell Crowe.

371
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 Russell Crowe, fighting around the world.

372
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 I'm Russell Crowe, fighting around the world.

373
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 That was Piff the Magic Dragon for a second.

374
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 No, it was Russell Crowe.

375
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 Russell Crowe did...

376
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 Which one did he do?

377
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 I don't know.

378
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 Buddy, you just keep laying these out.

379
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 We're not in them.

380
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 It's part of the cinematic world.

381
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
 Anyway, he might have also been in the Wolfman thing.

382
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 I don't fucking know.

383
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 But anyway, they only got two or three of them down.

384
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 Oh, he was Hyde and the Mummy.

385
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 That's it.

386
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 Okay, so he was going to be a Jekyll and Hyde, but it never happened.

387
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 Anyway, yeah, it all just shit.

388
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 It all fell apart real fast.

389
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 These people trying to make these big, you know, cinematic universes.

390
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 It's lightning in a bottle.

391
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 We talked about it before.

392
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 You're never going to get the same thing that Marvel got, which is not going to happen.

393
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 Well, this, you know, people complain about superheroes and blah, blah, blah, blah.

394
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 The bottom line is that years from now when we're studying films, from Iron Man to Endgame will be one of the greatest achievements of a movie studio ever.

395
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 Oh, it's incredible.

396
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 They had more success with that run of films than most movie studios ever have.

397
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 Yeah.

398
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 And they were the first thing of like, oh, would it be cool if all these movies built up to one big movie with all of the stars and stuff?

399
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 Yeah.

400
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 And it just never was able to be pulled off.

401
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 But you're seeing a lot of different types of movies come out now.

402
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 You know, so, you know, even with your horrors from your sinners to your weapons, at first we thought horror movies were done because no one was going to see them.

403
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 But now they seem to be punching up.

404
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 And now you're just seeing, you know, weird movies like One Battle After Another and then, you know, whatever the Channing Tatum with a guy stuck inside the store movies coming out like we're seeing like real swings for like different types of movies.

405
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 Well, Matt, you see the Aziz and Zari Keanu Reeves movie.

406
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 Oh, yeah.

407
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 I did see something.

408
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 Oh, and what's his name's in that, too, right?

409
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 Seth Rogen.

410
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 Seth Rogen.

411
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 Yeah.

412
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 I am.

413
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:33,500
 I'm sorry to say, Matt, that first movie I've seen in forever in the theaters I saw with you.

414
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 And unfortunately, our contribution to that film's box office numbers did not did not move the needle.

415
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 Fortunately, our contribution to that film's box office is measurable.

416
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 Yeah, I guess that's true.

417
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
 They can count our dollars.

418
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 The math is easy to do.

419
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 They can absolutely count our dollars.

420
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 We know how much we contributed to that box office.

421
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
 Good Lord.

422
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 On a percentage level, we could measure what we did.

423
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
 That movie lost so much fucking money.

424
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 Well, it came out on the month where everyone dumps movies.

425
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,500
 Right, but like this is the worst October in recorded history or something like that?

426
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 Yeah.

427
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 So yeah.

428
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 If you look at what it takes to make people go to the movie theaters.

429
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 Oh, yeah.

430
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 That's what I'm saying.

431
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
 Like I don't ever go any none of the boxes.

432
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 I haven't gone in front.

433
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
 Holy shit.

434
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 I'm looking up the numbers.

435
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 Springs.

436
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
 They deliver me from nowhere right now.

437
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 Uh huh.

438
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 Yeah, it's a bad one.

439
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 The latest dailies.

440
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 The opening day was eight point eight million dollars.

441
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
 Yeah.

442
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 That's a lot of money.

443
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 Not for a major film.

444
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 What did it cost, Jacob?

445
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 That was eight point eight million dollars over almost thirty five hundred theaters.

446
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 You know, they should have done, you know, like what Kevin Smith did with Red State.

447
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 I can't find the budget yet.

448
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 I'm looking for budget.

449
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 Yes.

450
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 You know, Kevin Smith at first just went out and did screenings and Q&A and sold tickets that were higher than movie price tickets to go just kind of check that out.

451
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 And then once it made.

452
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
 He did a big podcast junket on that one.

453
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 He was on like a Corolla's podcast when it was brand new back in the day promoting that.

454
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 Yeah, you're right.

455
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 Like Springsteen, if you noticed, he showed up everywhere to promote this movie.

456
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 Every event that they had, especially played a few songs and people went nuts and all that stuff.

457
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 They should have done like a marquee theater tour of the of the of the movie.

458
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 And then you have spring scene there.

459
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,500
 He gets to talk with more humor and three dimensionality about his battles with depression.

460
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 And then we don't feel like we just watched one giant downer.

461
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
 You know what I think?

462
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 I think they should have made a different movie.

463
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 I already know I would have rewrote the movie.

464
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 I mean, it was shit compared to compared to what you've told me about him.

465
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 Even just like what Matt has told better stories about Bruce.

466
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 That's what I'm saying, like as soon as as soon as he told me that that lady was an amalgamation.

467
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 I might get the fuck out of here.

468
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,500
 I don't understand. I don't understand at all.

469
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:14,500
 Oh, I'm going to make up this lady that I had a relationship with and I'm going to come out looking like a fucking bag of dicks.

470
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 I'm going to look worse than almost anyone in filmic history.

471
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 That relationship, he just looks like garbage.

472
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 There's a legendary story of Jersey Boys when they're trying to get it made.

473
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 Right. And they sent a script over to Frankie Valley and didn't hear from him for a while.

474
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 And then finally they tracked him down and were like, Frankie, we're trying to get you.

475
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,500
 You know, we're trying to get the final sign off on this version, you know, the script for the musical.

476
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 And he goes, you can't do it.

477
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,500
 And they said, what? And he goes, you can't you can't you can't make this musical.

478
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 And they said, why? He goes, because some of the stuff in it, I don't I don't I don't like.

479
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
 And they go, what don't you like? We'll change it.

480
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 And he goes, I don't know.

481
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 And they're like, what do you mean? You don't know.

482
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 And they go, you guys faxed it over.

483
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 My wife read it first.

484
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 She saw stuff in there she didn't like and she shredded it and put it in the garbage.

485
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 Oh, boy. Do you think that's what happened? Do you think Frankie Valley's wife shredded the script before Bruce could read it?

486
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 I'm saying someone should have set that movie script to Paddy Ski Alpha before Bruce got to read it, is what I'm saying.

487
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,500
 Fucking shit. Well, Philip, the SC scoop is saying they should have Muppets in it.

488
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 I think if you went back and reshot the Bruce elements or just did away, found a way to CG Kermit in for Bruce, man, it could be really, really funny.

489
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 That would be a knockdown, hilarious movie.

490
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,500
 If it's just Kermit being Bruce. Yeah, it's just Kermit the frog going through all that shit.

491
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 Oh, my dad hit me. Oh, God, the managers, both Bunsen and Beaker.

492
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 Oh, boy.

493
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 No, it has to be from this eight track cassette.

494
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 You don't understand. No, the sound just isn't there.

495
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 It just isn't there. Oh, I'm sorry, Piggy.

496
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,500
 I have to leave you here next to the dishwasher and moved to California.

497
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 There's no way. Oh, oh, you bitch.

498
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 I'm leaving this one. Dishwasher crumples billows with smoke.

499
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,500
 Gonzo pops out of the top with a chicken.

500
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 You guys don't understand that the artistic force behind Nebraska.

501
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,500
 All of the electric mayhem is basically out of focus in the studio shots and no one cares.

502
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 Yeah, nobody would care. No, it doesn't seem to bother anyone at all.

503
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:52,500
 Listen, someone who's still down about twenty five million dollars right now with the worldwide gross, not counting advertising budget.

504
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 So far, they've lost about twenty five million dollars and flying in, putting a Bruce for all these public appearances, probably doesn't cost that much.

505
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 But that's probably very inexpensive.

506
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 But as someone who is this huge Springsteen fan, I it did cause the release of this Nebraska 82 album.

507
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
 Which is great. It is awesome.

508
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 It's a four disc album and one of them is just him rerecording the entire thing with his voice as it is now as an old man.

509
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:29,500
 Yeah, hey, little is your daddy home to go and it's my favorite thing that I've listened to in a while.

510
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 I got a bad desire.

511
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 Oh, Fozzie's fired. Sorry, Fozzie.

512
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 Hey there, Scooter, is it time for work?

513
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 You better tell us on time, you jerk. Oh, yeah, I got a bad desire.

514
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 What do you call the East Street band selling Christmas decorations around the holidays?

515
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 I don't know. Tell me, big man.

516
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 Bruce Springsteen. That's pretty good.

517
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,500
 That's that's that joke alone is better than the movie.

518
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,500
 Matt Donnelly has a better Fozzie the bear impression than I would have guessed.

519
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 It's really good. It's very solid, pretty solid, very solid.

520
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 Well, it would make sense that he would have a good Fozzie to my Kermit.

521
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
 That's right. That's true.

522
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 There you go. That's right.

523
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 Now we now we have another bit we can do in our shows.

524
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,500
 Now if we play Pollywood Squares, I'll pop over one of those squares.

525
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
 No, Miss Piggy wouldn't have put up with Bruce's shit.

526
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
 That's right. Oh, yeah, yeah.

527
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 First time he's like, I'm depressed and answering the calls.

528
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:41,500
 Miss Piggy be kicking in that door and karate chopping at four track player.

529
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 I'm out of here, frog.

530
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 I have things to do. This is bullshit.

531
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,500
 I mean, as we listen, I don't know how many more people tuned into this this this this Zoom.

532
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,500
 I'm much more famous than I was yesterday.

533
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 What happened?

534
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 I went on San Antonio Live and performed a magic trick for the morning host.

535
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 Oh, that's nice. How did it go?

536
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,500
 You did the whole. This was like a like a morning.

537
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 Good morning. Whatever town show.

538
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 Yes. Good morning, San Antonio.

539
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 San Antonio Live is a good morning San Antonio show.

540
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
 And it's my second time doing it.

541
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,500
 The first time I didn't talk about on there because I basically almost fucked up both tricks I did.

542
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
 And I just was like it just was pretty pretty mediocre appearance,

543
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
 except that I was funny and didn't help sell out the rest of the week because I was funny.

544
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,500
 Oh, that's good.

545
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
 This time, is this your card? You're doing the cups and balls, sir.

546
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,500
 So what they do is they have you come on and do like, hey, if you have a quick teaser trick, you can do a quick trick.

547
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,500
 And then go to commercial break and then do a real trick with you when you come back.

548
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 Right. OK. And so last time I was there, I had like what I thought was a quick trick.

549
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 And they were like a mega tease.

550
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,500
 And they're going to do like me plus someone there for a dog shelter,

551
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,500
 plus someone there advertising their new store or something like that in town. Right.

552
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,500
 And so we're all lined up and I'm doing this card trick as fast as I can.

553
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 And something I'm taking up all the time.

554
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,500
 And they have to I get I get I get the punch line of the trick in just the last second.

555
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:25,500
 They cut the commercial and I just stare at the person who's been just holding this giant dog in their arms waiting.

556
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
 So sorry.

557
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,500
 And so Matt adopted that dog out of guilt.

558
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
 And so now Matt has a Mr. Biffles.

559
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,500
 So this time I'm there and I have this like pencil, I can put a pencil through a bill and it looks like I rip it and put a hole in it and boom, boom, boom.

560
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
 It's all it's the dollar is fine. Right.

561
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:51,500
 But I literally was like turned to my friend Mia, who drove me down to the root, the manager here.

562
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
 I said, tie me on this.

563
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
 And and I did it as fast as I could.

564
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,500
 And she's like twenty eight seconds and I was like, I won't do it that fast on air to try to talk.

565
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
 So that one's out.

566
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,500
 Oh, the time for the old miracle harmonica sounds.

567
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
 All right. Perfect.

568
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 I just grabbed her little index card.

569
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
 She's reading her facts off me and I made it magically sound like harmonica and handed it back to her.

570
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
 We went to commercial break. No problem.

571
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,500
 This is nice and easy.

572
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:32,500
 I get down there, Brian, it turns out Brian Brushwood is about to start selling the harmonica trick, the invisible harmonica trick on.

573
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
 Oh, good.

574
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
 Because I because I need one of these.

575
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:44,500
 He was like, and so I just talked to him today and he's like, he's like, hey, are you willing to film a testimonial?

576
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,500
 I was like, am I? I've just been doing I've been doing a testimonial for some magic trick for months.

577
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
 The fact that you could profit from it's even better.

578
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 Yeah.

579
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
 I think it's funny because the reason why Brian might be selling this probably because it's ruined popularity.

580
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,500
 And I really think I am instrumental in the popularity of this magic trick.

581
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,500
 You are definitely you have created a cult following for this magic trick for sure.

582
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
 I really have.

583
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,500
 Like I don't often take credit for things, but this one is like I definitely blew it up at Magic Live and sold it out at Magic Live.

584
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:26,500
 And that's kind of created a wave of people using it or talking about it in magic circles that something they're using looking for more places to sell it.

585
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
 They approach Brian.

586
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
 So all right.

587
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
 New business idea.

588
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,500
 Every Magic Live, Matt decides what new trick is going to be the huge new seller.

589
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
 We then sell said trick.

590
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 Matt Donnelly, the kingmaker.

591
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
 Yeah.

592
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
 This one looks like your nose is made out of rubber and it stretches out and snaps back.

593
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
 All right.

594
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
 Like a rubber booger?

595
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
 You pull a stretchy booger out of your nose?

596
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,500
 Stretchy booger is the worst clown I ever hired.

597
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 Stretchy booger? He was?

598
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
 Aww.

599
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
 Hi Matt.

600
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
 Oh, stretchy booger.

601
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
 Whoa, stretchy booger.

602
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
 That was out of your pants.

603
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
 I know.

604
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
 You have some new material.

605
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
 Oh, what material?

606
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,500
 I'm afraid you've moved on from snot to some other kind of material.

607
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
 Foreskin.

608
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
 Foreskin?

609
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 Yours is more like fiveskin.

610
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
 Did you have some kind of 90 foot penis going on in there?

611
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
 Good lord.

612
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
 Yes, but it's very thin.

613
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
 Oh, yes.

614
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
 I see.

615
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
 Oh, I have to make a long distance phone call.

616
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
 Can I use some of your fiber optic cock?

617
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
 No.

618
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
 Don't get roaming charges.

619
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:50,500
 Oh, that's the least of my worries with your wiener.

620
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
 You know who else thinks I have a dirty wiener?

621
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
 That's the following sponsor.

622
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 Today's show, Matt and Manny's Ice Cream Social, is brought to you by Big Jerry's House of Hoarding.

623
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 That's right.

624
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
 Store all your collectibles with me, Big Jerry.

625
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
 That's from Dead Lazlo in 2022.

626
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
 Hey everybody, it's Big Jerry. How's it going?

627
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,500
 Somebody bring me some more cake.

628
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
 Hey, anyway.

629
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,500
 Come on over to my house of hoarding.

630
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,500
 I've got nothing but places to put stuff and places to leave it.

631
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,500
 If you've got something you don't want anymore in your house, come on and bring it by.

632
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,500
 It'll be fine.

633
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:46,500
 Oh, I just had a bunch of magazines fall over and kill another cat.

634
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
 And her hay scoops a check.

635
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
 Oh, that was my cat.

636
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
 Meow.

637
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
 Big Jerry.

638
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
 That's a big guy.

639
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
 Big Jerry.

640
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
 Big Jerry.

641
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:08,500
 So I did a bit I did when I do close-up, which is one of my favorite kinds of tricks for you.

642
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,500
 Look at an envelope I put in my pocket. They pick a card.

643
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,500
 Suddenly I'm not holding cards in my hand. I'm holding the envelope and in my pocket is all the cards.

644
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,500
 And then boom, inside the envelope is their card. It's a miracle.

645
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,500
 Something goes wrong with TV magic no matter what.

646
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:36,500
 I described, almost messing up the last time I was on, even when I did the arm chopper, it got caught for a second and then went through and it was a moment of panic.

647
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:44,500
 I'm trying to troubleshoot, I'm trying to brace them, all the little things that go wrong with this. There's a lot of little touches to this trick.

648
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,500
 Anything that happens in plain sight, so to speak.

649
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,500
 I'm anticipating all of it.

650
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:58,500
 And then I just go to get the card out of the pocket and I just can't get the card out of the envelope.

651
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:06,500
 I'm just sitting there like, pick, pick, pick, pick, just jammed in there, just can't.

652
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,500
 It's an envelope that's like the size of a playing card, right?

653
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,500
 Yeah, exact size of a playing card.

654
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,500
 And so I'm trying to slide it out and I'm just like, oh, all the days.

655
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:26,500
 The only thing that's going wrong is the actual punchline of the trick, the actual payoff, that's the only thing being delayed here.

656
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,500
 I'm picturing dropping all the cards on the ground by accident. I'm trying to picture it accidentally.

657
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,500
 I've done this thing where I've accidentally pocketed the whole thing where I'm supposed to keep a gimmick in my hand.

658
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,500
 I put everything in my pocket like a fool. All kinds of things.

659
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,500
 And then it's like, oh, it's going good, it's going good.

660
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
 You forgot to grease up your card.

661
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,500
 I forgot to grease up my card. Yeah, I got to butter up my envelope.

662
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,500
 Well, everybody forgets something once in a while.

663
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:02,500
 I had a little bit of time off after our trip to decompress.

664
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,500
 And so I've been trying to, you know, just kind of straighten up the house a little bit here and there, got some stuff done.

665
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
 You do look very decompressed.

666
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:20,500
 I feel decompressed. But I went out and cleaned up the Halloween decorations.

667
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,500
 Nice. And I was like, you know what? I better put the Christmas decorations out or they're not going out.

668
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,500
 And I did it. I got the Christmas decorations out the same day.

669
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
 Whoa! Wait, you've decorated for Christmas?

670
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,500
 We are already decorated for Christmas. We've got our five illuminated corgis.

671
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
 It's not crazy. It's not a big thing.

672
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:49,500
 It's just five illuminated corgis and a little strobe laser that shoots on the house and makes sparkly Christmas colors.

673
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,500
 And that's it. All right. Yeah, done.

674
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,500
 And it's running? It's all cooked and lit?

675
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,500
 Our neighbors across the street still have all their Halloween shit up.

676
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,500
 I was like, I did it. I beat them to the punch.

677
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:14,500
 And what's cool is now driving through the neighborhood, this is four days later, three days later, since I got my stuff set up.

678
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,500
 I'm starting to see other trees. I'm starting to see wreaths on doors.

679
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
 Oh, you started it. You started the Domino Hall day.

680
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:26,500
 I put the word out. I was like, it's on this year, y'all. Let's go. Let's put it up.

681
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:34,500
 And I also... Did I tell you guys about... The things that you two have influence over. Magic tricks and Christmas decorations.

682
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,500
 Did I tell you guys about the goose that Ann got last year?

683
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
 Yes. She refurbished it, right?

684
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,500
 No, that was the gnome. So this was a goose.

685
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,500
 Ann had always wanted a big old concrete goose because it's just one of those things, right?

686
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
 Oh, thank God it's concrete.

687
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,500
 But what can you do with a concrete goose except dress it up, right?

688
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
 That's the whole thing, is you have a goose.

689
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,500
 What can you do with a concrete goose? What can you do with a concrete goose?

690
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,500
 What can you do with a concrete goose? I can put a hat on it.

691
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:11,500
 That's right. Well, I finally got the set of costumes for the goose.

692
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
 So now...

693
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
 How does one shop for goose costumes?

694
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:29,500
 Go online and type in "costumes for goose" and you will get unlimited replies because people dress up their goose all the time.

695
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
 It comes up quick and easy. Jacob's going to the internet.

696
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,500
 Oh, wow. It's up. There's a lot of costumes for goose.

697
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:44,500
 And so I looked and found a reasonably priced set and I went for it and it has not let me down.

698
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 Yeah. As a matter of fact, I believe...

699
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
 Yeah, I purchased one...

700
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
 No, I didn't go there. That's just one.

701
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
 That's just one costume. That's high end right there.

702
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
 That's a Piff the Magic Dragon goose.

703
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,500
 Yeah, that's pretty great.

704
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
 It's a Goose the Magic Dragon.

705
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:09,500
 Well, our goose now has full different stuff for every holiday.

706
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,500
 So I already did the pumpkin on it, did a jack-o-lantern.

707
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,500
 It was outfitted with a turkey. Now it's a goose that looks like a turkey.

708
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:23,500
 Also, the goose is named Duck Duck. That's the goose's name. Duck Duck the Goose.

709
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,500
 So Duck Duck was actually...

710
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,500
 He is our memento from the Michael's Craft Store where we bought it.

711
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:41,500
 And it's just one more sort of emblem of the fall of capitalism and the end of all brick and mortar mom and pop shops.

712
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,500
 So, yeah.

713
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,500
 So it's a turkey now? Do you already know what you're going to do for Christmas?

714
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,500
 Oh, yeah. He's got a Santa outfit.

715
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,500
 He's got a Santa outfit. Then he's got a winter snowflake for January.

716
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,500
 Then he's got a big heart for February.

717
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,500
 Then he's got a leprechaun suit for March.

718
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
 Oh, God. There we go.

719
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:14,500
 April, I don't think there's anything like April, May. I think it kind of gets sparse.

720
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
 July, he's got a...

721
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
 Oh, come on, Matty Glee.

722
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,500
 I'm telling you, it's only so many costumes.

723
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
 We need April and May.

724
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
 Easter Bunny.

725
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
 Oh, I'm sorry. There is an Easter Bunny. There's an Easter Bunny.

726
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,500
 There's a Fourth of July Uncle Sam.

727
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:37,500
 And for May, you should dress it up either as a stormtrooper for May the Fourth Be With You.

728
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
 Yeah. Oh, that's good.

729
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,500
 Or may dress it up like Justin Timberlake.

730
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,500
 Just staple some ramen to its head.

731
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,500
 God, that guy fell off so hard.

732
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
 Nah, he's great.

733
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,500
 What a chump. No, he's a chump. He's a chump. He's the definition of chump.

734
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
 Come at me, Timberlake, you chump.

735
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
 We actually didn't talk about Halloween yet, did we?

736
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:08,500
 No, I was about to ask you about Trunk or Treat. Trunk or Treat and Trick and Or Treat.

737
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
 Oh, man.

738
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
 I think we talked about Trunk or Treat already.

739
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,500
 Trunk or Treat, we talked about it, yeah.

740
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,500
 I had an awesome Halloween, so my sister-in-law came up.

741
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,500
 She brought a big old bunch of Dum Dum suckers, and we had enough candy.

742
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
 We only had about a hundred...

743
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
 You said, "No, I'm already here."

744
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:28,500
 We only had about a hundred Trunk or Treaters, which was down from previous years, but it's still a lot.

745
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
 Oh, you know, tariffs.

746
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:37,500
 Dude. And then we surprised her, and we went right after the Trick or Treaters were done.

747
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,500
 We put everything away, and we jumped in the car and ran to the Pittsburgh Zoo,

748
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,500
 which was having their Halloween Jack-o-Lantern Festival.

749
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
 Okay.

750
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,500
 Jack-o-Lantern Extravaganza. I believe this is like the third annual one that they did.

751
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
 It's like a giant ookie-cookie, but with pumpkins?

752
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,500
 It was remarkable. This thing was incredible.

753
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,500
 They had thousands and thousands of Jack-o-Lanterns throughout the zoo.

754
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,500
 It was wild.

755
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
 Okay.

756
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,500
 You could get pictures taken.

757
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
 There was a witch.

758
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,500
 Paul has pictures of various Jack-o-Lanterns.

759
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,500
 There's my spooky picture of our house. It turned out really good.

760
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
 I'm going the wrong way here.

761
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,500
 But yeah, there's me doing the classic with a skeleton doing the classic.

762
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
 Okay.

763
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:38,500
 They did these really ornate Jack-o-Lanterns sculpted by hand, and it turns out they had like 30.

764
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,500
 What you're showing me is not sculpted by hand.

765
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,500
 It is.

766
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
 No.

767
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
 It is.

768
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
 What's that Pittsburgh sign?

769
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,500
 Dude, these are cut out by artisans.

770
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
 It's like carved into a pumpkin.

771
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,500
 Yes.

772
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,500
 It looks like somebody just put a picture on top of a pumpkin and it's lit up, but it's like carved into it.

773
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
 It is carved into it.

774
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,500
 They do use a stencil, but then they carve.

775
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,500
 But yeah, there's like a marker for some of the darker stuff on it to make it really...

776
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:14,500
 But there are like 30 artisans carving these fucking pumpkins every day.

777
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,500
 And because it's the zoo, there's a lot of animals.

778
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,500
 But it is wild. It is fucking wild.

779
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
 It is incredible.

780
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
 It's really beautiful.

781
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,500
 I'm just wondering how much more care the animals could have gotten instead of taking all this time to carve these fucking pumpkins.

782
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
 The animals are all away.

783
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
 There were no animals out.

784
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:38,500
 The only animals we saw were some flamingos that were sleeping in their own little thing.

785
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
 The worst zoo ever.

786
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,500
 Jules and Vincent.

787
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,500
 Pulp Fiction.

788
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,500
 Pulp Fiction.

789
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
 Yeah, it was really cool.

790
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
 It was amazing.

791
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,500
 And I didn't even get any images of the grand finale.

792
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
 It was too overwhelming.

793
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:07,500
 There had to have been, I don't know, 10,000 fucking LED filled jack-o-lanterns that were timed out to music.

794
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,500
 And they were playing shit like Renegade and stuff.

795
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
 And it was all timed out to the music.

796
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,500
 I'm telling you, it was out of hand.

797
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
 They were playing Renegade.

798
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,500
 They were playing Renegade and it was timed out to the music.

799
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
 Yeah, Renegade by Sticks.

800
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
 Yeah.

801
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
 I believe that's the right word.

802
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
 The word is out.

803
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
 Is that how it goes?

804
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,500
 Yeah.

805
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
 The word is out.

806
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
 They finally found me.

807
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
 Yeah.

808
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500
 I'm a wanted man.

809
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
 I'm a wanted pumpkin.

810
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
 Yeah, it was out of hand.

811
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,500
 And it was just this huge wall that stretched for like a half a mile.

812
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,500
 It was nuts.

813
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
 It was extremely cool.

814
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
 That was pumpkins.

815
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
 It was pumpkins.

816
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,500
 The kinds of things, if you get a chance to look up the Pittsburgh Pumpkin Extravaganza,

817
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,500
 just go ahead and look it up anywhere.

818
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,500
 But the Pittsburgh Zoo Pumpkin Extravaganza, there are...

819
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
 Do not look it up at work.

820
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,500
 It is much dirtier than you think it is.

821
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
 There is some NSFW stuff in there.

822
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,500
 No, it was really, really cool.

823
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
 It was good.

824
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
 It was, I mean, like really, really fun.

825
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,500
 And we went just at the last two hours of the show and it was nice and dark.

826
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,500
 And so everything was super shiny in the light.

827
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,500
 And then Ann kept telling me, "No, these are real pumpkins."

828
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,500
 I was like, "Nah, these are plastic."

829
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
 Because a lot of them were plastic.

830
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,500
 But then she was like, "No, these are real.

831
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
 These are real."

832
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,500
 And I was like, "Bullshit."

833
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:36,500
 Turns out every three days they have to reshave those pumpkins because they go south of cheese.

834
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:41,500
 And so they got artisans in there just cranking out pumpkins all the time.

835
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,500
 I am so far out on that gig.

836
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:53,500
 And they have a huge crew of artists going and sculpting these pumpkins every fucking year, every fucking couple days.

837
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
 It was wild.

838
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
 It was wild.

839
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
 Oh, that is painful.

840
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:08,500
 And just like you, Matt, the guy who is the head gourd carver made an appearance on Pittsburgh Today Live or whatever it is.

841
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,500
 And he was on there showing off his pumpkin carving skills.

842
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
 So yeah, it was really something.

843
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,500
 So I had a really fun Halloween.

844
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,500
 Oh, great.

845
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
 Yeah.

846
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
 That's awesome.

847
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:27,500
 Also, like Matt, there was a guy trying to have a dog get adopted just off camera while the guy was carving the pumpkin.

848
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
 They ran out of time.

849
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,500
 They had so much good shit at this pumpkin fair.

850
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:37,500
 They had a big s'mores spot with an open fire.

851
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
 I know.

852
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,500
 Six people from my show showed up at the pumpkin patch.

853
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
 They left my show and went over there.

854
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
 Well, they were excited.

855
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
 They had s'mores to eat.

856
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
 They had s'mores reservations?

857
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
 Shit.

858
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
 Holy shit.

859
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
 I'm sorry.

860
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
 We have reservations for s'mores in Pittsburgh.

861
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,500
 It's only about a 25 minute drive from my house to get to the zoo.

862
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,500
 So that was really great and really fun.

863
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
 Are you going to start frequenting the zoo more often?

864
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,500
 We've gone for a couple special events now.

865
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
 And so I think we'll continue to do so.

866
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,500
 They put on a real fun show.

867
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
 Yeah.

868
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
 All right.

869
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:21,500
 I was overwhelmed by the amount of work and detail and fun that went into that pumpkin display.

870
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
 I thought it was going to be ho-hum, but it was really...

871
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,500
 I mean, I'm overwhelmed by your description of it.

872
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
 So I can just imagine how you feel.

873
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
 I wish I had it handy.

874
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:40,500
 But if you get a chance, please look up Pittsburgh Zoo Jack O'Lantern Extravaganza.

875
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,500
 Do not look it up at work.

876
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,500
 And just look up that finale.

877
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
 Yeah.

878
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
 It's a very quick URL.

879
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,500
 Falls very easy call to action.

880
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:02,500
 Pittsburgh Zoo, pumpkin, Extravaganza, finale, LED, timed out wall, renegade.

881
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,500
 Yeah.

882
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,500
 .org.

883
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
 That's how you got to look up.

884
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
 .org.

885
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,500
 But it was amazing.

886
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,500
 Just amazing.

887
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:14,500
 It's one of those things that when you're there, I purposely was like, I'm not recording

888
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,500
 this.

889
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
 I'm not taking pictures of this part.

890
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
 I'm just going to experience this.

891
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
 And it was really, really cool.

892
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,500
 Rich Scoop in chat says, do not go to pittsburghblumpkins.com.

893
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,500
 Oh, that's our new Patreon site.

894
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
 Oh, shit.

895
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:40,500
 Speaking of pittsburghblumpkins.com, you remember we gave away with our prizes galore, we had

896
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,500
 some dude wipes that were holiday themed.

897
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
 Pumpkin scented dude wipes.

898
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
 Yeah, they were pumpkin spice dude wipes.

899
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
 They were dumpkin spice.

900
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500
 That was the whole thing.

901
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
 Dumpkin spice.

902
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:56,500
 Well, they've got a new flavor coming out for the holidays that we just started getting

903
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
 in at the Tarzai.

904
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
 Oh, no.

905
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
 Dingleberry.

906
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,500
 What?

907
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:07,500
 Dingleberry dude wipes are the holiday version.

908
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
 And they're Christmas themed?

909
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:15,500
 They're Christmas themed and they're called Dingleberry.

910
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
 Oh, jeez.

911
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
 It's kind of nasty.

912
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
 I'm mad that they're skipping Thanksgiving.

913
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
 I want stuffing scented wipes.

914
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
 Stuffing scented wipes.

915
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
 Oh.

916
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
 Nice cranberry sauce.

917
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
 It'd be cranberry.

918
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,500
 C-R-A-M.

919
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
 Cranberry.

920
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
 Cranberry.

921
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,500
 You can just jab them up there.

922
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
 Just call it giblets.

923
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,500
 Oh.

924
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,500
 It's better than fucking jingle balls or whatever the fuck they actually are using.

925
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
 Dingle bells.

926
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
 Yeah, giblets is better.

927
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
 Dingle bells.

928
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
 Dingle bells.

929
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,500
 Matt, you had a fuck ton of kids at your house the other day.

930
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,500
 Also, there was Halloween.

931
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
 You came during a rush.

932
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
 Jacob actually came by the place and we were running.

933
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
 I did.

934
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
 I ran by on my way to work.

935
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,500
 Jacob came by right when I had about nine kids line up for levitation videos.

936
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,500
 Oh, wow.

937
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
 Not happening throughout the whole night.

938
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,500
 But I did more levitation videos this year than last year.

939
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,500
 I think last year me dressed like Satan really discouraged some people from stepping up and doing it.

940
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:26,500
 And so this year I was dressed like Elvis and a bunch of parents got videos of their kids floating in the air with me running the hoop over their bodies and stuff.

941
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
 That's cute.

942
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,500
 I hung out with Matt's neighbor and we watched Matt doing the levitation videos.

943
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:40,500
 Matt around kids and their parents doing these videos.

944
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:47,500
 You can tell that Matt deals with school children on a regular basis.

945
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
 It is spectacular to watch.

946
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
 Yeah.

947
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
 One is I don't touch them.

948
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
 No, you don't touch.

949
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
 I noticed that.

950
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:00,500
 You don't touch the kids at all, which, you know, not how Paul would do it, but still fine.

951
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,500
 Well, I wouldn't talk to him.

952
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,500
 I get the fuck out of here.

953
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
 Get out of my yard, motherfucker.

954
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:13,500
 And then my buddy Tony was drunk with power running the clown jump scare.

955
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
 He was.

956
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
 So I think we last thought it was broken.

957
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,500
 My neighbor, Gary, and I helped Gary, who abbreviated my car together.

958
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:30,500
 He helped fix my clown illusion, and we discovered what happened, of course, was my fault.

959
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,500
 So there you go.

960
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,500
 So my buddy Tony's running the jump scare of my kids trick-or-treating.

961
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,500
 My kids like running the clown jump scare when they got back from trick-or-treating.

962
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,500
 Sure.

963
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,500
 I don't think, Jacob, you weren't there when my oldest got back from trick-or-treating, right?

964
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,500
 No, I was not.

965
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
 I didn't see your kids.

966
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,500
 The rule was basically don't jump scare little kids.

967
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,500
 Sure.

968
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,500
 Jump scare teens.

969
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,500
 And even that backfired.

970
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
 I tried to -- one kid I thought was older than he was, I made a kid cry.

971
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
 I gave him all of the candy.

972
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,500
 I just said, here, take any and all.

973
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,500
 One was a group of teenage girls.

974
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
 They came up.

975
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
 We jump scared them with the clown.

976
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,500
 And she literally just looked down and hugged herself.

977
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,500
 And then four friends said, okay, we're going.

978
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,500
 And the four friends just marched her off.

979
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,500
 It was the weirdest dramatic reaction.

980
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
 I am done.

981
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,500
 I'm done.

982
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,500
 I don't give a fuck.

983
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
 I sit out in my yard.

984
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,500
 I sit out in my place dressed up like a creepy fucking skeleton.

985
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,500
 I was going to say, Paul does get mad that people aren't scared at Halloween all the time.

986
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
 I do.

987
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
 It's a fucking scary holiday.

988
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,500
 It's supposed to be scary.

989
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
 It's about the dead.

990
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,500
 It's about the horrors.

991
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
 I get so mad.

992
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
 It's not Christmas.

993
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
 It's all a fucking ween.

994
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,500
 A couple of times we were going to go take a video of them levitating.

995
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
 And also the jump scare happened with the clown.

996
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,500
 And they went like, oh, wait, this is rigged.

997
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
 I'm leaving.

998
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,500
 And they pass on the levitation thing.

999
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
 And I'd be like, no, no, no.

1000
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,500
 So at one point, I was levitating people.

1001
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,500
 And then a kid jump scared.

1002
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,500
 And then all of a sudden, my kid goes back for trick-or-treating at the same time.

1003
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
 It's like a big hubbub in my driveway.

1004
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:19,500
 And then suddenly a little three-year-old starts walking towards the candy, which is right next to the clown.

1005
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,500
 Next to the jump scare, yeah.

1006
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
 That's next to the jump scare, yeah.

1007
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
 And the parents go, whoa, whoa.

1008
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
 And I go, no, no, no.

1009
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
 We will not jump scare the little kid.

1010
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,500
 Right?

1011
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,500
 No, no, no.

1012
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
 And then Tony, my buddy Tony, was also going like, no, no.

1013
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,500
 We're good.

1014
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
 Have her come get candy.

1015
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,500
 Yeah.

1016
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:34,500
 My son--

1017
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
 Because Tony was drunk with power on the jump scare.

1018
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
 But I was watching.

1019
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,500
 He was getting the big kids.

1020
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
 Yeah, yeah.

1021
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
 We were just doing the big kids.

1022
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
 Yeah, no.

1023
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,500
 So he-- and so we do that.

1024
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,500
 But my son doesn't see the little kid.

1025
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
 He only sees the teenagers behind the little kid.

1026
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,500
 Oh, no.

1027
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
 And he wasn't paying attention.

1028
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,500
 So he slides over.

1029
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,500
 So in front of a giant crowd, of which we-- me and Tony, both were going like, don't--

1030
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
 No, no, no.

1031
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
 You'll be fine.

1032
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,500
 You'll be fine.

1033
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
 Do the jump scare.

1034
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,500
 You'll be fine.

1035
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
 And then boom.

1036
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,500
 You like sex a bit.

1037
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,500
 And then the one horn blasts some three-year-old kid.

1038
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
 Yeah.

1039
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
 To which we all just turned to Keeler.

1040
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,500
 We're like, yeah.

1041
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,500
 Just screaming at him.

1042
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,500
 Your poor son, I'm sure, was just mortified by it.

1043
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
 He was like, what?

1044
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
 We pointed.

1045
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
 He was like, oh, I didn't see them.

1046
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
 The table was above.

1047
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,500
 I couldn't see the kid below the table.

1048
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,500
 And I was like, it was all we were talking about.

1049
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,500
 Yeah.

1050
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,500
 So that was maybe the low point of the clown jump scare there.

1051
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,500
 Oh, disagree.

1052
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
 Disagree.

1053
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,500
 Did you get-- did you see our giant skeleton?

1054
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,500
 Did you see our 12-foot skeleton?

1055
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:53,500
 You have, on your property, something that you now own is a giant skeleton.

1056
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,500
 Wow.

1057
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,500
 My sons are begging me to just put a Santa Claus hat on it and leave it up through the

1058
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
 holidays.

1059
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
 It's the way to go, man.

1060
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
 It's the right move.

1061
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,500
 They're right.

1062
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,500
 Really, it's got to be a 365 skeleton.

1063
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,500
 You make him 11.

1064
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
 Also, you don't have anywhere else to store it.

1065
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1066
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,500
 Oh, you got the HOA.

1067
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,500
 That's going to be trouble.

1068
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,500
 Yeah.

1069
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,500
 Yeah, I know.

1070
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,500
 Unless there's a bylaw in there that says what kind of decorations you can have out

1071
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,500
 for holidays.

1072
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,500
 I think you're safe.

1073
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:27,500
 So at the end of the day-- this is the first Halloween where I decided to calculate how

1074
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,500
 many pounds of candy I bought.

1075
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,500
 I used to just measure in bags, and then I cost-code myself, and it turns out I had bought

1076
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
 50 pounds of candy.

1077
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,500
 Oh, yeah.

1078
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,500
 There was a question in the chat earlier about how much of your giant haul of candy do you

1079
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,500
 still have remaining?

1080
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,500
 I was able to unload between truck and treat, which turned out truck and treat, they actually

1081
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
 offered candy for you to give out.

1082
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,500
 Damn it.

1083
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,500
 Which I was like, that's something I should know ahead of time.

1084
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
 I wish that had been in the email.

1085
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,500
 Instead, I refused to be subsidized by the government for my candy supply.

1086
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:06,500
 I decided to lift my own trunk up by the bootstraps and provide my own candy.

1087
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,500
 I was able to unload 30 pounds of candy.

1088
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,500
 Whoa.

1089
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,500
 That is no small amount of candy.

1090
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
 That was like-- normally, you start off with a candy.

1091
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,500
 You go like, oh, just take one.

1092
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
 And then all of a sudden, you realize how much candy you have.

1093
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,500
 You're like, go ahead, take more.

1094
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,500
 I had it.

1095
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,500
 I'm all-- from the beginning of Halloween to the end, I was like, grab a handful more.

1096
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,500
 Go for it.

1097
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,500
 Be selfish.

1098
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,500
 Be a jerk.

1099
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:39,500
 And still, I turned out 50 pounds of candy was too much candy to have.

1100
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
 So you're ready for next Halloween.

1101
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
 How much was left over?

1102
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,500
 20 pounds.

1103
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,500
 20 pounds of candy.

1104
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,500
 All right.

1105
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
 Are you going to take it to the food bank?

1106
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,500
 Yeah.

1107
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,500
 Food bank meaning my mouth.

1108
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,500
 Yeah.

1109
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,500
 That's right.

1110
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,500
 That's right.

1111
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
 Bank that food.

1112
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,500
 Bank it.

1113
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,500
 Go.

1114
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
 Go.

1115
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
 Yes.

1116
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,500
 So yes, I'm going to find a place to donate it.

1117
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,500
 I obviously go right up to San Antonio.

1118
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,500
 But I will find a place to donate candy when I get back.

1119
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,500
 Nice.

1120
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,500
 Yeah.

1121
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,500
 Funny thing, as a running bit, when it came up my house, I held up a bucket of candy, said,

1122
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,500
 trick or treat, just to keep giving it away.

1123
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
 And that was successful.

1124
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
 People still take candy when you offer it to them.

1125
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,500
 Oh, yeah, they will.

1126
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
 I was still unloading candy the next day.

1127
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:28,500
 I saw one of the best little TikToks I've seen in a long time was Black Barber Shop.

1128
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,500
 And the barber would get done with the haircut.

1129
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:38,500
 And then right before he takes the bib off, he'd grab a bucket of dumb, dumb suckers and offer a sucker to the client.

1130
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,500
 And the client would inevitably just crack up.

1131
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,500
 But then they'd take a sucker and they were loving it.

1132
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,500
 It was just the sweetest thing.

1133
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,500
 It was the nicest thing.

1134
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,500
 It's like we should offer each other candy in social situations much more often.

1135
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,500
 I remember, you know, when you went to your grandma's house, you got candy.

1136
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
 It wasn't a special day.

1137
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,500
 Exactly.

1138
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
 There's just such a dish.

1139
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,500
 We don't have such a dish for a reason.

1140
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
 Exactly right.

1141
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:12,500
 I think I need to keep a more active candy dish in my home that I specifically think about for guests, not just for me.

1142
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,500
 Yeah.

1143
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,500
 A guest dish.

1144
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,500
 A guest dish of candy.

1145
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,500
 Paul's stage in the world.

1146
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,500
 Not with the nasty stuff.

1147
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,500
 But he started his hero's journey.

1148
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,500
 I have, you know, I do this for the...

1149
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,500
 The biography will look back at this moment.

1150
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
 For the betterment of the world.

1151
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,500
 Rich Scoog, give me a good idea.

1152
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,500
 I should get in a white panel van, drive around, find kids who maybe don't have candy and offer them candy from my van.

1153
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:40,500
 Oh, that is, it's like a traveling food bank.

1154
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
 You know what ruined the candy dish?

1155
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,500
 Bitto honey.

1156
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
 Bitto honey ruined the candy dish.

1157
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,500
 That and that hard shit that just melds together into one candy glob.

1158
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,500
 Yeah.

1159
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,500
 That shit was nasty.

1160
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:59,500
 What my grandma had, which was great, was she had the little Kraft butterscotch squares.

1161
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
 Oh yeah, those are good.

1162
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,500
 Holy shit.

1163
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,500
 I used to eat those by the pound.

1164
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,500
 I know you can't tell, but I did.

1165
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,500
 I fucking love those things.

1166
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,500
 Yeah, my grandmother was a Werther's Original person.

1167
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,500
 I love me some butterscotch.

1168
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:19,500
 These were basically like Werther's Original, but you didn't have to work for it.

1169
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,500
 This was like, you just unwrapped.

1170
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,500
 They were the kind that you would use in baking if you needed to, right?

1171
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,500
 You just unwrapped a little square.

1172
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
 Oh my God.

1173
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,500
 I love those fucking things.

1174
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
 Excuse me.

1175
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,500
 You guys want to do a little Jock vs. Nerd?

1176
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,500
 More than anything in the world.

1177
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,500
 Let's do some Jock vs. Nerd.

1178
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:51,500
 Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

1179
01:06:51,500 --> 01:07:02,500
 Time for Jock vs. Nerd.

1180
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
 Explosion of butterscotch candy.

1181
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,500
 Biddle honey.

1182
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,500
 No, not Biddle honey.

1183
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:14,500
 We're going to Scoopity coming down to us today from Hoopy Fruits Scoop.

1184
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,500
 Hoopy Fruits Scoop.

1185
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,500
 You don't know what I got.

1186
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,500
 That's vaguely familiar.

1187
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,500
 What's that referencing?

1188
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,500
 Little Dooscoop.

1189
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,500
 Anybody know?

1190
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,500
 No, Hoopy Fruits.

1191
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
 I don't know.

1192
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,500
 Hoopy Fruits.

1193
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,500
 Hitchhikers, I guess.

1194
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
 Scoop Jesus is saying.

1195
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,500
 Hoopy Fruits.

1196
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,500
 Oh, okay.

1197
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:40,500
 After 12 years and 1800 performances, Rating the Rock Vault will close in Las Vegas at

1198
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,500
 the end of this year.

1199
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,500
 Less than 10 shows remain at the Hard Rock Cafe at the Las Vegas Strip.

1200
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,500
 Ticks available at ratingtherockvault.com.

1201
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,500
 To herald the end of the show, here's a Scoopity.

1202
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,500
 So it is a Scoopity, I guess, about the show Rating the Rock Vault.

1203
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,500
 Let's see.

1204
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,500
 The categories are Rating the Rock Vault.

1205
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,500
 All right.

1206
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,500
 Paul, you're up first.

1207
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,500
 What you want?

1208
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,500
 I'll go with Rating for 1200, please.

1209
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,500
 All right.

1210
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:13,500
 Rating the Country Vault ran for six years in what city?

1211
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
 Vegas.

1212
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,500
 Rating the Country Vault.

1213
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
 Yeah, I think it happened in Vegas.

1214
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,500
 Okay.

1215
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,500
 Branson, Missouri.

1216
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,500
 Okay, well, it didn't happen in Vegas.

1217
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,500
 Las Vegas of Missouri.

1218
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,500
 It ran in Vegas, though.

1219
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,500
 I think it showcased here, yeah, a little bit.

1220
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,500
 Let's see.

1221
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
 I'll try Vault for 400.

1222
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:41,500
 If you jump to the end of the show, what Van Halen song closes the show?

1223
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
 That would be Panama.

1224
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,500
 If you jump to the end of the show, the Van Halen song at the end of it is Panama.

1225
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,500
 I don't jump.

1226
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
 There you go.

1227
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,500
 It's possible that I have a bit of an unfair advantage on this Scoopity.

1228
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,500
 I might have seen Rating the Rock Vault more than you two gentlemen have seen it.

1229
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
 Well, yes.

1230
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
 I've seen it like three times.

1231
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,500
 No, you've seen it a handful of times.

1232
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,500
 Maybe four.

1233
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,500
 Yeah.

1234
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,500
 I will do "the" for 400, please.

1235
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,500
 Name any two Las Vegas properties that have hosted Rating the Rock Vault.

1236
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
 The Rio and the Hard Rock.

1237
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,500
 I love it.

1238
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
 Yeah, Rio and the Hard Rock.

1239
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:26,500
 LVH Westgate, Tropicana, Hard Rock Hotel, Rio and the Hard Rock Cafe.

1240
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
 Wow.

1241
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,500
 Absolutely.

1242
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,500
 Paul.

1243
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,500
 That show got around.

1244
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,500
 It did.

1245
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,500
 Rating for 2,000.

1246
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
 I've got to get back on the board.

1247
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:43,500
 What is the maximum capacity of Allegiant Stadium for a concert plus or minus 10,000?

1248
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,500
 35,000, isn't it?

1249
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
 I think you're low.

1250
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,500
 Oh, God.

1251
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,500
 All right.

1252
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,500
 Well, I'm going 35,000.

1253
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,500
 All right.

1254
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,500
 72,000.

1255
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,500
 Shit.

1256
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,500
 My butt.

1257
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,500
 Okay.

1258
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,500
 I would have been low, too.

1259
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,500
 I would have been 60,000.

1260
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,500
 72,000 people?

1261
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,500
 Yeah.

1262
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
 It's very big.

1263
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,500
 I guess.

1264
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
 I'll be the first to tell you.

1265
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,500
 It's very big.

1266
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,500
 Jinkies.

1267
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,500
 That's me.

1268
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,500
 That's me.

1269
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,500
 I'll try Rating for 400.

1270
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,500
 Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in what year?

1271
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
 Plus or minus two years.

1272
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
 Let's see.

1273
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,500
 That would be 1980s.

1274
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:27,500
 That's '80s, right?

1275
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,500
 1980.

1276
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,500
 I think it is '84.

1277
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,500
 No.

1278
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,500
 You think it's '80?

1279
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,500
 Yeah.

1280
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,500
 All right.

1281
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,500
 I'll back it up.

1282
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,500
 I'll go '82.

1283
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,500
 I'll get the plus or minus four.

1284
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
 Two years.

1285
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,500
 '81.

1286
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,500
 Right in the middle.

1287
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,500
 There you go.

1288
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,500
 Matt.

1289
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
 The for 800.

1290
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
 I crushed the first one.

1291
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,500
 What year did Rating the Rock Vault start in Las Vegas?

1292
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,500
 Pass.

1293
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,500
 It passes to Paul.

1294
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:59,500
 Also, we couldn't get a window on this one.

1295
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,500
 2011.

1296
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,500
 2011.

1297
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
 2013.

1298
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
 Poop, poop, poop.

1299
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,500
 Oh, you were close.

1300
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,500
 You were close.

1301
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,500
 I was close, but not close enough.

1302
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
 Wrong, but close.

1303
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,500
 Paul.

1304
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,500
 Rating.

1305
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,500
 Why don't I keep killing myself on Rating?

1306
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,500
 Which year did the Raiders start playing in Las Vegas?

1307
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,500
 Plus or minus one year.

1308
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,500
 2020.

1309
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,500
 2020 is absolutely correct.

1310
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,500
 We know that one.

1311
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
 Yeah.

1312
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,500
 That was the year everything went to shit.

1313
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,500
 Well, how so?

1314
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,500
 The Raiders.

1315
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,500
 The Raiders moved to Las Vegas.

1316
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,500
 The Raiders moved to Las Vegas.

1317
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,500
 It's all took.

1318
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,500
 Let's see.

1319
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,500
 I'll try Vault for 800.

1320
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,500
 Who originally wrote and recorded My Generation?

1321
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
 Linda Ronstadt.

1322
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,500
 Linda Ronstadt.

1323
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
 Linda LOD.

1324
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
 Linda LOD.

1325
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,500
 You want the name or just the band?

1326
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
 Like the name of the person or the band?

1327
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,500
 Because I don't know who wrote it.

1328
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
 Gloria Estefan.

1329
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,500
 Oh, I'm sorry.

1330
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,500
 It's Gloria Estefan.

1331
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,500
 I guess I'll just say The Who.

1332
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
 Oh yeah, it's The Who.

1333
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,500
 The Who?

1334
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,500
 Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam.

1335
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
 Just Cult Jam.

1336
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,500
 Matt, you're up.

1337
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,500
 Let's do The for 1200.

1338
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,500
 And which city did Raiding the Rock Vault first perform?

1339
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
 City of the Mind.

1340
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
 The City of the Mind.

1341
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,500
 Pass.

1342
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,500
 Paul.

1343
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:38,500
 Does that mean it has to start with T-H-E?

1344
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,500
 I don't think so.

1345
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,500
 Somewhere in England.

1346
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
 Okay.

1347
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,500
 I'll say Liverpool.

1348
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,500
 Show me somewhere in England.

1349
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,500
 Liverpool.

1350
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
 I think it's actually somewhere in Mexico.

1351
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
 Okay.

1352
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
 Los Angeles.

1353
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,500
 We're both wrong.

1354
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
 The Mexico of America.

1355
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,500
 Oh, Los Angeles.

1356
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,500
 The Angels.

1357
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,500
 So it was The.

1358
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,500
 Oh.

1359
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,500
 Yep.

1360
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,500
 Paul got it right.

1361
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,500
 I mean, I got it.

1362
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,500
 Paul, you're up.

1363
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
 Great.

1364
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,500
 I got one right.

1365
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,500
 I'll go with The again.

1366
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,500
 For 2000.

1367
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,500
 Daily Double.

1368
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,500
 Yeah.

1369
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
 Oh, here we go.

1370
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,500
 I'm coming out of the hole, mama.

1371
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,500
 Lead singers Todd Currens, who's been on this show, and Travis Cormier are natives of which

1372
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,500
 country?

1373
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,500
 That would be Canada.

1374
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,500
 Oh, Canada.

1375
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,500
 That's true.

1376
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,500
 And Paul is back to zero.

1377
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
 He's still in third place, but he is back to zero.

1378
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,500
 That's all I asked for.

1379
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,500
 I'll try Vault for 1200.

1380
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:45,500
 What song is originally by a Beatle and covered by G&R, by Guns N' Roses?

1381
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,500
 Oh, oh, fuck.

1382
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
 It's "Live and Let Die."

1383
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,500
 Damn it.

1384
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,500
 Paul McCartney, "Live and Let Die."

1385
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,500
 I knew that one.

1386
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,500
 I just saw him at concert.

1387
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,500
 I should have known that.

1388
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,500
 You just saw that.

1389
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,500
 Yeah.

1390
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,500
 I do love that cover of it, too.

1391
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,500
 Matt.

1392
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,500
 I will, I got to catch up here.

1393
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,500
 Oh, yeah.

1394
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,500
 Score check.

1395
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
 I'm winning 2800.

1396
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
 Matt is in second with 400.

1397
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,500
 Paul is in third with zero.

1398
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:17,500
 I will do rock for 2000.

1399
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,500
 All right.

1400
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,500
 Daily Double!

1401
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,500
 Do-do-do-do-do-do.

1402
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:27,500
 Drummer Blas Ellis of Rock Vault Tours with this holiday-themed rock show.

1403
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
 Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1404
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,500
 Come on.

1405
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,500
 You can get this one.

1406
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,500
 I know, I know.

1407
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
 I just had instant cognitive dissonance on it.

1408
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
 Yep.

1409
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:42,500
 Nicholas Newman, his wife drags him to it every year when they play in Jersey.

1410
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:48,500
 You know, this started in the really cold areas of Russia when they first started doing

1411
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,500
 the show.

1412
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,500
 Manheim Steamroller.

1413
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,500
 Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

1414
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,500
 Manheim Steamroller.

1415
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,500
 The Manheim Steamroller.

1416
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,500
 The Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

1417
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,500
 Blas drives a steamroller in Siberia.

1418
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,500
 Paul.

1419
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,500
 Vault for 2000, please.

1420
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:09,500
 Name the other Deep Purple song in the show besides "Smoke on the Water."

1421
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,500
 You know that other Deep Purple song.

1422
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,500
 Oh, it's "In a God of the Vita."

1423
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,500
 "In a God of the Vita," the famous Deep Purple song.

1424
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
 I don't know.

1425
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,500
 I don't know.

1426
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,500
 Is it not?

1427
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,500
 I don't know.

1428
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,500
 You want me?

1429
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,500
 Is that your guess?

1430
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,500
 Yeah, that's my guess.

1431
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,500
 Okay.

1432
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
 No, it's "Space Truck."

1433
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:34,500
 What the fuck?

1434
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,500
 "In a God of the Vita."

1435
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,500
 I'm in space and I'm truckin', baby.

1436
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,500
 Don't you know that I ha ha ha ha ha.

1437
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,500
 You remember when we used to make out to this hymn?

1438
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,500
 Oh, won't you truck with me?

1439
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,500
 That's me.

1440
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,500
 I'll try rock for 1200.

1441
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,500
 Name a song that S.J. sings in "Rock and Roll."

1442
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,500
 Oh, come on.

1443
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,500
 Your mama don't dance.

1444
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,500
 Oh, what does she sing?

1445
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,500
 She sings, I don't know.

1446
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
 She sings, "Here I Go Again."

1447
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,500
 Is Barracuda in there?

1448
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
 My white snake.

1449
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,500
 Barracuda.

1450
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,500
 She sings some white snake.

1451
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,500
 Yeah.

1452
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,500
 Let's see.

1453
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,500
 Oh, she sings some Rolling Stones.

1454
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,500
 What's that song called?

1455
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,500
 "Gimme Shelter."

1456
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,500
 Start me up.

1457
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,500
 Sing "Start Me Up."

1458
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,500
 She does "Start Me Up."

1459
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,500
 She sings "Brown Sugar."

1460
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,500
 She does "Gimme Shelter."

1461
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,500
 "Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac, "Gimme Shelter" by the Rolling Stones, "Heartbreaker" by Pat Benatar, and "Alone" by Heart.

1462
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,500
 Nice.

1463
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,500
 What a comprehensive list.

1464
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,500
 Yes.

1465
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,500
 Yeah.

1466
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,500
 It did take me longer to figure out what are the songs that she sings in that show that it should have.

1467
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,500
 That did seal the game for you, Jacob.

1468
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,500
 Oh, how nice for me.

1469
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
 Yeah.

1470
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
 Matt, you got rock for 400 or 800.

1471
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,500
 Well, it's tough.

1472
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,500
 Fighting for second place.

1473
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,500
 Yeah, if I get it right, then I'm in second.

1474
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,500
 If I get it wrong, I'm in second.

1475
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,500
 It's tough.

1476
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,500
 That's right.

1477
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,500
 I'll go for 800.

1478
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,500
 You could get the third daily double.

1479
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,500
 It's the third daily double.

1480
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,500
 It's not.

1481
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:09,500
 Todd Kearns of Rock Vault regularly performs with this top hat wearing member of Guns N' Roses.

1482
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,500
 Buckethead.

1483
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,500
 Yeah.

1484
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:18,500
 A young person brought up Buckethead to me a few weeks ago.

1485
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
 Yeah.

1486
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:23,500
 I was like, how do you know who Buckethead is?

1487
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,500
 Like somebody in their 20s brought up Buckethead to me.

1488
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
 I was like, how do you know who Buckethead is?

1489
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,500
 They're like, oh, he plays all this great guitar stuff and everything.

1490
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,500
 He's really good.

1491
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
 He's a great performer and everything.

1492
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,500
 Yeah.

1493
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,500
 And I said, did you know that he was in Guns N' Roses for a while?

1494
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,500
 And the look on this guy's face got hilariously huge.

1495
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,500
 He was the guitar player in Guns N' Roses.

1496
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
 Yeah.

1497
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,500
 Not back, but forward slash.

1498
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
 Forward slash of course is correct.

1499
01:17:51,500 --> 01:18:02,500
 And Paul closing out the category end the game rock for 400 former ICS guest and Rock Vault guitarist Rowan Robertson was a member of this metal band.

1500
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,500
 Oh God.

1501
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,500
 In excess.

1502
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,500
 Was he with Dio?

1503
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,500
 That's literally what the question is.

1504
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,500
 I think he was with Dio.

1505
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,500
 He was with Dio.

1506
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,500
 Yeah, I got it.

1507
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,500
 Oh, I'm so proud of myself.

1508
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,500
 Oh, Paul got the secret $8,000 question correct.

1509
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,500
 So that means, oh shit, that wasn't the $8,000 question.

1510
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,500
 No, I still win.

1511
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,500
 I win with 4,000 points.

1512
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:33,500
 Matt wins with $3,200 and Paul has negative 1600.

1513
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,500
 That's from a Hoopie Fruits scoop.

1514
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
 Thank you Hoopie Fruits.

1515
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,500
 Yeah, that was great.

1516
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,500
 If you want to make us a scooperty or any other kind of jock versus nerd or just send us in some email.

1517
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,500
 HayScoops.com is where you can go.

1518
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,500
 HayScoops.com.

1519
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,500
 Head over there.

1520
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,500
 Make us a scoop mail.

1521
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,500
 Make us a jock versus nerd.

1522
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,500
 Do a scooperty.

1523
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,500
 Do a Price is Scryte.

1524
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,500
 Do an obelisk.

1525
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,500
 You do all those things right over there at HayScoops.com.

1526
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,500
 We are running low on the jock versus nerds.

1527
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
 So go over there.

1528
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
 Make us one.

1529
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,500
 Yeah.

1530
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,500
 In fact, pick a different Vegas show that just closed and write a whole one about that one too.

1531
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,500
 That'd be great.

1532
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,500
 There's a lot more to choose from.

1533
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,500
 Keep them more every day.

1534
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,500
 We could just do a string of Las Vegas shows closing.

1535
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,500
 We can do Las Vegas shows close that we've been part of.

1536
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,500
 That's right.

1537
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
 Good Lord.

1538
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,500
 That'd be like two weeks of material.

1539
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,500
 Or some would say maybe 1260 episodes.

1540
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:31,500
 But it is the true story of this show.

1541
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,500
 Vegas shows closing.

1542
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,500
 I want to thank all the people's supporters over on our Patreon page.

1543
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,500
 Absolutely.

1544
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,500
 It's a new month with another list just yet.

1545
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,500
 But this is the part where we thank you by name.

1546
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
 It's one of the rewards that we offer.

1547
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,500
 So go to our patreon.com/hayscoops and check out the tiers that fit your budget today.

1548
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
 Both monthly or yearly options.

1549
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,500
 Yearly comes with a discount.

1550
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,500
 Was that web address too hard to pronounce?

1551
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
 That was a very long web address, Matt.

1552
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:02,500
 Just Google Pittsburgh extravaganza lantern zoo animal.

1553
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,500
 Pumpkin jack-o-lantern zoo.

1554
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,500
 No, go to preachingfun.com.

1555
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
 Sticks.

1556
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,500
 Sticks.

1557
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:16,500
 Come visit preachingfun.com.

1558
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:25,500
 It's better than hanging with your mom out of the bed.

1559
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:34,500
 Or if you've already applied to be the new pumpkin mold scraper at the Pittsburgh pumpkin zoo extravaganza doohickeything.org next year,

1560
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,500
 head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1561
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:40,500
 Farts, farts, farts, farts, farts.

1562
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:45,500
 Fartsinabag.biz.

1563
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,500
 That's fartsinabag.biz.

1564
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,500
 That along with preachingfun.com.

1565
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,500
 It does take you over to our Patreon site where for as little as $3 you can help keep this show on the air.

1566
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,500
 If you think this show is worth more than $3 a month, you can do that too.

1567
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,500
 It would really help us out.

1568
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,500
 Over there at preachingfun.com.

1569
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,500
 And of course, fartsinabag.biz.

1570
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,500
 Thanks, Penn, Jeff, for creating this podcast.

1571
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,500

1572
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,500
 And thanks, everybody, for joining us here on our Zoom.

1573
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
 And thanks, everybody, for joining us on Twitch.

1574
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,500
 Yep, that's right.

 Stay safe out there.

1576
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,500
 We love you.

1577
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,500
 And we'll see you soon.

1578
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,500
 We'll see you soon.

1579
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:48,500
 See you on the phone.

1580
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,500
 See ya.

1581
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,500
 Bye.

1582
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:57,500
 It's the bonus material for being a Patreon.

1583
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,500
 When everything just clicks.

1584
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,500
