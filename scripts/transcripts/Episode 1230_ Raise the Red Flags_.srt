00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,520
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,880
 Yeah, I'd love to!

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,520
 Great, let's go!

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,520
 Beautiful day in Las Vegas.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,800
 Well I hope it is.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 It's a night show.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
 If I type you here, there's going to be chaos out there though.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
 It's time for Matt Maddenley's ice cream social.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
 Sitting in Las Vegas, it's Matt Maddenley.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul Maddenley.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
 Sitting also in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob.

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
 We're Preaching Fun.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,920
 Hey guys.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
 How's it going, Jacob?

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 Good, good.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
 We're doing a little bank show action.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 I'm going to be out of town next week, so we're doing a little bank show here.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
 I saw Sarah Hester Ross's show the other night.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
 Oh good!

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,920
 And she makes a joke on her show that she is a Ferrari.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 They're both red and like three Italians inside them.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 Great.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
 And there's a guy who's a little into his cups.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,920
 First of all, shout out to Sarah Hester Ross for packing the composer's room.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
 Oh, fuck yeah.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 It's a hard room to pack and it was on a Monday night.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
 It's such a nice room.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
 It's such a nice spot.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 That whole building is such a nice spot.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
 It's just in a weird area.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
 Yes, it's in a weird area of town.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
 I keep being told that that area is about to get revitalized.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,920
 I've been being told that area is going to be revitalized any second now for 11 or 12 years.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
 Yeah, I've been hearing that forever as well.

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,920
 Now, inside the composer's room is a very affordable bar and affordable food and good bar food and good drinks.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 It's a spot that's really kind of angled towards Las Vegas entertainment professionals.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 Yeah.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,920
 They want entertainment folk to hang out.

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:43,920
 Sarah, she wanted me to follow and take some notes kind of thing, like little comedy notes, possible punch up kind of thing.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,920
 So I sat in the back and then on the table in front of me.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,920
 I don't know if they knew what they were signing up for or whether they were at the composer's showroom and they got like waved in or something.

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,920
 I don't know what happened, but it's just a hammered guy named Dominic.

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,920
 When you know the name, when the name comes out.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
 I can hear it now.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,920
 If it's the Dominic that I think it is.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,920
 Oh, I think he is either part of the ownership group for the composer's room or the owner.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
 OK, well, he was shouting after I think he's a big wig.

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,920
 After she's after he said three times to me, he just started going like I'm Italian.

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 Hey, hey, as if as if Sarah's or else would have stopped like, oh, you you are everyone.

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
 We should fuck. We should fuck now.

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
 Let's get me right now. Get inside me.

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
 Call to why are you in me? Hurry up.

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,920
 Call two friends and let's go.

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
 Call two friends.

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
 He'll call two friends. They'll call two friends.

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 They'll call two friends and they'll call two friends.

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,920
 And if he was part of the ownership group, then I mean, he seemed like a younger guy.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 But at one point, maybe it's not maybe it's a different Dominic Dominic involved in all that, though.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
 No, no, no. I mean, I think I know who you're talking about.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
 It was definitely some young Italian guy named Dominic.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
 Oh, good, good, good. OK.

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,920
 And he could not stop. It's funnier if it's the odor, though.

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,920
 He could not stop sharing his thoughts with his table.

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 It is what's going on. Of course.

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 Whatever. Yeah. One point.

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:38,920
 Sarah Saras. And I'm sure this is an old an old line, but she goes shut your mouth because this one's making money as she points back to her.

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
 Oh, I haven't heard that before. That might be new. I like that.

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 Shut your mouth because this one's making money.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,920
 That was a really good line. Really funny line.

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,920
 And then, like, you know, she sings like stop giving men microphones.

79
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,920
 She sings like really inspiring songs to women.

80
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 And it's hard to not take that one a little personally whenever she sings it at our events.

81
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 I like she has a point.

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,920
 Sarah Hester Ross comes to our events and sings stop giving men microphones.

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 It feels a little like an attack. She has a point.

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,920
 Not an unfounded attack, but an attack nonetheless.

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:24,920
 I know I even had her show in the fringe. I got to be in the chorus singing it in the background of my chorus robe.

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:33,920
 I loved it, but he was doing the like drunk magnanimous thing at the end.

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:43,920
 Like, no, no, I like her, you know, like she's good, you know, and then waiting for her to come out so he can like pay her the compliment of like even I liked your show.

88
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,920
 I thought you were great. Remember me, the one who ruins your show?

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:55,920
 You were fantastic. I normally hate people with vaginas, but you're all right.

90
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,920
 Scooper Nova Girl in the chat saying bring bring her back this year with Lucy Darling.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,920
 She has been teaming up with Lucy Darling, which is the craziest thing for me.

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,920
 Just just two people from very separate worlds in my life suddenly teaming up and working together out of nowhere.

93
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 It's been really cool, but they are their social media fame combined.

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,920
 They've been doing stuff and Sarah's actually going to go on some of the tours.

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,920
 I'll just let you know, Scooper Nova Girl. Lucy Darling is out of our range now.

96
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
 I think so.

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,920
 We tried to get her in ScoopFest a few years back and she had to cancel the last minute.

98
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
 She wasn't available.

99
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,920
 Not a problem, but now she's playing MGM for two weeks here in town.

100
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,920
 She just sold out two nights at a three thousand seat theater in Seattle.

101
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,920
 Yeah, she's busy.

102
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,920
 If she comes, it will be as a favor and as a friend.

103
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
 Yes. Yeah.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
 And therefore can't ask for like a full show kind of thing.

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
 Right.

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
 But I will. It's ScoopFest.

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
 I always I always reach out to people so you never know.

108
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,920
 But oh yeah, I'm I'm skeptical.

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
 We'll see. We'll see.

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
 But anyways, yeah.

111
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:22,920
 So Dominic was just really like just into his cups and really letting letting us know that his opinion mattered the most, which was good.

112
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,920
 So besides deciding to add more Dominic bits, was there anything else that you came up with?

113
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
 No, hiring Dominic full time.

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,920
 My big legal pad just said D-O-M and that's it. I just handed it to her.

115
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
 All Dom. All day long.

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
 More Dom.

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,920
 More Dominic as much as possible.

118
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:54,920
 I mean, this is not, you know, I'm not going to actually like, you know, share note stuff, but she has a new bit in her show where she's asking people for their red flags.

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:02,920
 A red flag bit. Yeah, we saw that. We've talked about that on the show on her at the what was the Fringe Fest called?

120
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
 Fallout Fringe.

121
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
 Fallout Fringe.

122
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 For her for her show at Fallout Fringe, we saw I think the inaugural.

123
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
 Yes, that was the first time trying out that bit.

124
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
 And after she's like, maybe I'll cut that bit.

125
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
 And I was like, well, don't you dare?

126
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
 No, no, no, no, no. That is a good bit.

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,920
 And yeah, we talked about on the other woman who her mom was at the bar getting getting a guy drinks or whatever.

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
 Yes.

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 And then so she I basically just, you know, it's not a big deal to say, like, move it earlier so that you can talk to them more like she has it later in her show.

130
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 And I'm like, no, no, this is you want more of this.

131
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,920
 And that way it creates more opportunity for the rest of the show for callbacks and stuff like that.

132
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
 Yeah.

133
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:53,920
 Girl raised her hand like this bit so good, I want to figure out a way to put it into my magic show and like make it some kind of prediction or something, because having people share red flag stories is great.

134
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
 It's a great idea.

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 And woman goes, I goes, secretly had a kid was what she said for like, what's your one sentence for it. And she goes, my guy was dating secretly had a kid.

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,920
 And then she goes, wait, what happened because I was dating this guy, and he had a woman who had a kid. And then I found out about the other one.

137
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:29,920
 And then so he had two other women with two kids that he wasn't talking about, or being with. And it was the third one that was the deal breaker.

138
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:39,920
 He found out that this person had three kids with three different women that he wasn't acknowledging until later on when they were dating was like, okay, it's time to get out.

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:51,920
 Sarah has Sarah's arrest goes, but you did have a kid with him right and she goes, yeah, yeah.

140
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
 One point for clarification.

141
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,920
 Just, just before I go, where's your one more thing.

142
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,920
 Holy shit. So this guy's just got it like that.

143
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,920
 Yeah, because magic did he have something going on be Christine the chances I think I know that guy.

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
 Sean congratulations.

145
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:27,920
 But, yeah, so I was like just there's there's no end to the red flag bits. It's a great thing to ask. And then of course, in Sarah's show.

146
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 She just Sarah quickly notes, by the way, it was only women who raised their hands, I did say anyone had a red flag story but only women stories.

147
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 It's possible. I don't know that I would raise my hand and Sarah showed to to tell a red, a red flag story either. Yes, that is a good point. That is a good point. Yeah, yeah.

148
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 There might be a little self censoring going on there as well. Look, I mean, there's a lot of women out.

149
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:09,920
 And this is what's cool is it like just Sarah has her audience right like it just it is a mostly women in the crowd and she does rip a lot of dudes and of course all all all all validly.

150
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:24,920
 I would say at least most of it has it coming. Yeah, exactly. So I think it's a fine she's she's lending a fine specific voice through tick tock and now her live show so it's all good when she sings stop giving men microphones and then just plays

151
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:37,920
 actual clips of men talking into microphones saying horrible things it's it's hard to argue. Yes, yeah. And that clip is great. The clips that she's another montage where she talks about not wanting have one.

152
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 She doesn't want to have kids.

153
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:59,920
 That one, she has also a montage of like, basically, children being disgusting in a montage that was a little tougher to watch, because it involves like kids pissing and shitting and stuff and you're just like, oh god.

154
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,920
 It is definitely a form of birth control the montage she has cut together.

155
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,920
 Other people's kids are the best birth control.

156
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:22,920
 Yeah, it's a it's it's a it's a tough one. And one of the lyrics is, it's like keeping come as a pet, and that one's a little strong.

157
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:31,920
 I like that because you because you have your pet come. And you were offended because I had to think about my own children to think about that line and be like oh god.

158
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,920
 It is like that.

159
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
 Kids.

160
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
 I can't even say it.

161
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 Hypothetically, listen here come one and come to

162
00:12:45,920 --> 00:13:05,920
 Keeler Hillier, you could just as easily have been remnants on a napkin.

163
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:14,920
 And now, like Pinocchio, you're no longer a napkin fodder. You're real boys.

164
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,920
 And you're turning into donkeys for reasons.

165
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:26,920
 And as you went to Paradise Island, as they cry, everybody comes on napkins, as they cry and hug, hug me for that storytelling.

166
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,920
 chaotic clumsy with don't open daddy sock drawer all your brothers and sisters are in there.

167
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 No, no, no. It's Donnelly's. It's only brothers. He's hung out for a few episodes now. Her favorite specific about men is that they jizz in socks. That is her favorite specific.

168
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,920
 chaotic has got a lane.

169
00:13:51,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 Don't be surprised that that's it's a fine topic for a Sarah Hester Ross song. So, what can I say I know men.

170
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 Socks standing up on their own is a fine Sarah Hester Ross song. It's a stiff lane. Yes, it's not a stiff competition.

171
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:23,920
 Wait, some of these jokes are getting crusty chaotic if you don't mind unmute yourself. I want to I want to ask you a question about this.

172
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:32,920
 If you're that you're worried about it. Imagine what all the things you could ask me in the world. And this is what you've said. I'm excited. That's it. That's it.

173
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,920
 Do you remember the first time you found out this fact?

174
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:53,920
 Oh, do you know what I do have this really horrible. It's a funny joke specific now but I imagine the first time you're you must have been like, what?

175
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:07,920
 I don't know how I don't know when I found out this specific fact but I do have a really horrible memory of going home with a man after a date. It's gone really well. It wasn't great, but you know.

176
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
 I apologized. I apologize. Come on.

177
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:30,920
 I don't know if you want to own up to this. I do remember getting out of the bed, walking across the floor where all of you know messy floor, and I do remember walking across the room and putting my foot down standing on us like a sock or something and it was like calm.

178
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 I probably went back for a second date.

179
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,920
 Girls get lonely.

180
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
 So do pieces of shirts and.

181
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,920
 So, unfortunately, I don't think they got that lonely that was the problem.

182
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 Maybe I just look particularly like a sock.

183
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
 Sock appeal.

184
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,920
 When we brought up any red flag stories did any red flag stories pop in your brain.

185
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,920
 Him.

186
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,920
 Only bad. I've got so many bad date stories it's unbelievable.

187
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,920
 Just, just one of them just one of your favorite bad date stories.

188
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:23,920
 Okay, I'll tell the very short version of this because it's so fresh in my head, because I bumped into them in the gym, which I feel like is a very woman thing to say that a stranger talked to me in the gym.

189
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
 Right.

190
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,920
 And he didn't, he recognized me and I didn't recognize him.

191
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,920
 Have you ever approached me to have a random conversation with me in the gym under any circumstance.

192
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,920
 Grow boobs, I really recommend it because it really.

193
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,920
 No, I have those two it does not work.

194
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
 Not perky enough.

195
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
 I understand.

196
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
 A little bit of height, you'll be fine.

197
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
 I do lack perk.

198
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
 Get some tape, get some tape.

199
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
 I've often said that about Donnelly.

200
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,920
 A little wonder bra.

201
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,920
 And now I do remember being on a date, and I tried really hard.

202
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,920
 And I've got, you know, new clothes and I've done my hair and I've done my makeup and I thought, oh, you know what, I'm killing it today.

203
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
 I recognize now I look like I own an OnlyFans.

204
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 I don't, but I recognize that's how it comes across.

205
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
 I didn't back then, and I had significantly less confidence.

206
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
 Okay.

207
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,920
 And I went out and he wasn't very chatty, but I'm from North of England, so that doesn't really matter.

208
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:28,920
 And so I had owned most of the conversation, I thought it was going really well, and then at the end of the day, he walked me back and we were walking down the street.

209
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,920
 And I thought, I've done really well and so proud of myself.

210
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
 Nailed it.

211
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:45,920
 And without looking at me, he walked down the road and sort of said, out of nowhere, usually I don't really date women who wear a lot of makeup.

212
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:54,920
 A particularly red lipstick because I, and I recognize that we're, for you guys, this may be a career decision.

213
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,920
 But he said, red lipstick, I always think makes them look like a clown.

214
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,920
 And unfortunately, I was wearing red lipstick at the time and I've never worn it since I was mortifying.

215
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
 What?

216
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,920
 He was basically trying to confess that he was turned off by your makeup, just your makeup.

217
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,920
 I really can't believe that he ghosted me afterwards.

218
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
 I did bump into him at the gym.

219
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
 He did say, I am usually a very lovely person.

220
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,920
 And you said, you said, you said, smell my flower, then you squirted all over his face.

221
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,920
 No, I really wish I'd been that nice.

222
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 So a really long story short, I didn't recognize him until he said his name and then somewhat like I had PTSD from being called a clown.

223
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
 Yeah, well, that'll, yeah, that'll happen.

224
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
 Which is not my career choice.

225
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,920
 I'm changing my name to John Wayne Gacy.

226
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,920
 He said, he said, he looked me up and down, which really grossed me out.

227
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,920
 And he said, it's a real shame it didn't work out.

228
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,920
 And then said something like, this guy is the worst talker.

229
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 Wait, wait, wait, one second.

230
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
 He looked, he physically looked you up and down.

231
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
 And then his comment was, it's a shame it didn't work out.

232
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
 It didn't work out?

233
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 Yeah, followed by.

234
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
 Holy fuck.

235
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
 It's a shame it didn't work out.

236
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,920
 And then said something like, I feel like, I feel like I really missed out.

237
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
 Something, something along those lines.

238
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
 That's terrible.

239
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:39,920
 To which I, with my blood, the same temperature as lava, looked him up and down and said something like, I think this was a worse scenario for you.

240
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
 And then I laughed.

241
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 Good.

242
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
 Looked him up and down and said, I'm fine with my existence.

243
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
 Oh, really?

244
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,920
 Age had not been kind, but also, you know, venom, I assume, as it flows through your body does somewhat ruin you.

245
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
 But he was about 18 at the time.

246
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,920
 And I am now 33, and this happened about a month ago.

247
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,920
 So I do feel like I should have had, you know, the wisdom on my side.

248
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,920
 But unfortunately, that was the kindest thing I could say.

249
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
 I think that was absolutely fair.

250
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 That clarification is interesting because one, the 18-year-old thing, everyone says something stupid things come out of your mouth at 18.

251
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
 So there you go.

252
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
 Stupid things come out of my mouth now, every day.

253
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 No, I'm talking about him.

254
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
 So many stupid things went into my mouth when I was 18.

255
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
 His, I guess I missed out.

256
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 That's how I ended up in the sock scenario, Jacob, I'm afraid.

257
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 His, I guess I missed out comment at the gym a month ago is idiotic.

258
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 He should have better ways of talking to you.

259
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,920
 Yes. Well, clearly he hasn't developed that muscle in those winning years.

260
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 So, yeah.

261
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,920
 And it doesn't sound like he's hyper attractive either, because there's a level that you can be at.

262
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,920
 There's a level of attractiveness you can be at and get away with saying stupid things like that.

263
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
 And it doesn't sound like he's even at that level.

264
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,920
 Well, unfortunately, the first thing that came into my head was don't get cocky, kid.

265
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,920
 He might laugh and then I'm really stuck in that scenario.

266
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
 I didn't want to make him laugh.

267
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 And you said you missed out and then you and 18 of your friends packed into that tiny car and drove off.

268
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
 No problem.

269
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,920
 What I should have told you is that I've become a party clown.

270
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,920
 But I do feel like if I'd stood in the gym and loudly announced that I was for hire, I don't think anyone would have thought I was a clown.

271
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,920
 Once again, looking for that page.

272
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,920
 Sometimes I consider it, you know, mortgages are expensive, you know.

273
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 Sure, me too.

274
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 It's 2025. We need that additional income.

275
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,920
 I have legitimately thought about photographing my feet.

276
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 I think you should, Paul.

277
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
 Paul, we're talking about ways to make money.

278
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,920
 No, I'm going to put clown makeup on him.

279
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,920
 So may I recommend bright red lipstick?

280
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
 OK, there you go.

281
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
 All right.

282
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,920
 Bright red lipstick on my feet dot com.

283
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,920
 Well, you're getting a lot of support from the chat here.

284
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
 That idiot. What a stupid asshole.

285
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 That sounds like he was trying to nagging.

286
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
 Yeah, there you go.

287
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,920
 So Gerardo mentions that it sounds like he got tips from one of those bro podcasts.

288
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,920
 He could have taken Paul's pickup class.

289
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 Yeah, he should have come to my improv class that I taught for the pickup artist kids.

290
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
 Although I wasn't teaching any pickup stuff.

291
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,920
 I was just teaching straight up improv.

292
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
 Well, that's why I do.

293
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,920
 I look like the poster girl for a pickup artist.

294
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 I get it. I get it.

295
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,920
 I've got piercings, tattoos, long red hair.

296
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
 I totally get it.

297
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,920
 Do you find yourself being approached by peacocking dudes often?

298
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
 All the time.

299
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,920
 Which isn't, believe me, is not a brag.

300
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 Sometimes they don't have teeth.

301
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
 No, it doesn't take a lot to peek.

302
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
 They just put on a funky hat.

303
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
 I apologized for speaking to you.

304
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
 I don't know why you keep bringing it back up.

305
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 I keep touching your hair in my defense.

306
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
 It's, you know, I can't help it.

307
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
 It's all attention to that.

308
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
 No, I do.

309
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
 But unfortunately, I'm also quite the nerd.

310
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,920
 So usually when they figure that out, that's also...

311
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,920
 What I love is that nerds don't talk to me

312
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,920
 because we're too socially awkward.

313
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
 So the only people that talk to me

314
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
 are the people you really don't want to talk to.

315
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
 It's always true. It's always true.

316
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,920
 That's why I got a podcast.

318
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
 Here we go.

319
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,920
 Thank you, Matt, for bringing up this traumatic event in my life.

320
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
 I'm so grateful to relive both the sock and the gym bro.

321
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
 All right. Well, my pleasure.

322
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
 You're welcome.

323
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 You're welcome so much.

324
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,920
 Once again, thank you because you sharing that with our community

325
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
 has helped some people grow, I'm sure.

326
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
 Nobody's going to wear red lipstick anymore.

327
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 I'm sorry, guys, wear it. It's exciting.

328
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 No red lipstick, no socks.

329
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 You know who else is going to help me grow?

330
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
 He could be wrong.

331
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 And that's the following sponsor.

332
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
 Today's show, Matt and Manley's Ice Cream Social

333
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
 is brought to you by...

334
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,920
 Where did that page go, guys?

335
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
 It's the ad page.

336
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
 I don't know.

337
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
 I have it.

338
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,920
 Hey, guys, today's show is brought to you by Steve.

339
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 Piff the Magic Dragon's older brother from Magic Shell Scoop in 2024.

340
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 Steve.

341
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
 Hey there, I'm Steve.

342
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,920
 Yes, I'm actually Piff's older brother.

343
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 Yeah, I'm the real one though.

344
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
 Yeah.

345
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 Look, I'm not a clone.

346
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
 Or am I?

347
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
 Maybe I am.

348
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 Maybe I'm not.

349
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
 You won't know.

350
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
 What's in that banana?

351
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
 What's in that banana?

352
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
 Oh, look, it's a dollar bill in the banana.

353
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:53,920
 [imitates gunfire]

354
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
 Where do you think he got all of it?

355
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 Where do you think he got all of it?

356
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
 Every bit.

357
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
 From me.

358
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
 Steve.

359
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
 Originator.

360
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
 Original creator.

361
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
 Oh, gee.

362
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 Original dragon.

363
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 Yes, that's right.

364
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
 Steve.

365
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
 I'm the one that came up with it.

366
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
 Who bought him the first dog?

367
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
 Me.

368
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
 Me.

369
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 It was me.

370
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 Yes.

371
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:24,920
 [imitates gunfire]

372
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
 Yes.

373
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 Explosion.

374
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 Enter HeyScoopz at checkout.

375
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,920
 Jacob, find KingScoop up there and bring KingScoop on here.

376
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
 Oh, where's KingScoop?

377
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,920
 KingScoop, unmute yourself.

378
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
 Reveal yourself, KingScoop.

379
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 Hello.

380
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
 Hello, can you hear me?

381
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
 Yes.

382
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
 Yes.

383
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
 What is your red flag story?

384
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,920
 So, went on a first date with somebody.

385
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
 It was going all right.

386
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,920
 We sort of went for drinks about an hour in.

387
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,920
 And then suddenly it got very serious as she just started discussing meeting her parents

388
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,920
 soon, when we would get married, and how many kids we would have together.

389
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 Was inclusive of you, not discussing it as a goal, but talking about it to you.

390
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
 Oh, yeah.

391
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
 Yeah.

392
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,920
 Basically, I want you to meet my parents soon.

393
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
 I want to get married soon.

394
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
 I want to get married.

395
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
 This is going to go well.

396
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
 We're going to get married.

397
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,920
 We're going to be like three kids, an hour into a first date.

398
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,920
 That's a pretty big red flag.

399
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,920
 And so how many kids do you have together with her now?

400
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 Three.

401
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,920
 I think it's funny.

402
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,920
 They're all secret kids.

403
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,920
 Hide them.

404
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,920
 I think that's the reputation when you first start dating as young adults, that women are

405
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
 looking for the hardcore relationships and blah, blah, blah, and men are worried about

406
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
 being tied down.

407
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
 And that's the stereotype of it.

408
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:12,920
 But when you say that story, I don't think about people I've dated as a whole.

409
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,920
 But one person comes to mind who was just a friend of my wife's.

410
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,920
 You don't think about people you date as wholes?

411
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
 No, I think of them as socks.

412
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
 I only think of them as wholes.

413
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 Oh, OK.

414
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
 Yeah, OK.

415
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 I was like, what?

416
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
 OK, yeah.

417
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
 What's the point?

418
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,920
 Just like one person who's just, no matter what, after it, just had a goal of wanting

419
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,920
 to wrap it up, settle down, have kids do it.

420
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,920
 And every person she dated would just see it from a mile away.

421
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,920
 And she'd come over and cry to my wife and just be like, it didn't happen again, and

422
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
 blah, blah, blah.

423
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
 It didn't happen again.

424
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,920
 I mean, she didn't say those words.

425
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
 She said that.

426
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
 But you know what's funny, Matt?

427
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 You say that.

428
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,920
 And Kingscoop, thank you for the story.

429
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,920
 You know what that is?

430
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,920
 To put it in a improv context, because I'm getting my brain more and more back into the

431
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
 old improv zone.

432
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 That's that scriptwriting stuff that we try and knock out of folks early on, right?

433
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,920
 You enter a scene and you've decided where it's going to go and how it's going to play

434
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 out.

435
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,920
 And that gives you no room to actually play off of and discover stuff with your partner.

436
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
 Yeah.

437
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
 Right.

438
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,920
 So if you come in to a relationship and you've already decided how it's going to go, it's

439
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
 over.

440
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,920
 That's not you're not going to have any kind of reciprocal interest because you've decided

441
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
 you've already got this thing in your head.

442
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 So you've got to have a much more open view to even possibly get things cooking.

443
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,920
 Wait, Stephen Eames, unmute yourself if you can.

444
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,920
 Oh, here we go.

445
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,920
 Hey y'all.

446
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,920
 So it says in your chat you had an ex that was dead set on getting married and having

447
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,920
 kids before her grandma died?

448
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
 Yeah.

449
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
 Yeah.

450
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
 Yeah.

451
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:24,920
 So she, what she wanted, she wanted to give her grandmother, like grandkids, great grandkids,

452
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,920
 I guess, or grandkids or at least acceptable grandkids, right?

453
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
 Yeah.

454
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
 Moderate grandkids.

455
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
 Moderately acceptable grandkids.

456
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
 Yeah.

457
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,920
 Thing is she already has a sister that had two kids of her own.

458
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,920
 There were already great, great kids out there.

459
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,920
 Yeah, I already had them.

460
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,920
 She thought she could give greater grandkids.

461
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
 I guess so.

462
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,920
 I thought that she could improve on the situation.

463
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,920
 Was she competitive with her sister?

464
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
 Clearly.

465
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,920
 Only when it came to quality of children.

466
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
 Yeah.

467
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,920
 Now, I wouldn't say she was competitive of her, but although the sister did literally

468
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,920
 go next door to her mom and dad's house.

469
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,920
 So I don't know if there was some kind of weird competition thing going or what the

470
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,920
 deal was, but yeah, no, this is also the same one that we had been dating for about a month,

471
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
 I guess.

472
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,920
 And we came back from a trip and picked up some fried chicken on the way back to her

473
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
 parents' house.

474
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,920
 And we're just sitting around the table.

475
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
 Her mom comes in, starts talking with him.

476
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,920
 And stuff, and mind you, this is like, I think this was the first time I'd ever met her mom.

477
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,920
 And she along the lines of just says, well, I mean, y'all might as well be married now.

478
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:58,920
 I mean, you're sitting around my table eating fried chicken.

479
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,920
 That is almost exactly the conversation that I had with my future mother-in-law the first

480
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,920
 time I met her.

481
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,920
 Listen, things just operate differently here in the South.

482
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
 It really does.

483
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
 That's a fucking fact.

484
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
 It really does.

485
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
 That's a fucking fact.

486
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,920
 And honestly, you eat somebody's homemade fried chicken, you have made a sacred bond.

487
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
 That's true.

488
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
 Oh, no, no.

489
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
 This wasn't homemade.

490
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
 This is church's chicken.

491
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
 I'll grant you.

492
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
 I'll grant you that.

493
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
 But again.

494
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
 Your honor.

495
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,920
 I think she was just looking into the future of when she was going to cook you a meal and

496
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
 it was all going to lock in like that.

497
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,920
 I'm not saying this conversation is violently American.

498
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
 Yes.

499
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
 Yes, it is.

500
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
 It absolutely is.

501
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
 Yeah.

502
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
 That is just true.

503
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
 That's true.

504
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
 That's true.

505
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,920
 But fried chicken in someone's home, that's an intimate thing.

506
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:58,920
 That's an intimate thing because, you know, at least the way I eat fried chicken, I could

507
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,920
 very easily lose friends and influence.

508
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,920
 My wife wanted to stay with me after seeing me eat fried chicken is also a big hurdle.

509
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
 Right?

510
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
 It's a litmus test.

511
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,680
 It's an American coupling litmus test.

512
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,400
 You don't think when you think the grass is greener on the side or you want to, you know,

513
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,480
 get out there and stretch it, you don't think about someone watching you eating something

514
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,040
 for the first time and taking that in.

515
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,400
 Can they eat fried chicken?

516
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,280
 We eat fried chicken with fork and knife.

517
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,920
 Bossy, get out of here.

518
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
 Portuguese.

519
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
 That's not true.

520
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,080
 Is it bone in still?

521
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,520
 If it's bone in, you got real problems, Bossy.

522
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
 Bossy.

523
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,040
 You're super talented with that fork and knife.

524
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
 Yeah.

525
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
 This is amazing to watch.

526
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,080
 Unless you really can just like, like, like all the bones that I completely cleaned at

527
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
 the end.

528
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
 Yes, chef.

529
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,200
 Watch me cut up this chicken.

530
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,240
 The bones actually spell out less.

531
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
 Yes, chef.

532
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
 On the plate.

533
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
 Everybody's done.

534
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,160
 Chaotic says I assert dominance by maintaining eye contact while eating fried chicken.

535
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,800
 Yeah, I would.

536
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 That would be my move.

537
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,280
 It's a power move.

538
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,440
 It's a power move.

539
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,480
 Like, people literally lose, like, the New York City mayor's election for being caught

540
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
 with a fork and knife on a piece of pizza.

541
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,040
 Like, if there's just a photo, it's like, it's like it's over.

542
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
 That has happened.

543
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,880
 That has happened numerous times.

544
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,760
 I can imagine down south eating fried chicken with a fork and knife might be a deal breaker

545
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,240
 for political office.

546
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,680
 It might be.

547
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
 Come on.

548
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,480
 Come on.

549
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
 Fried chicken with a fork and knife.

550
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
 Who was it?

551
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,960
 Who was the politician a couple of years ago that said Nevada?

552
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
 Oh, yeah.

553
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,800
 They were very, they're very keen on saying Nevada a lot and everybody was just like,

554
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
 fuck this person.

555
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
 Can't say Nevada.

556
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
 They have to say Nevada.

557
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,040
 I still remember moving here and being like, oh, come on.

558
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
 Don't make it such a big deal.

559
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
 Oh, yeah.

560
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,840
 A year later, I was like, Nevada.

561
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
 Like no.

562
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
 Just totally switched.

563
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,080
 I can't imagine being upset about that.

564
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
 It's Nevada.

565
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
 Wait.

566
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,720
 So, Steve, was the grandmother in good shape or did you feel like this was like a dire

567
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
 deadline?

568
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,360
 No, grandma was in pretty decent shape, bad manner actually.

569
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,160
 It was like, I came home from the hospital and was like, let's make kids.

570
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
 Let's moan.

571
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
 No, no.

572
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:19,800
 This, I met grandma like actually, we were returning from the trip to see grandma when

573
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,040
 we stopped and got the chicken.

574
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,640
 That was apparently my marriage proposal according to her mom.

575
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,160
 But yeah, no, she just, yeah.

576
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,160
 And yeah, I still ended up dating that girl for about a year.

577
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:41,840
 So yeah, apparently I'm really shitty at picking up red flags.

578
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
 We all are.

579
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
 We all are.

580
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 Yeah.

581
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
 Yeah.

582
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
 Yeah.

583
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
 Well, thank you, Steven.

584
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
 I appreciate you for coming and chiming in.

585
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
 Yes.

586
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
 Thanks for sharing.

587
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
 Yep.

588
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,640
 You know who else has some lovely stories about Steven's ex and that's the following

589
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
 sponsor.

590
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:05,160
 Today's show is brought to you by Auntie Anne's Ant Coated Pretzels.

591
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
 That's right.

592
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,040
 Auntie Anne's Ant Coated Pretzels from Nesticle Scoop in 2024.

593
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,480
 It's time.

594
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,120
 Time to get that protein.

595
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
 Yeah.

596
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,800
 You want that protein hit?

597
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:25,760
 You need that straight insect protein brought to you, fresh, hot, and salty by Auntie Anne's.

598
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,720
 All we do is open up the back door in the mall, let the critters come in and stick them

599
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,120
 inside the pretzels.

600
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,560
 Once they reach a certain temperature, they're basically clean.

601
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,960
 That's the first thing you need to know.

602
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,720
 Like a pasteurized ant?

603
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
 Pasteurized ants.

604
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
 Yes.

605
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,320
 I'm here from the health department.

606
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,680
 I'm here to just do some little quality control on the ants here.

607
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,240
 I understand that you have ants in this restaurant.

608
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
 Yes.

609
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
 I just wanted to come check them out.

610
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,320
 We cook them directly into the pretzel.

611
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
 Oh.

612
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,640
 Oh, you cook them?

613
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
 Of course.

614
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,000
 Also, after you cook them, they're basically clean.

615
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Right.

616
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,040
 Once they reach a certain temperature, they're basically clean.

617
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,840
 I was worried that they weren't getting cooked, so they wouldn't be basically clean.

618
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,680
 What kind of a mall pretzel stand do you take us for, Inspector?

619
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
 I apologize.

620
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,440
 Oh, but seriously, you've got to try some of these ant-filled pretzels.

621
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,440
 Not only are they crunchier, but they are filled to brim with protein.

622
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
 Did you know?

623
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
 Oh, well, let me try one.

624
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
 Go ahead.

625
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
 Have some.

626
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
 Let's see.

627
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
 I don't know.

628
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
 What?

629
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
 What?

630
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
 What is that?

631
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
 They're biting.

632
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
 They're eating me from the inside.

633
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
 Oh.

634
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
 Oh, no.

635
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
 Oh, whoops.

636
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
 Oh, no.

637
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
 The ants are eating me from the inside.

638
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
 So sorry.

639
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,720
 There's one of them that wasn't cooked, so those ants weren't clean.

640
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,280
 Also they were fire ants and cannibalistic.

641
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
 Sorry.

642
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
 Sorry.

643
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
 I'm dead.

644
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
 Oh.

645
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,560
 Enter Hague Scoops to check out.

646
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
 Auntie Anne's.

647
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
 Oh, Auntie Anne's.

648
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
 Oh, Auntie Anne's.

649
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
 Are there any?

650
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
 Are they even worried about airports now?

651
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
 I don't.

652
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
 I don't know.

653
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,560
 I mean, I'm sure there's a couple of mall spots.

654
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,400
 There's a couple of malls still around.

655
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,120
 We have a Grandma Anne's Nut Breads out here by our wall.

656
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
 Slower.

657
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
 I'm telling you.

658
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
 What?

659
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,240
 Grandma Anne's Nut Breads.

660
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,560
 And every time we drive by Anne's like, "We should go to Grandma Anne's Nut Breads."

661
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
 I think she's been once.

662
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
 I agree.

663
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
 We should.

664
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,440
 But it's one of those like definitely like a small entrepreneurial thing and only open

665
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,840
 at certain hours and got her regular customers and just doing her thing.

666
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
 So.

667
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
 Yeah.

668
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
 Yeah.

669
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,120
 I think he's on like a walk or a bike.

670
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,880
 I think he's on a bike.

671
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,560
 And like, it's funny because when we make our podcasts, I picture people like listening

672
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,920
 to us while they're walking or driving or whatever.

673
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,600
 But it's weird to see it in action.

674
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,360
 It's weird to see it actually happening.

675
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 Oh, yeah.

676
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,960
 There he is.

677
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,840
 Danny just on a bike ride doing his thing.

678
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
 It's fantastic.

679
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
 Yeah.

680
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
 Yeah.

681
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
 Just having a good time.

682
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
 Love it.

683
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,640
 Speaking of nut bread.

684
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,240
 I just hope we don't see like a bird fly like right into his face or something and he has

685
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,920
 to like fend off a bird attacked by an albatross.

686
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,720
 Galactic president says nut bread.

687
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,440
 I thought socks were bad.

688
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,920
 This bread is rather stiff.

689
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
 Yeah.

690
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,280
 I mean, it's very absorbent.

691
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
 That's the weird thing.

692
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,880
 Everyone's in there ordering nut bread and they're all skipping the joke and skipping

693
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,840
 the thing in their head, right?

694
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,080
 They're all like just like, yeah, just like I can't make a jizz joke, but I do want to

695
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
 try this bread.

696
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
 I don't even think.

697
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,480
 I would like some banana nut bread.

698
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,360
 I don't think that enters the mind of the person that goes to Auntie Anne's banana nut

699
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
 bread.

700
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,360
 It's not even banana, it's just nut breads.

701
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,120
 All kinds of nut breads.

702
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,360
 Oh, B. Christine also made the same joke at the same time.

703
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,280
 I want to give credit to B. Christine and galactic president for making the nut bread

704
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,320
 versus socks joke.

705
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,640
 We did it.

706
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,200
 Nut bread versus socks coming to a theater near you in 2026.

707
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
 Hey nut bread.

708
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
 Hey socks.

709
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,120
 What are you doing today?

710
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:31,880
 Well, I got to say socks, I went to a bar the other day and there was a horse tending

711
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
 bar.

712
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
 Oh yeah.

713
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,800
 What do you think I should have said to him?

714
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,600
 Hey buddy, why the long face?

715
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
 That's exactly right.

716
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
 There you go.

717
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,440
 That's what makes them the comedy team of legend right there.

718
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,600
 Nut bread and socks are actually good.

719
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,800
 They actually know their shit.

720
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,080
 If you can't make them laugh, get an attaboy.

721
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,360
 Get an attaboy out of them.

722
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:04,680
 You know, they finish each other's words, drinks, drinks, hot dog bun has entered the

723
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
 chat.

724
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,480
 Quick reminder, I'm going to be in Mesa, Arizona, July 31st, August 1st and August 2nd.

725
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,600
 If you can't find the ticket link, because I guess it is hard to find, it's in my Instagram

726
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600

 I'm there three nights, three nights only.

730
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
 It is a Mystique venue, but it's not a dinner venue.

731
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,960
 It's just a fancy theater.

732
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
 So it's just my show.

733
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
 Oh, nice.

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,360
 Oh, and hey, if you're broke, wait, Matt, what is your Insta?

739
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,840

748
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,820
 We had a scoop come out last time was amazing that they made a long journey halfway across

749
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,880
 the state to come and take a class with me.

750
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,120
 It was fantastic.

751
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
 Had nine students.

752
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
 They were really, really great.

753
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,520
 So please come on out.

754
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,280
 I'm still knocking the ring rust off my improv teaching again.

755
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,920
 And I'd love to see some more scoops in the house.

756
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,300
 So please come on by.

757
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,760
 I've only got a few more of these free classes that I'll be doing before I'm actually teaching

758
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,480
 professionally again with skit.

759
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
 Nice.

760
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
 What?

761
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,640
 What if I don't have anything to plug?

762
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
 What if you aren't broke?

763
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,820
 Paul, can you still take the class?

764
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
 You can.

765
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,400
 Not only can you take the class, but the fact that it's free, you can then kind of just

766
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,800
 do the math in your head and go, Oh, I should give Paul the pretend money that I was going

767
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,960
 to spend that I would have spent on this cloud.

768
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,440
 I'll just give smart, smart money.

769
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
 That'll work.

770
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
 And it really will work.

771
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
 It will absolutely work.

772
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,020
 And I will accept any tips.

773
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,560
 Even a dollar is fine.

774
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
 Yeah.

775
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,000
 Uh, Paul, and since you're not getting paid, you will be accepting just the tips, brother

776
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 right in the nut bread.

777
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,780
 Oh, this nut bread can stand up on its own.

778
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,000
 Steven Eames is asking you to define ring rust, please.

779
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,080
 Uh, so that's a wrestling term for guys who haven't wrestled in a while.

780
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,240
 They have a rust, but it could also be, that man's done could also could also be a twink

781
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,800
 out of the game a little long, you know, okay, this great bit of minutes since I had my spinner

782
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,240
 game down, I need to people's snacks and particles free.

783
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
 I don't know.

784
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,040
 I know what beef is.

785
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,360
 I have had beef experience.

786
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,600
 I know beef, beef, curtains, uh, ring rust is why you use a muffler.

787
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
 That is great.

788
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
 Be correct.

789
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
 Be Christine.

790
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
 Uh, yes.

791
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,300
 Uh, yes, I will accept just the tip into my rusty ring.

792
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,520
 As long as, as long as it's us legal tender, let's go, uh, whatever you got to, whatever

793
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,640
 you got to do.

794
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,960
 If it's us legal tender and a flared base, let's dance.

795
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,440
 I'm sticking up my ass.

796
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,480
 We got to get you a bidet.

797
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
 You ain't kidding.

798
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
 Country scoop.

799
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,200
 I am still, I am still Jones in for that Japanese toilet.

800
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,400
 One of these days when I make Japanese toilet money, I'm telling you, buddy, I do.

801
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
 You have one now.

802
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
 I have, why?

803
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,920
 No, I don't have the full on Japanese toilet.

804
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,520
 I don't have the expensive Japanese toilet.

805
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,640
 I just have the, uh, the bolt on the bolt on bidet thing that goes on the bolt on bidet

806
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
 thing.

807
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
 Okay.

808
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
 Let real time is great.

809
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
 We'll talk.

810
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,840
 What'd you spend for your bolt on bidet thing?

811
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
 If you don't mind me.

812
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,200
 Oh, probably like 150 bucks.

813
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
 Okay.

814
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,580
 So the one I got was like 25.

815
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:03,000
 So I should probably spend a little more definitely tried to spend a little more plus also cause

816
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,800
 it was, is yours heated?

817
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
 Yeah.

818
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
 Yeah.

819
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
 Mine.

820
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
 Mine has a, you have to have electric electricity for it.

821
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
 Right.

822
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
 Yeah.

823
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,080
 Mine was going to just squirt straight, icy tank water up your Hinder.

824
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,640
 So which I've done those two.

825
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
 Those aren't bad.

826
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
 No, no.

827
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,800
 I still think that's better than just regular toilet.

828
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,480
 That's better than just wiping your ass with dry ass toilet paper.

829
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,640
 Tank water up your Hinder.

830
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,400
 Was that Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra?

831
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
 I forget.

832
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
 Oh, that was Dino.

833
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 That was Dino.

834
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
 That was Dino.

835
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
 Yeah.

836
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
 Yeah.

837
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,600
 Um, go ahead and just relax that asshole.

838
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,360
 It's time for me to come on in.

839
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,920
 Tank water up your Hinder.

840
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:45,920
 Hey, that's what's been this martini glass of mine the whole time.

841
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,300
 Jacob, what about mail from listeners who haven't joined us?

842
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,520
 Do we have any scoop mail?

843
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,520
 Let's do a little scoop mail.

844
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,320
 I had to find it on my screen.

845
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,720
 Oh, let's see.

846
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,480
 Oh, we got one here from a Hatchet Scoop.

847
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,760
 Uh, oh, this is a long one.

848
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,400
 Uh, Hatchet Scoop says I was hesitant to write about this because I couldn't find something

849
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,720
 to add that I thought might be entertaining or funny.

850
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,320
 But you mentioned that you also want to hear sad stuff from people as well.

851
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,760
 But I have lots of sad to share.

852
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
 So here we go.

853
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
 All right.

854
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,960
 Near the end of 2024, I began to hate a job that I loved originally due to many changes

855
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,960
 in upper corporate.

856
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,260
 I worked in retail as a meat cutter, which was great, but the company was becoming more

857
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,920
 and more hostile towards us and was making it clear that they didn't really want us to

858
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
 exist.

859
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,720
 So they were making our lives more and more difficult between that and the almost our

860
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
 community.

861
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,360
 I decided to quit and take a warehouse job that was much harder work with less benefits

862
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,320
 and paid less.

863
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,120
 But it was seven minutes away from home and the work was actually pretty enjoyable, despite

864
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,400
 the difficulty.

865
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,000
 This job was short lived, sadly, after a couple of months, the work was mostly gone as the

866
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,400
 company we were working for decided to hire their own warehouse workers instead of using

867
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,600
 the third party company that I worked for.

868
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,540
 This was around Christmas and with no work being given to us, I decided to just quit.

869
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,400
 This was also motivated by several unexplained health issues that I was having.

870
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,160
 So I figured it would take some time to figure out why I was feeling so ill and look for

871
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,480
 a new job after the New Year's.

872
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,320
 Well, New Year's arrived, I have several doctor's appointments after several scans and a lot

873
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
 of prodding.

874
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,000
 They sent me to a GI doctor who ran a camera in both ends of me.

875
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,800
 As I awakened from being put under, I see my wife in the hospital room with me, which even

876
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,360
 in my groggy state makes me anxious because she wouldn't be here if everything was fine.

877
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,960
 Everything wasn't, in fact, fine.

878
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,840
 The examination found fairly advanced cancer.

879
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,800
 I am a little under 40 and all the tests that they did up to this point pointed towards

880
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,340
 it not being cancer.

881
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,200
 All the doctors repeatedly told me that they didn't see any signs of cancer, but here

882
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,560
 I am half dazed with my devastated wife being told that they were all wrong and that is

883
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,140
 what is making me so sick.

884
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,040
 After many more doctor visits and examinations, they discovered that it's in stage 3 and

885
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,840
 will need many months of radiation and chemo followed by surgery.

886
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,040
 I'm not angry with the doctors, but this was a gut punch to hear.

887
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,740
 Now unable to work because the only skills I have are in physical labor, which I am now

888
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:22,280
 too sick to do, excuse me, I find myself at home a lot with far too much time to think.

889
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,800
 I am worried about myself, of course, but also scared for my partners.

890
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,800
 My wife has a good job, but is now responsible for all of the bills.

891
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,600
 Because of this, I end up cancelling my Patreon, sorry guys, no, don't apologize to us.

892
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,240
 I was sympathetic up until this point, now I'm furious.

893
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,800
 We'll be ending this email immediately, thank you very much for your past support.

894
00:47:49,800 --> 00:48:00,000
 Jacob, please show that letter to the shredder please.

895
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,760
 Michael Kennedy, cancer is no excuse to not tithe to the boys.

896
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
 Agree.

897
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
 Agree.

898
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,240
 No, no, no, get a little less chemo, that won't kill you.

899
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,240
 Of course.

900
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
 Oh shit, it might.

901
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,800
 Of course we're just kidding, but if you can let your wife know about her Patreon.

902
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,800
 I'm joking, I'm joking.

903
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,880
 You said she still has a gig, right, yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

904
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,960
 All this is because we're joking comfortably for what is a horrible situation, so I'm very

905
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,760
 sorry that you are, I mean that's things like the health diagnosis is awful enough and the

906
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,960
 dominoes it pushes, I mean we think about this all the time and in our country, in America,

907
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,920
 they say like that most people are just one major medical emergency away from bankruptcy.

908
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:52,720
 If not for Ann having a good job with incredible insurance and even then, you know, coming

909
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:00,720
 through with a chunk of change to make my operation feasible, I would be dead possibly

910
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,600
 by now because the kind of pain I was in a couple, like a year and a half ago, was unsustainable

911
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:15,560
 and I will say for all the awful of that experience, I have gained so much more empathy, insight

912
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:23,320
 and understanding into the plight of folks who have any kind of physical disability.

913
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:30,280
 I'm grateful for it in a sense, it has made me a more grateful person for my day to day

914
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
 moving around.

915
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,600
 Oh yeah, well keep going with the letter.

916
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:40,040
 Okay, well I also have two girlfriends who are equally terrified for me as my wife.

917
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,640
 One of my girlfriends also has three kids who I have known since before they were born

918
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,040
 and their ages are from 4 to 13, so explain to them what is wrong with me, that's hard

919
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,240
 on them as well.

920
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,200
 My girlfriends have also had to watch people they love already die from cancer, one her

921
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,320
 father and the other a boyfriend, so now all of that old trauma is coming up as well.

922
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,960
 Oh and the girlfriend whose boyfriend died also found out at almost the same time that

923
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,720
 I was diagnosed with cancer, one of her oldest friends was as well.

924
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,720
 So now we are going through treatment at the same time, which is weird, sorry to be such

925
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,920
 downer but this year has just been a kick in the teeth, we'll try to write again with

926
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,000
 something more entertaining soon, as I have said I have several partners and my life is

927
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,560
 rather strange so maybe I'll write in about bondage or kink, oh that reminds me I was

928
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,720
 playing with fire on my girlfriend once and the torch got a little too close to my face

929
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,400
 and set my beard on fire, not terribly and I tried to act like nothing happened but it's

930
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,240
 really hard to ignore the smell of burning hair, oh just imagine you're in like sexy

931
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,220
 fun times with your partner and you accidentally set yourself on fire, you put it out real

932
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,720
 fast nobody's hurt but you're just trying to pretend like nothing happened so you can

933
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,880
 keep on going with sexy fun times.

934
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,320
 That's great, that's tough and you got to fight that smell too.

935
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,480
 Yeah, anyway thanks for listening, hope things are well for you and all the other scoops

936
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,240
 out there and as always fucking you in the face with my now irradiated dick, that is Hatchet

937
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
 Scoop.

938
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
 Hatchet Scoop.

939
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
 Thank you Hatchet Scoop.

940
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:22,000
 Speedy recovery, keep your attitude positive, as positive as you can and we're thinking

941
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 about you man.

942
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 So yeah.

943
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,440
 No, I mean you bring up like even like you said like I'll write in something interesting,

944
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,500
 I mean the truth is when we hear about people in polyamorous relationships or however you

945
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,880
 would qualify yours, we don't think about the serious stuff so actually what you are

946
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,520
 writing is something kind of fascinating which is like most people don't think about what

947
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,760
 that means like yeah you're in more people's lives and so when bad news happens it pushes

948
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,960
 all kinds of dominoes that you didn't anticipate, that someone in a more traditional relationships

949
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,720
 would anticipate rather and so that is tougher and it is different but also offers a different

950
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,080
 network of support which is also intriguing as well and really a bigger prover right like

951
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:09,040
 it's like I think people in heteronormative relationships could be skeptical of these types

952
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:17,760
 of things, it could be skeptical of the legitimacy of polyamorous relationships right and so you

953
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:25,320
 are showing that these are indeed as equally fulfilling relationships as anyone could ever

954
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,840
 have before by having this network of support.

955
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:34,160
 If not more so, if not more important and smart as far as having a redundant system

956
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
 of support.

957
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,560
 It is, that's it I'm going to tell my wife I need a redundant system of support right

958
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,560
 now.

959
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
 Hold on.

960
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:49,680
 I'm sure she'll buy it, no but really I mean there is something to be said for the fact

961
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,120
 that you guys are going to keep calling it right now.

962
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:02,800
 No but really like you know if something happens to one of us heaven forbid something happens

963
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,440
 to both partners at the same time.

964
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,520
 Oh sure, then there you go.

965
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:12,720
 I mean I don't even know what would happen like if I lost one of my partners and then

966
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:22,440
 I lost the other partner and then the third one just left oh no that's bad, that's a bad

967
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
 day.

968
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
 Yeah that's low.

969
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,400
 Is that your polymathery is that what that is?

970
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,840
 That's polymathery yeah.

971
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
 Alright.

972
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,800
 It's also going to be the name of my assistant in my magic career.

973
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
 Polymathery.

974
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
 Polymathery.

975
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:43,160
 She's going to do magic squares and all it's going to be great.

976
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,320
 Let's do a little hatchet scoop thank you so much for writing in.

977
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:53,080
 We always we honestly we love hearing even the serious sides from our scoops that are

978
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,200
 out there.

979
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,240
 We just love hearing from you all so much and we love when you include us in your lives

980
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,760
 like that and give us a little peek into your real life like that.

981
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,920
 It's touching and kind of moving as well so thank you so much for that hatchet scoop.

982
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,440
 Yeah thanks for writing us for real.

983
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,680
 Gerardo says can I get a couple of boyfriends and girlfriends from here not to do anything

984
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,680
 sweat house but just to take the world's stubbornest toddler to bed.

985
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,640
 I can cook.

986
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,340
 If you're offering to cut people's fried chicken for them I'm sure you're going to get a lot

987
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,340
 of boyfriends and girlfriends.

988
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,800
 Would you stop with that cutting fried chicken mess?

989
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
 Who are you even?

990
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
 Who are these monster people?

991
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:34,360
 Oh wait that was Bossy I was Bossy I'm mixing up my Latin named scoops in the chat.

992
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:43,200
 What a bigot I am what a bigot.

993
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,960
 We got a scooper coming at us today from Afro Scoop.

994
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,400
 The categories are Vegas, parking and weather.

995
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,720
 Hold on I'm trying to get you guys the screen at the same time that I'm talking and it's

996
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,720
 not working well.

997
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,480
 Vegas, parking and weather, driver trivia, team radio and interviews.

998
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,000
 I like how that Vegas, parking and weather bubble became big enough to hold the whole

999
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 thing.

1000
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 Yeah it kind of stretched itself out didn't it?

1001
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 That's kind of cool.

1002
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 I'll do Vegas, parking and weather for 200.

1003
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,240
 On what prominent Las Vegas strip properties parking lot was an F1 Grand Prix held between

1004
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,680
 1981 and 1984?

1005
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,280
 No options on this one.

1006
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,280
 Okay.

1007
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:36,800
 Strip properties parking lot, 81 to 84, it could be the MGM, it could be where they end

1008
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:49,720
 up putting the wet and wild, I don't know I'm going to pass though, Paul.

1009
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,840
 I feel like Flamingo or Caesars.

1010
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,800
 Okay.

1011
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,040
 But I don't know, I'll pass.

1012
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,040
 What happened?

1013
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,040
 Oh!

1014
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,040
 Somebody's not muted.

1015
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,760
 Somebody's not muted and it was really kind of kinky sounding.

1016
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,760
 It was interesting.

1017
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
 Yeah it was nice.

1018
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,760
 So are you passing Paul?

1019
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
 I am passing.

1020
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
 Matt?

1021
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,720
 Oh, I will do, I'll do Caesars.

1022
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,280
 Alright.

1023
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,280
 Caesars Palace.

1024
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,280
 Nice.

1025
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,280
 Bold.

1026
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,280
 Well done.

1027
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,800
 I should have guessed it.

1028
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:29,720
 I will take Team Radio.

1029
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,360
 For 200.

1030
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,200
 Oh!

1031
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,640
 There's a link in this question.

1032
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:45,480
 While in his car which was being pushed by mechanics to the Weybridge at the 2017 Azerbaijan

1033
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:51,120
 Grand Prix, what did Kimi Raekkonen demand?

1034
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,240
 An ice cream, his gloves, the steering wheel or Boa?

1035
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
 Boa?

1036
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,920
 Boa, I don't know.

1037
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,040
 I will guess an ice cream.

1038
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,120
 This question is a car wreck, it doesn't fit in the format, something's going on.

1039
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,720
 Yeah, I don't know, it was a steering wheel, he wanted a steering wheel.

1040
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,720
 Okay.

1041
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
 Yeah.

1042
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,720
 Matt?

1043
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,760
 I will do interviews for 200 please.

1044
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,080
 What were Ozzy Osbourne's dogs doing at home when he was interviewed on the grid by F1

1045
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,680
 presenter Martin Brundle?

1046
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,360
 Were they pissing, shitting, fucking or having makeovers with Sharon?

1047
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,760
 Well, I have a feeling if they were shitting we would know about it universally, so I'm

1048
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,520
 going to rule that one out.

1049
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
 Okay.

1050
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,640
 I'm also just going to make a quick note, don't include YouTube links in your scooperty

1051
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
 questions.

1052
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,640
 Yeah, we're not going to watch them.

1053
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,120
 We're not going to take the time to watch them.

1054
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,120
 I'm going to do having makeovers with Sharon.

1055
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
 Let's try it.

1056
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,120
 Nope, it was shitting.

1057
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,120
 And yet I haven't heard about it.

1058
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,120
 And yet I haven't heard about it.

1059
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,520
 And yet I haven't heard about it.

1060
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,840
 I have terrible friends, I should have known about this.

1061
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,960
 I still haven't watched the last Ozzy concert from a couple weeks ago, I'm still excited

1062
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,960
 to watch that.

1063
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,440
 That looks like it was an incredible event.

1064
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,160
 Yeah, I want to watch the whole fucking thing, I want to watch all the intro bands, there

1065
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,320
 are a lot of bands on the docket there that I really like a lot.

1066
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,840
 I can't wait to watch that.

1067
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,880
 Oh, let's see, I will try driver trivia for 200.

1068
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:32,920
 What unfortunate translation does Nicky Lotta's last name have in Hindi, boobs, ass, vagina

1069
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,160
 or penis?

1070
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,160
 Let's see.

1071
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:42,120
 I would like to stick my penis between your Lottas, I would like to stick my penis in

1072
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:48,320
 your Lottas, I would like for you to put your Lottas in my Lottas.

1073
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,220
 Get the ring rust off that Lottas.

1074
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,220
 Yeah.

1075
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,920
 I'm going to say vagina, I'm going to say C vagina.

1076
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,480
 No, it's the penis.

1077
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
 Oh, Nicky penis.

1078
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,480
 D penis.

1079
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,480
 D penis.

1080
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
 Paul.

1081
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,480
 D penis.

1082
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,480
 D penis.

1083
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,480
 I will take interviews.

1084
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,480
 I took my dog to the vet.

1085
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,480
 For 400.

1086
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
 And I got him to penis.

1087
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,480
 That's just rude.

1088
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,080
 It's a Daily Double.

1089
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,080
 Yeah, here we go.

1090
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,920
 Victory is at hand.

1091
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:26,660
 At the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, what did Kimi Rakanon tell Martin Brundle he was doing

1092
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,720
 when he missed Pele's presentation?

1093
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,200
 Was he having an ice cream, looking for his gloves and steering wheel, I still don't know

1094
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
 what that means.

1095
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,920
 Maybe, I don't know.

1096
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,120
 Or having a shit.

1097
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,600
 Having a shit.

1098
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,320
 D having a shit is correct.

1099
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
 Alright.

1100
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,280
 He was having a shit.

1101
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,680
 Alright, this is Martin Brundle likes his shitty stuff.

1102
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:00,320
 I will do Vegas parking weather, 400 please.

1103
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,620
 Since 2022, the first Grand Prix in the United States every season is held on the parking

1104
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:08,880
 lot of which Southern football team's parking lot.

1105
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,680
 No option on this one either.

1106
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,000
 Since 2022, this is Vegas parking weather, so is it the Raiders?

1107
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,840
 It's the Southern football team, so I don't see why this is Vegas parking weather.

1108
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,840
 I'm confused and I'm passing, Jacob.

1109
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:31,120
 Passes to me.

1110
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,960
 I think there's one in Houston.

1111
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,960
 I'm going to say Houston.

1112
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,960
 Miami.

1113
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,960
 Miami Dolphins.

1114
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,360
 Oh, Southern Bell, Miami.

1115
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,360
 That's right.

1116
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,120
 I mean, they are technically, definitely Southern.

1117
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,840
 About as South as you can get.

1118
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,320
 Let's see, I'll try Vegas parking weather for 600.

1119
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,180
 During the first run of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in the 80s, what weather conditions caused

1120
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,640
 significant problems for the teams?

1121
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,080
 It was raining men.

1122
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,880
 They wrote a whole song about it.

1123
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,840
 I bet it was rain.

1124
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,000
 The windshields just could not handle it though.

1125
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 They were cracking.

1126
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 It was everywhere.

1127
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 Yeah.

1128
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 I'll try rain.

1129
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,960
 Oh no, extreme heat.

1130
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,960
 Oh, what do you know?

1131
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,960
 In Vegas?

1132
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,960
 In Vegas?

1133
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
 Odd.

1134
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
 Yeah.

1135
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,240
 Country Scoop notes that "boah" is a Finnish accent and pronunciation of the word "yea,"

1136
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,960
 often associated with Kimi Räkonen for his stoic personality.

1137
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,960
 Okay.

1138
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,960
 Well, there you go.

1139
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,960
 All right.

1140
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,960
 Paul.

1141
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,320
 I will try Team Radio for 400 again.

1142
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:45,380
 When Sebastian Vettel was hit from behind by Daniel Ricciardo ... Sorry.

1143
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:52,080
 When Sebastian Vettel was hit from behind by Daniel Ricciardo, he exclaimed, "What are

1144
01:01:52,080 --> 01:02:00,040
 you doing here, racing or blank, NASCAR, WIFWAF, bumper cars, or ping pong?"

1145
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,560
 Also, I really like WIFWAF.

1146
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,560
 Yeah.

1147
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,320
 That's a fun phrase.

1148
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,320
 When I said WIFWAF, I thought I had mispronounced it and then looked back at it.

1149
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
 I was like, "Nope.

1150
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,680
 That's just how that's spelled, WIFWAF."

1151
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,240
 Is WIFWAF an actual thing?

1152
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
 It could be.

1153
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,240
 I don't know.

1154
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,400
 It could be a mispronunciation of riff raff.

1155
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,280
 Oh man, I really like him throwing NASCAR under the bus.

1156
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,480
 Oh yeah.

1157
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,040
 Oh, F1 people go after NASCAR.

1158
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,040
 Yeah.

1159
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,040
 It's great every time.

1160
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,960
 I think I'm going to go with A, NASCAR.

1161
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,240
 Let's try NASCAR.

1162
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,240
 Nope.

1163
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,240
 I'm sorry.

1164
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,240
 It's ping pong.

1165
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,240
 Oh.

1166
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,240
 Ping pong.

1167
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,960
 Would have also accepted WIFWAF, which of course, as we know, was the original name

1168
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,960
 for ping pong.

1169
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,680
 Did you guys see the new Godzilla movie?

1170
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
 No.

1171
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,680
 Oh wait.

1172
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,360
 Is that Godzilla minus one?

1173
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,360
 No, no, no.

1174
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,120
 The one with King Kong where he plays ping pong in Hong Kong with his ding dong.

1175
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
 No.

1176
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
 I did see that one.

1177
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,120
 Yeah.

1178
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:05,360
 I thought it was played WIFWAF with his half-staff in a spacecraft.

1179
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,080
 There it is.

1180
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,840
 Matt.

1181
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:16,120
 Oh, Godzilla in that stiff ass sock.

1182
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:22,680
 Gosh, I know so much about this topic that's in all four categories.

1183
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,680
 Yeah, yeah.

1184
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,560
 We're doing great at this.

1185
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,560
 Let's do Vegas.

1186
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,760
 By the way, Matt is leading with zero points.

1187
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,120
 But for long, let's do Vegas, parking and weather.

1188
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,780
 During the current run of the Las Vegas Grand Prix beginning in 2023, what weather conditions

1189
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,040
 have caused significant problems for the teams?

1190
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:52,960
 Tornado warning, extreme heat, extreme cold, or flash flooding?

1191
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,400
 I'm going to go with flash flooding.

1192
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,000
 Okay.

1193
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,560
 The first season, I remember they had cold problems.

1194
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,560
 Yeah.

1195
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,400
 Let's see here, I can get it.

1196
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,160
 Oh, extreme cold because someone decided it would be a good idea to hold the race at three

1197
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,200
 a.m. local time to cater to the European audience.

1198
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,640
 That was 10 p.m. local time.

1199
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,600
 It wasn't that ridiculous.

1201
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,000
 It was ridiculous, but not that ridiculous.

1202
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,640
 But it was enough to get it wrong and I joined the ranks with negative scores here in our

1203
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,640
 Grand Prix.

1204
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,640
 There we go.

1205
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,000
 Now Paul is in the lead with a negative 200.

1206
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,200
 This Grand Prix is now racing backwards.

1207
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,760
 The Grand Prix.

1208
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,440
 Let's see, I'll try interviews, 600.

1209
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,440
 I guess it doesn't matter.

1210
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,360
 Sneak bonus should be a question because I couldn't find another good interview moment.

1211
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,680
 Which country has the highest number of F1 drivers champions compared to its population?

1212
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:52,240
 Oh, so we're looking for the country with most F1 driver champions per capita.

1213
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,360
 Yes.

1214
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,120
 New Zealand, France, Finland or Great Britain.

1215
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
 Okay.

1216
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,120
 Let's see.

1217
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,480
 I mean, it's got to be New Zealand.

1218
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,480
 Or Finland.

1219
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,640
 There's like eight people that live in New Zealand if one of them ever won anything.

1220
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,640
 Oh boy.

1221
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,640
 Finland.

1222
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,640
 Same argument for Finland.

1223
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,640
 I'm going to New Zealand.

1224
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,640
 Hey.

1225
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,640
 That was Finland.

1226
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,640
 Oh.

1227
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,640
 Finland, Finland, Finland.

1228
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,640
 Paul even gave you a Paul clue.

1229
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,640
 The country where I like to race.

1230
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,720
 The country where I like to Grand Prix.

1231
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,680
 I will go team radio again.

1232
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,680
 Why not?

1233
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:32,740
 In the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix, what code did the Red Bull team give Sebastian Vettel

1234
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,700
 to signal that he shouldn't pass his teammate, Mark Webber, a signal which he ignored going

1235
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,040
 on to make the pass later on for his team?

1236
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,040
 Probably.

1237
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
 Yeah.

1238
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:50,320
 So what was the signal, Paul?

1239
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
 Yellow flag.

1240
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
 I don't know.

1241
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,320
 I don't know.

1242
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,320
 Let's try it.

1243
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,320
 I'll.

1244
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,320
 Multi-map to one.

1245
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,040
 Oh, I guess there were answers that got cut off too.

1246
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
 Okay.

1247
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,400
 Oh, oh, oh, great.

1248
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,400
 So there were.

1249
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
 Yeah.

1250
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,400
 There were multiple choice answers.

1251
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,400
 It got cut off.

1252
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,600
 Oh, you know, Paul just pulled it on.

1253
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,920
 That should have been easier, Paul.

1254
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,200
 A little whiff whaff formattingly on that one.

1255
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,680
 I'll take it.

1256
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,640
 I'll take a whiff whaff right on the chin.

1257
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,960
 You know, even though it feels like the scooper is taking decades, we did get whiff whaff out

1258
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,960
 of it.

1259
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,960
 And so.

1260
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,960
 Yeah.

1261
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,960
 It's still a win.

1262
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,960
 It's still a win for the show.

1263
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,960
 We're batting a thousand.

1264
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,560
 It's absolutely a win.

1265
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:33,080
 And people are watching, so who cares?

1266
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,560
 Other people are suffering with us.

1267
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,960
 They have equally confused looks on their face as we do.

1268
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,000
 Let's just let's just keep answering shit every time.

1269
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,880
 Matt, you're up.

1270
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,400
 What are the scores, Jacob?

1271
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,960
 I don't know what I'm chasing here.

1272
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,560
 Oh, let's see here.

1273
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,820
 Oh, good news, Matt.

1274
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,040
 You and Paul are tied for the lead at negative 800.

1275
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,680
 I'm right behind you, though.

1276
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,680
 Negative 1800.

1277
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,680
 Okay.

1278
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,680
 It's anyone's game.

1279
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,680
 Creepin'.

1280
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,720
 As we head to the final lap, I will take driver trivia for 400 since I don't know anything

1281
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,720
 about anyone.

1282
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,460
 Which of these totally real names belongs to a current F1 driver?

1283
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:14,080
 Scott Speed, Will Power, Lando Norris, or Stingray Robb?

1284
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,240
 C, Lando Norris.

1285
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,080
 Lando Norris is correct.

1286
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,560
 Scott Speed is an ex-F1 driver, while Willie Pete and Stingray are IndyCar drivers.

1287
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,840
 Hat tip goes to the greatest name in all motorsports, NASCAR's own Dick Trickle.

1288
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,240
 One hundred percent correct.

1289
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,240
 Yeah.

1290
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,240
 Yes.

1291
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,240
 It's me.

1292
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,240
 I'll try.

1293
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,240
 Well, let's see.

1294
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,240
 What do I need?

1295
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,240
 I need all the points.

1296
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,400
 Driver trivia, 800.

1297
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,160
 What surname does a prominent scoop who is often mentioned and even has guested on ICS

1298
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:50,640
 a few times share with the former F1 driver with the first name Antonio and nickname Italian

1299
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,640
 Jesus?

1300
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,600
 Italian should be clue enough.

1301
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:02,040
 A prominent scoop.

1302
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,080
 What name does he share?

1303
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,160
 That's got to be Scoop Jesus.

1304
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,920
 I think we'll just go Scoop Jesus.

1305
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
 That'll be it.

1306
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,920
 I don't fucking know.

1307
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,920
 I'll pass.

1308
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,920
 Paul.

1309
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,920
 I don't know.

1310
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,920
 Matt.

1311
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,920
 I'm trying to think of Italian names.

1312
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,280
 I mean, Sloanina comes on a lot, but I wouldn't know if you count it as a prominent scoop.

1313
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,200
 Giovinazzi sounds Italian, but it's Australian.

1314
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,200
 Right.

1315
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
 Ah.

1316
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,200
 I don't know.

1317
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,720
 I'll pass.

1318
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,720
 Let's see.

1319
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,560
 Well, I'm not doing well.

1320
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,040
 Oh my God.

1321
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,040
 Giovinazzi.

1322
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
 It was Giovinazzi.

1323
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,040
 Oh, look at that.

1324
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,560
 Apparently there were multiple choice questions on that as well.

1325
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,560
 Paul.

1326
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:51,200
 You know, if you don't put YouTube links in the question, it leaves plenty of room for

1327
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,200
 the other parts.

1328
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,400
 It does.

1329
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,880
 I will try interviews.

1330
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,880
 What the hell?

1331
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,880
 Why not?

1332
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,880
 Daily double.

1333
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,880
 There we go.

1334
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,880
 Yeah.

1335
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,760
 Gentlemen, a short view back to the past.

1336
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:15,640
 30 years ago, Nicky Laura told us take a place, take a comma place him into the cockpit and

1337
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,240
 he is able to drive the car.

1338
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:24,960
 30 years later, Sebastian told us quote, I had, and then there's the letter T and then

1339
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,400
 the rest of it is cut off.

1340
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,420
 Paul, what do you believe is the answer to this daily double question?

1341
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,960
 I'm going to say monkey.

1342
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,320
 Let's try it.

1343
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,600
 It's monkey.

1344
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,600
 Amazing.

1345
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
 It's monkey.

1346
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
 Yeah.

1347
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
 Yeah.

1348
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
 How is it monkey?

1349
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
 How the hell?

1350
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,600
 Where did that question go?

1351
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,240
 Because contextual clues.

1352
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,680
 Take a blank, place him into the cockpit and he's able to drive the car.

1353
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,880
 He's clearly describing the ease of some vehicle or something like that.

1354
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,880
 Paul wrote this scooper day is what happened.

1355
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,760
 I did not write this scooper day, but when in doubt, guess monkey is right.

1356
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,880
 By the way, the chat is letting me know apologies, Jimmy Slonina for calling him not a prominent

1357
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,880
 scoop.

1358
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
 I misspoke.

1359
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,200
 What I meant to say is that he was such a, he's more of a guest and friend than a scoop

1360
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,960
 in my brain.

1361
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,840
 I also just say this is obviously no matter what, even with the apology, this is the worst

1362
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,320
 thing to happen to Jimmy Slonina this month.

1363
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:35,080
 So there you go.

1364
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,320
 Matt, you got driver trivia or team radio.

1365
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,480
 You're only 400 points behind Paul, buddy.

1366
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,480
 Oh man.

1367
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,640
 I'll go with a driver trivia.

1368
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:53,960
 For 600, Fernando Alonzo is the most experienced F1 driver on record with a career spanning

1369
01:10:53,960 --> 01:11:00,640
 20 years between 2003 and 2025, including a two year hiatus, give or take two.

1370
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:07,040
 How many drivers in the 25 season were born after the start of his career?

1371
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,800
 Oh man.

1372
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:15,360
 I still think a monkey is a viable answer, man.

1373
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,640
 Two shitting monkeys.

1374
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,640
 Ah ha ha.

1375
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:25,160
 Oh God damn.

1376
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,800
 I don't fucking know.

1377
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,800
 Pass.

1378
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,840
 Let's see.

1379
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
 That passes to me.

1380
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,960
 12, 12 is the answer.

1381
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,960
 Good guess.

1382
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,960
 Five.

1383
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
 Pretty good.

1384
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,960
 Pretty close, Jacob.

1385
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,960
 Horseshoes and hand grenades.

1386
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:47,200
 I'm closing out the category and thankfully the game team radio for 800.

1387
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,440
 In a period when team orders, the team telling teammates to swap positions or not race each

1388
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,640
 other were banned, what super secret coded message did the Ferrari team give Felipe Massa

1389
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,680
 during the 2010 and then the question gets cut off?

1390
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:07,240
 They told him, they told him don't shit on the monkey.

1391
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,240
 It makes him mad.

1392
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
 It's a monkey.

1393
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,240
 It's a monkey.

1394
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,240
 Shit some monkey.

1395
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,240
 Let's see here.

1396
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,240
 Okay.

1397
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,800
 So Fernando is faster than you.

1398
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,000
 Can you confirm you understood that message?

1399
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,280
 It looks like I got that one wrong.

1400
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,280
 Yeah, that was D.

1401
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,080
 By the way, if we had seen questions, if we'd seen possible answers, that was the D answer.

1402
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,080
 Okay.

1403
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:33,480
 And that was from Afro Scoop, Paul wins with zero.

1404
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,480
 I don't care.

1405
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,480
 That was fucking great.

1406
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
 That's insane with negative 400.

1407
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,840
 I'm in third with negative 3,200.

1408
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,040
 Thank you so much Afro Scoop for sending that in.

1409
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,080
 HeyScoops.com, that's where you can go.

1410
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,360
 Send us some scoop mail, send us some scooperies, send us the jock vs nerds, send us everything

1411
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,360
 over there.

1412
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,360
 Right at HeyScoops.com.

1413
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,560
 What else can you do over there?

1414
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,800
 I'll tell you what you can do over there.

1415
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,880
 You can buy some tickets to Scoop Fest.

1416
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,840
 That's what you can do.

1417
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,360
 We got some whiff whiff out of that and we got Paul just saying the word monkey and getting

1418
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,880
 it correct out of fucking nowhere.

1419
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,880
 So it's a pretty...

1420
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,880
 Yeah.

1421
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
 Two shitting monkeys.

1422
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,880
 Two shitting monkeys.

1423
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,960
 And a partridge in a pear tree.

1424
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,960
 Monkey!

1425
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,320
 ScoopFest.com has the tickets there, go there and check it out.

1426
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,320
 Yes!

1427
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,880
 We have some really fun surprises for you guys.

1428
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,320
 Trivia battles are going to be awesome.

1429
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,960
 Jock vs nerd ball, mouth, finger, butthole, it's going to be great.

1430
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,680
 So get on out to ScoopFest last weekend of September, September 25th through the 27th.

1431
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,920
 I'm telling you right now, it is close enough that I am starting to panic.

1432
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,920
 Yeah.

1433
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,800
 Yeah, it's close enough that I'm starting to send out travel funds for our guests.

1434
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
 Yes!

1435
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,800
 Oh yeah.

1436
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:49,600
 Celebrity guests, we got celebrity guests, we got lovely swag.

1437
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,280
 Just get on board.

1438
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,280
 Come join the fun.

1439
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:57,280
 Get that scooperty that we just played again and we're going to see how much better we

1440
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,280
 do.

1441
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,280
 Yeah, yeah.

1442
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,280
 I think the scores would probably stay close to the same.

1443
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,360
 We're going to play that same scooperty, but we're also going to play every YouTube clip

1444
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,360
 also.

1445
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,360
 So that'll be good.

1446
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,160
 I want to thank all the people who support us over on our Patreon page.

1447
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,160
 Absolutely.

1448
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,160
 I have a specific list even.

1449
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
 You guys are going to love it.

1450
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,160
 Oh, this list.

1451
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,160
 No one's ever done a better list.

1452
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:28,360
 All right, I want to thank the following people who all blew out their monkey's asshole with

1453
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,280

 Real Good.

1464
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:37,280
 Some of those that are on here twice, I didn't read them twice, I think there's something

1465
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,640
 happened in the extraction of the list.

1466
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,640
 They're doubled up a lot on mine too.

1467
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,640
 I just say one of them.

1468
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1469
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,640
 I like saying twice.

1470
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,640
 I don't know if it's extraction or if it's just my part.

1471
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,720
 I think it's like a lucky thing.

1472
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,720
 Rub it in, buddy.

1473
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,920
 I think it's a lucky thing.

1474
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,920
 It's a lucky thing.

1475
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,480
 Paul, you do whatever you want.

1476
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,480
 Of course.

1477
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,480
 Yeah.

1478
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,480
 Of course.

1479
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,920
 I wasn't telling you to do whatever you want.

1480
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,920
 I was making a statement.

1481
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:08,040
