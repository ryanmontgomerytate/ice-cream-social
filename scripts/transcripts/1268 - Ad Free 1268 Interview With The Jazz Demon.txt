Oh, hello there, I am so happy you're here because I wanna thank the Ice Cream Truck Drivers. Thank you so much, Ice Cream Truck Drivers. It's a new month, we don't have a new list yet. Happy December, by the way, but we won't thank each and every Ice Cream Truck Driver at this part of a future show. I met the lost Ice Cream Truck Driver last night. She came to the show and introduced herself to me personally. I was so happy to meet an Ice Cream Truck Driver. If you wanna meet an Ice Cream Truck Driver, if you wanna be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, if you wanna meet one, it's easier. But if you wanna be one, preachyfun.com, preachyfun.com is where you can go to sign up to be an Ice Cream Truck Driver, and who knows? The life you save may be your own. Ow, it's a show. Hey Johnny, you wanna go to an Ice Cream Social? Yeah, I'd love to. Great, let's go. Mike Jones is here, the jazz demon. I am. It's time for Matt Manley's Ice Cream Social, sitting in Pittsburgh, PA, that's Paul Mattingly. Sitting at sea, it's Matt Donnelly. In Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob, the audio guy. We're preaching fun. We're preaching fun. Greetings from the ocean. Yes. Ahoy. Ahoy indeed. Mike, do people still call you the jazz demon? And when did first people start calling you that? It was as a small child. It was on my second birthday. It was a rainy evening. It was after the second conviction for arson. No, of course that was, I believe that was, Zeke Zabrowski from the Penn and Teller show back when he was a young child. He started calling me the jazz demon very early on in my career with Penn and Teller, and Penn latched onto it and still uses it every night in the show. And I have a jazz demon license plate. So I can't get rid of it now. Oh, yeah, you're stuck with it now. Oh, it's more, it's more horrific than that because you can only use how many, whatever, seven letters. So I decided to use J-A-Z-Z-D-M-N because I thought J-Z-Z-D-M-O-N might be a different connotation, not on a B, G-S-D-N-O. So I went with jazz demon, but then I get these people to say, jazz demand, what does that mean? And so I just ignore people. Do people stop you and talk to you about your license plate all the time? I feel like this is something that happens in Las Vegas, is people discuss other people's license plates. Yeah, it's happened more than once, which is one time too many. No, it's fine. It bothers me when I come up behind people and I can't figure out what their plate's supposed to mean. It always means jizz on my penis, that's what it means. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But it's been, yeah, it's been 25 years. I don't use it myself, you know, hey, how you doing? I'm the jazz demon. Never introduced myself that way. However, I'm not offended when others refer to me as that, but yeah, it's been, but Zeke came up with that because you know, metal, right? I guess more metal is better. He keeps wanting me to start the piano on fire and play a lot of metal music, but I won't do it. Great balls of fire. No, no, he wants like, I don't know, mega death. He wants some mega death covers with the piano burning. I think that'd be a fun new addition to the pre-show at Penn & Teller. Don't give them any ideas. Have you ever played any kind of stunt piano for any kind of gig? I have not, luckily. I mean, in my youth, I would do my Jerry Lee Lewis impersonation and hit the piano with my feet and stuff like that. But no, I try to respect the instrument. You know, when I would play in like lounges and some asshole would set his drink on the piano right in front of me while I'm playing a song, I would scream, it's not furniture, asshole. You know? You want to set your drink on somebody's violin? Really smart, thanks. But, and that got me a lot of tips, you know? That's why I was so successful. Hey, could you play some Billy Joe? Why don't you fuck off? No. Our piano player here is great. He takes requests, but only the requests he wants to take. Exactly. Our musical director, Mike, at the Second City, he, you know, they had a piano that was there on the stage all the time. And this was when we were sharing the stage with the expert-less dancers. So they would come in and do the show late night after we were done. And there was one day we came in for rehearsal and there was an unmistakable coochie print right on the piano top that you just couldn't get away from. And we all just spent the day kind of oogling it. Mike just kind of had to play around it. Oogling it. You didn't clean it? No, we didn't clean it. You didn't go get some fucking furniture spray. Man, it's like Jesus' face in a piece of toast or something, you don't fucking have that shit. You guys just kept taking turns blindfolding each other, playing pin the clip on the pussy. And you just kind of just go around and see if you can. Yeah, so there's definitely lots of respect for the instrument out here in Las Vegas. Yeah, yeah. I had a bit of a reputation because many, many years ago, this is way before the internet times, there was a cartoon in the New Yorker that showed a guy playing like cocktail piano. And it's in the caption underneath was, you people make me sick. Nevertheless, here's another toe tapper. There it is. That's great. A bunch of people, I got like seven copies of that in the mail to me. Sure. So I guess I had a reputation. Friends know you, I'm suffering a bad. Now at this point, you've been with the Penn and Teller show for quite a while. There have been many different iterations of the stage there. Have you ever considered talking them into maybe having a Batman like secret two key press that would then sink your piano into the stage or open up a secret window? Yeah. Teller has been talking for years about wanting to make the piano float somehow over the stage. I think hopefully they've gotten that out of there that's passed them by. But I think they were, I'm hoping they'll age out of that idea. It's, I've been with them almost half their career now. 25 years almost. And it's great about, I don't know, well, I'm bad with time now, but several years ago, they surprised me with a Mike Jones corner on the right side of the stage with the neon sign and the Mike Jones duo. And, but yeah, I'm happy with the piano staying. And also just from a practical standpoint, you can't. Whoa. That is very practical. Those are, that's our sound effect for telling you to get the fuck out of here, Mike. Take your directions and go. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Technical issues on our side. So yeah, you had the surprise of the reveal of the corner there dedicated to you. Yeah, that was nice. But I don't think you really should move a piano often because it's... I try not to. Yeah, well, they're heavy and also they go out of tune. I didn't think about that. But I think the teller's idea may be more in line with having a car appear on stage, you know what I mean? So I leave that up to them. But I'll play wherever they put me. When I, I've been doing these 50th anniversary gigs with them and it's been really fun. And we were doing Boston a couple of weeks ago and Glenn said, what if we put you up in one of the boxes? And I said, well, I'd sort of prefer to be on the stage. I felt like, okay. And so they made it work, but it was great. But, you know, there are, there are shows, as you guys know, many, many shows now, the orchestra is not in the same theater as the performance. They're in a, you know, they're in a basement somewhere and I, you know, and it's, I sort of draw the line there, you know? If I'm appearing with Ben and Tyler, I'd like to be in the same building. I'm often disappointed when I find that the orchestra is in a different space, like in a room next door. Yeah, it's, the first time I came across that was many years ago, there was a puppet show, Avenue Q, I think it was, at the Wynn. And I went to it and they're like, and look out up on the TV, there's our guys in a suite four, you know, four floors away. And I was like, oh, that's kind of a rip-off. And I was crazy too, because in that room we had an orchestra pit, we just didn't use it for Avenue Q. Too good for them. That's right. That's right. That's weird. For Spamalot, right after Avenue Q, we had like 28 orchestra members down in the, in the orchestra pit right there. I don't know why it didn't get used for Avenue Q. Yeah, they, they name it an orchestra pit because there's an orchestra in it, you know? But I don't want to put you in a suite and keep you away from people. You don't want to be in allusions with pianos. What allusions do you want to be a part of, Mike? All of them. I'll do anything. Can we get you in Georgie's Queen of Hearts dress for the, for that one bit? Can we get you in the picture? Yeah, yeah, I, you know, I, I, it's funny. Someone just asked me last night at the show, are you part of any of the tricks? And I don't think that there's, there's never been a trick that I've been a part of except for doing all the music. And I mean, and also the girl, the gorilla where I did the narration, which was actually fun, which I had like a whole thing alive, alive, alive. You know, and on the inside, Zomofo, the gorilla girl. And I did a whole carnival barking thing while I played like silent movie music. But mostly, I mean, and air sacs. I mean, we were, I was in center stage for that with Brian. But yeah, but I mean, they're not asking me to, you know, do any tricky shuffling or, hey, let's, you know, come on up for this trick. And let's let our piano player shuffle these cards. I think you would have made a really great ball pitch roll. Oh yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. I remember that, that was a bit that was done. Oh, what? Twice? Twice, yeah. Well, it was not, it was, it was a teed up. If you see it on the Fula show, it's my son. Oh, I know, I was there. I was playing the ball control music. I'm also talking to the audience listening to our podcast. Oh, oh, oh, you have listeners? At minimum, the ones that are here now. I'm working on that. And we found it on the internet at the end of the day. And they're like, do they still do that bit? I was like, they never did that bit. This was it. I was like, you are the only ball pitch roll, buddy. Yeah, I think that there's only, I don't, there's not many tricks, not many bits that they've only done that limited amount of times, except for stuff that they did, especially for television. I think specifically it was done the year before COVID. So their ambition for it was to do it in the summertime where they got more families visiting. Yeah, I remember. They were actually going to recruit a kid each show before it happened. And then COVID happened, and then three seasons of Fula's happened. So by the time the show came back, they weren't like, let's dust off that old chestnut. Yeah, that's in one of our videos. I was like, I'm back in there. You know, and the crew loves it. Yeah. Cleaning up all those balls and setting up the perimeter and getting a kid to do magic. Yeah. I want to ask about it. He's like, oh, I would love to have done it again. And he is now like two feet taller than he was when he did it. Right. You can't do it again, everybody. Get in the thing. Yeah. You're out. You are out. It's over. Yeah, it's over. That part of your life is done. Well, I, yeah, I walked by a couple of months ago. I walked by Robbie Living, like after the end of Haystack, and he's like, you know, sweeping the hay up. And I said, the glamour of showbiz, you know, like he's, you know, picking up piles of hay and pulling cards out of it, you know. But there's a lot of... Tell us the story to Jessica Jane and I. He was talking about they were working on Broadway and he had like a boil on like the inside of his thigh or whatever. And it was, his costume was irritating him, especially after they did water tank or something. So he's doing a change. They said they had this flamboyant customer on Broadway who basically had to help tell her pop the boil. Oh, boy. Yeah. And he said he just looked at the teller. Dressers and wardrobe people on Broadway go above and beyond. Above and beyond, right? And he said he just looked at the teller from down on his knees going, ah, showbiz, the tinsel in the glamour. That's disgusting. Oh, yeah, the glamour made me laugh so hard. Jonesy, you are a podcaster now. I am a podcaster in conjunction with the great Jennifer Zabel. She's actually running everything. Yeah, yeah, she's she makes it happen. But I it's, you know, it's you've been on it. It's now actually a thing. It's I just started talking to people that I knew about music and what they liked and music in their lives. And, you know, I had these. I had the idea came through working with David Silverman from The Simpsons because obviously he's not known as a musician. He's known as a great animator and and he but he he's a serious tuba guy and he plays the tuba. And so I said, you know, and then Bill Prady, who does the Big Bang Theory, who wrote that show and many, many others, he started playing the saxophone like when he was 60. Wow. And I said, you know, I know all these people. Yeah, I know all these people that that that music is important to them, even though they're not known for music. And so that's sort of opened the door. And then I started talking with more musicians and also a lot of critics and people that are around music. And I just did I'm very excited. I just did a great conversation with Eric, Eric Mingus, who's Charles Mingus's son. And you know, you don't get much higher up in the jazz royals even Mingus and your stories of him growing up and being there when Mingus met Joni Mitchell. And, you know, it's it's really cool. I mean, I'm enjoying it. I mean, maybe maybe my audience is 10 people. But I'm loving it, you know, you should have Jacob want to talk about kiss because he loves kiss. Yeah, yeah, I know. I mean, that's I'm not, you know, I've I've had I had Scotty Meltzer on. He was a juggler and and I just said, you've got the worst taste in music of anyone I've ever met. Tell us about it. And he did, you know, and it was great. But this is worth some good dose. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's impossible. That can't be true. No, it's true. I mean, the only difference between Scotty and Godot is and I will give Scotty the edge on this. I believe Scotty can also appreciate good music better than Godot. You know what I mean? I I think I think Godot has just got, you know, really pedestrian music and and, you know. And you're right. He just doesn't care. Yeah. But Scotty, he actively seeks out every horrific show tune you've ever heard. And and, you know, he was he was in he was like a musical kid. He was in like, you know, musicals as a child and stuff. And it's just so deeply disturbing. I was in a lot of musicals as a child. I don't listen only to show tunes, though. I listen to other music. He can appreciate Miles Davis, too. But I don't think Godot cares whether it's Miles Davis or or Bette Midler. You know what I mean? Um, but so I give Scotty the advantage there. But but but my point is that everybody's got really not everybody. But most people have the people I want to talk to have really interesting stories about growing up with it and what they listen to as kids and how they got into music. And sort of when they realized that music, they were listening to music different than all their classmates. You know what I mean? The music became more important to them, usually at an earlier age than than every than most people. Because I as I used to have to tell my father, who always promoted me, oh, my son's a great jazz piano player. I'd say nobody cares about jazz, dad. And even less people care about solo piano in jazz. So, you know, I'm looking for the people that care about that stuff that are also creative in other ways, writers, you know, and everybody. I mean, just, you know, if you've got interesting stories to talk about, kiss, I want to hear them, you know? I mean, you know, Matt and I talked about some guy from Jersey, some singer, singer, songwriter, Southside Johnny. Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. We did an hour. We did an hour on Southside Johnny. But but that's been a lot of fun. It's really it's it's the stereo image. It's called the stereo image. Stereo image. And we got a great logo done by Matt Rockman, who's doing all the stuff for Penn and Teller these days. And he came up with this really cool, like it's like 3D glasses with the VU meters on it. And it's really because it's sort of retro and it's sort of, you know, it's got a little bit of everything. And the stereo image is on all platforms or the stereo image dot com. And I'm going to do I'm doing Oscar Peterson's daughter next week. She's got great stories. Yeah, I mean, we're really getting I've got I if I were smart, I would have the list of people we've done in front of me, but I don't. But no one's that smart. No, it's OK. Well, I'm, you know, it's but it's Piff and Jade on. It's I had Piff and Jade on and it was hysterical because we did it from the Piff we did our first remote podcast from Piff's lair. Oh, nice cave. Yeah. And it was it was it was a control freak like Piff, making sure that you did it in his studio, not yours. Well, Piff. So I like him. Piff has. Horrific taste. That's what I was curious about. Yeah, I know he likes him. He likes don't know what music he likes. He likes suicidal coffee shop, plaintive, plaintive whaling, singer, songwriter, 18 year old. My boyfriend left me and I kill myself. Music he lives the most practicing. It's it's I mean, and he loves it and he just listens to it, I guess according to Jade all the time. But yeah, we we did it. Yeah, well, we did Dara Godfried. We did, you know, I talked about Gilbert's song. And I mean, we did a lot. I mean, we've got about maybe like 30, 30 done so far. But but I'm looking at Gilbert's taste of music. Gilbert, I don't I don't know if we did. I we did have her very early on. Um, I don't know. We talked about Gilbert's podcast, of course, which was great. Yes, he didn't really we didn't really talk about his music taste. I don't I don't know if Gilbert knew music existed. Yeah, I'm very curious about that. I'll tell you one thing. I'll tell you a Gilbert story. I I was at so Gilbert was over at my house. This is 20 years ago, 15 years ago, and we're just hanging out. And I told our friend, Michael Lynn, we had a mutual friend, Mickey Lynn, whose whose father had passed away. And he asked me, Mickey, his father loved Mark's brothers. And he asked me if I would play a version of hello, I must be going for him to play at the funeral and recorded for him. So I did, you know, and I was telling Gilbert that story, who knew who knew Mickey as well. And all of a sudden, Gilbert launches into a perfect rendition of of old groucho singing, hello, I must be going. And I totally spaced that Gilbert did perfect groucho. It was like young groucho. You bet your life groucho and old groucho. And he's just walking around my kitchen like, hello, I must be going. You know, and I just lost it. I was like, oh, fuck, you know, I forgot you're a genius. But he's my favorite impersonation. One of my favorites was his impersonation of Penn. Because we're at lunch one day and he's and he's sitting there. And all of a sudden, Gilbert's just looking at the table. We're waiting for the waiters to come over and there's these salt shakers, salt and pepper shakers. And he goes, oh, salt, salt, oh, let's look at the salt today this week. And then he goes into Penn and he goes this week on bullshit. We've got the National Salt Association because salt is pro salt. And then we've got the Anti-Salt Association. Salt is bullshit. He did five minutes of Penn talking about salt and it was just genius. But yeah, he I'm missing that he was great. But anyhow, but we got off. But yeah, the podcast is great and everyone should listen and subscribe and make me famous and then also because, you know, how long can I play this piano? I really belong in podcasting. Um, the non stop world of podcasting. That's right. Uh, do you really see like a world where you use your, your, your, you don't play piano? Yeah, that world is when I'm dead. That's what I thought. Yeah, I often want to be, I want to be like the 93 year old guy that they wheel out in a wheelchair chair and say, you know, jazz legend Mike Jones and I, and I eat a little pudding and I play a couple of songs and he's like, isn't it amazing? He could still play at this age. Okay, get him off the stage. You know, that's, that's what I see my, my golden years. I just saw a video, a TikTok with an elderly woman who's suffering from dementia. She's I believe 93. And maybe you saw this, Jonesy, but she's a classically trained pianist, but she doesn't remember that she's a classically trained pianist anymore. However, they consider in front of a piano and say, could you play such and such? And she's like, well, I don't know it, but then she'll do it. You know, right? I have seen it. Yeah, it's remarkable at the way there it is, the way music acts in the brain is something special. Oh, it is. Jonesy, would that be better or worse than current life? Would it be better or worse? I think you could still play anything, any piece of music that you could play now, you can play it, but you don't remember any of the music. So you don't have to think about any of the music. I love life. This is a dream. I I just want to I just want to sit somewhere and have them give me pudding. And that's that's really all I want. I don't really care about pudding. But but I'm we're used to you were saying something, Matt. Yeah, well, two different ways. One, I think you're the kind of kid that you didn't have to be like encouraged, like your parents enough like overly encouraged you to take piano. If anything, they took piano away from you as a punishment. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I was when I was like two and a half. My brother, who's five years older, was taking lessons. And I guess I would crawl up on the piano bench and play what he had been practicing. And so my parents unfortunately thought, well, we can make money off this kid. We'll send him to less, you know. And no, they just they just they always encouraged me. I had two player pianos in my house. So it was always around and it's all I wanted to do. And when I was in the third grade, my piano teacher said, you know, I don't ever get up before 10 or 11 in the morning. And that was a job for me. You were like, I can do that. Yeah, I hated getting up in the morning. Now, wait a minute. You said you had to play your pianos. Yeah, you know, the you know, the like with the scrolls, with the scroll and paper running through it and everything. Now they're now they're all, you know, now they're like Yamaha, Disclavier, and they don't know it's all it's all. But yes, in the olden days, it was a paper roll and it would go over a vacuum system that would cause the keys to go up and down. And we had an upright piano in my basement. And then in my living room, when I was about probably six or seven, my dad bought what was called a reproducing grand, which would 1926 when it was made, was the state of the art for rich people. It these may they made these roles. They were called expression pianos and they got louder and softer and sustained. So it didn't sound mechanical like a player piano. Oh, right. Like so I grew up with George Gershwin playing Rhapsody in Blue as if he was sitting at the piano in my house playing it. And they made a, you know, there was a company called Dewart and Ampico and Welty Mignon. And they were all these, they made these for the super rich. You know, I mean, when you're watching or when you're seeing that happen on that that piano machine, are you beyond just hearing the intonations and the ups and downs and the very, you know, the very nuanced playing of these masters? Are you also able to pick up on the mechanics of it? Does it does it come through and like the pedal step moves and all that kind of thing too? The pedal doesn't move, but the keys obviously go up and down. But were you able to study that was was that it was great? Yeah, because like if I put a Fats Waller piano roll on and I wanted to see what he was doing with his left hand, although it was many, many years, maybe like till I was 11 or 12, when it dawned on me, wait a minute, sometimes there's 11 keys going down. Maybe there's more than one person playing here. Then I found out it was well, they would double track them. Oh, wow. They would, you know, they would wait. And I've made piano rolls. I got to go to Q.R.S. And make piano wasn't the same piano that Duke Ellington and and and Ella Fitzgerald and Rachmaninoff and everybody played. Is there like a whole bunch connected to the to the piano key as well? No, it was more crazy than that. It's ink things. So the sheet of paper goes through, you press the keys down, it puts ink on the paper and then somebody stands, somebody sits there and cuts out a master roll by hand. Not at all. And then they then they make the master roll and then they produce them from that. So it's it's amazing. And I mean, at a time they had like 40 people in a room cutting out master rolls every day because it was so popular in the 20s and 30s. You know, and it's incredible. Yeah, it was really, really, really, you know, like old timey technology. And but the piano was so cool because it was an old, I think it was a Steinway. But it had been played so much that the ivory keys were all like scalloped in. Yeah. So that, you know, it was like soft, you know, there was there was like that much, wow, taken down on the keys just from the millions of people that played it out for 100 years. Yeah. And and like the little lip on the edge of the key is just completely gone. Like that little lip is worn away. Yeah, it's worn away from ivory. And and I think it's in the Smithsonian now. But but it's it was really cool in the 80s. The guy actually turns out that because they let black people play the piano, it had to be taken out. They took it to display down. Ah, yeah, that's a good job, man. It happens. It happens. Ouch. But anyways, so that's yeah, I've been, you know, so no, I was I I want to play, you know, I mean, as they say, I'll play till I drop dead, you know, if I can't like arthritis or I'd rather not have that. No, I actually, I mean, certainly I have I'm always on the edge. Um, I I I have I can I have like some tendinitis and some carpal tunnel, but not not to where it's affecting me. And I think the reason it doesn't is because I play so much. Um, but you don't relax long enough for it to set in. Well, what happens is, um, yeah, um, I take tumor turmeric and glucose amine and chondroitin and, you know, to stave off stuff like that. But what what what one of the great things about playing with the show on their fiftieth about five in the last five years, they develop this new technology for I couldn't play a keyboard ever. That was why it was always we can't take you on the road because we you can't play a keyboard because when you play a keyboard real quickly on pianists will notice. There's a there's a thing I think it's called the escapement at the bottom of when you press a piano down, if you press a piano key down very slowly, there'll be this little hitch at the very bottom and then it goes to the bottom. And that absorbs all the shock of the piano key hitting the bottom of the key bed. And even though they developed weighted keys for keyboards, there was never that kind of cushion. So your arm absorbed the entire shock of the of the key hitting and it would set me off in 20 minutes. And I never realized that. That's crazy. Yeah. And just in the last five years, Yamaha and Kawhi developed this new technology in their keyboards that has that feel. And I can play them all day and it doesn't bother me at all. And and it's actually better for the show because they don't have to mic the piano when I get there or anything like that. They just I mean, it's not the same as an acoustic seven foot piano, but it's really close enough for for for them. And and I like playing it. So so Kawhi is, you know, I'm a Kawhi artist and they just have one there for me. It's really great. Did you hear how he said it was good enough for them? It's good enough. Well, no, I mean, yeah, it's good enough for a magic show. All right. For the people setting up this fucking keyboard that don't want to go to the trouble of setting up a piano like a person. That's right. It's good enough for it. Also, it also means that the floating piano allusions back on the table. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Have you got a piano? We don't knock it out of tune. You don't want to, you don't want to move that piano around. I'm happy to be in the floating piano allusion. I'm very happy to be in it. I just don't want to be responsible for it. I don't want to have to tune the piano after it's done. Yeah, yeah, it's like I had this stupid idea for Andy Cheek in the chat. Kiss fans won't hear the difference. Fuck you, Andy Cheek. Tough talk. Wow. You know, some coming from the blood. Some of the 100 members of Kiss of the past two centuries actually know more than two cores. That's true. Well, no, Ace Fraley died. So it's not anymore. Yeah. Yeah. But it's anyhow. Yeah, the piano with the piano situation has gotten really good finally. But so my hands don't hurt. You know, I'm really lucky. I mean, I I've been playing for I've been playing the piano for almost 60 years. But you know, and and a lot of old piano players that I've known over the years, you know, have not had problems with arthritis. But then again, like Oscar had it really bad, Oscar Peterson, and they just play through it, you know. But I've been lucky. I mean, I still have most of my faculties, not mental at all. I'm but overrated. But in anyways, and so if this is going out, but I will self promotion to jump off. If this is if anyone's hearing this on Monday in Vegas and have nothing to do tonight, meaning Monday, go down to Vicks at 7 p.m. Because I'm recording two different live albums in one night. Oh, nice. Or so 9 p.m. Two for the second set. Vicks downtown by the Smith Center. Yes. Oh, I would have put this here. I thought I thought this episode was coming out too late. It's coming out. Oh, no, it's no, it's it's Monday night. OK, tonight. Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, and it's it's the first set's going to be me and great. Yes, yeah. Every time I say Graham's name, Matt coughs. Yeah, you can't help it. He's allergic to Graham Dexter. Um, I'm doing it with Graham Dexter, who's an amazing guitar player and Alex Frank, who's an amazing bass player who found Penn's bass for him, who's a great he runs. He plays the bass in Jeff Goldblum's band, which is all hot L.A. studio players and Jeff Goldblum, but. It's but it's it's really it's it's we're doing like in the 1940s and 50s, right after World War Two, the most popular jazz combo setup was piano, bass and guitar. And so Nat King Cole's trio was piano, bass, guitar. Oscar Peterson had a trio. Art Tatum had a trio. That was like the thing. And then sort of in the 50s, drums work their way in, you know, because they felt sorry for drummers couldn't get a gig. So they gave them gigs and that that format sort of went away. And nobody does it really anymore. And I got together with these guys sort of as a tribute to that kind of music. And we did a record in my living room a few years ago. And the record label said you guys should do a real live album because it's really good. And there there's so much fun to play with that I'm really looking forward to it. And then because of a lot of behind the scenes stuff, the gram at the last minute wasn't sure he could do it. So I hired a drummer and then when Graham said he could do it, I said to the label, hey, why don't we just do two albums? I'll do one with the trio with the drummer and one with the trio with Graham. And the label love the idea because Capri Records is not a mega mega corporation. So basically he's getting two records for the price of one. Right. And and it's just twice the work for me. So I was going to say, you volunteered to do all of the extra work and they didn't have to. I'm an idiot. Yeah, let's. That isn't clear to everyone listening now. I am an idiot and you know, not only are there to be killer bands that Jonesy has assembled here, but if you have not gone to VIX, it is a great Vegas. It's a nice room. It's really the sound too. I mean, besides the fact that the staff and the food is great and the staff is amazing and everybody wants to be polite and helpful. The room, I believe I may be talking out of my ass, which I have been since I got on the call, but I believe that the room was designed by the guy that did the Jazz at Lincoln Center room. They brought him in for the acoustics. And I'm telling you, you can play that place with no amplification. It's 88 seats. And is that a reference to the it is? It is one for every key on on the saxophone, right? I would have to be the person at that venue that is in charge of making sure they're always exactly 88 seats. I'm sorry, we can't let you both in. We can only let one of you in. We can let eight more people in and we'll call it a Bosendorfer because they have. Oh, but no, and it's but the room is great. The sound is great and they record really well. And I think it's going to be a really fun time or it's going to be something that people want to witness for other reasons. You know, I'll be having a meltdown on stage doing the 14th of a song. None of it's right. None of it's right. You know, no, no, because I'm going to warn everyone, you know, they know we're putting all the social media is saying live album recording. So and I was on I was on Sunday School and I said to Penn, Penn said, oh, so you can tell them if they heckle, it'll come on to the record. And, you know, I said, oh, that's great, you know, I and the hecklers will get are like, wait a minute, that's the Mixolydian mode. Did you just play a flat five on that chord? What's wrong with you? Yeah, jazz, jazz, hecklers are the worst. Yeah, yeah. Wait, did was was that a Bill Evans quote you just played? Come on. But but anyhow, it'll be no, it'll be a lot of fun. And and I'm really I've been trying to get this done for two years. And I think that, you know, I so I in preparation, I had my head cut open. So, um, yeah, yeah. Because, you know, I said to Jen, I hope your Photoshop skills are good enough. You're not going to wear a fancy hat. Well, here's the problem. I probably will wear a fancy hat, but I tried to wear a fancy hat in the show last night. We were back at the Rio and I wore on one of the hat from blue kazoo bit, which is a fancy hat. I mean, those hats like or expensive. And I had a lot of Kazoo is outrageous. Well, the budget was through the roof. I mean, but I look horrible in hats. I just don't have a head for hats and but I put it on and Penn says to me, it looks like it's going to fall off your head. Pull it down. It's supposed to be, you know, and so I put it down because, yeah, that's a lot better. So I wore it for the whole pre-show, right? And I come back to my dressing room and from here to here is bright purple. All of the front of your head. You're holding your whole forehead. Yeah. And I'm like, oh my God, I screwed up everything. It cut off the blood flow. What's going to happen? I go to go to the emergency room because I don't worry about anything. And and it's like there was like a ridge and it had just like cut the because I guess because it's just all sensitive from the surgery. And they pull all your skin together so it gets super tight. Oh, yeah. So for three nights, I couldn't sleep because if I did this, it hurt up here. Ah, you know, and touch your chin and the top of your head would start hurting. Yeah. Really? Seriously. I was trying to shave yesterday. I'm like, oh, um, but so anyways, but luckily it's gone away now. And I think I'll be okay. But that goes that idea for that hat. In the chat is suggesting maybe you could use one of our fezzes. We do have patented, well, I thought about that. I also thought about, um, uh, you know, like, um, just like, uh, a Nick cap, like I'm going on a killing spree. Um, I'm like a dainty bonnet or something like that. Have you thought that would be recommended to do rag? A full ball of club. It would be kind of wild. You know, um, just look at the chat. It says a chef's hat, a chef's hat would be great. Yeah. Well, the problem is, and I mean, I know we're all just joking, but the problem is they all have a thing that will cut off the circulation. Not this. This, this is not. Is it? No, no, no, no, no. I figured it out. Bucket of chicken, bucket of chicken. Right over the, yeah, yeah. Bucket head, jazz bucket head. I tribute the bucket head. Oh, you know, that'd be awesome. Won't touch the head at all. No lamp lampshade would also work. Yeah, lampshade. Yeah. You could do, you could do a popcorn bucket and cut a hole at the top and be like, I'm wearing this completely wrong. Right. I'm bad at this, but I need one of those things that they, you know, they screw on your head for brain surgery, you know, a halo, a halo, and they just drape something over it. Now you're thinking, I know this is the kind of thoughts that get you, get you a real, real career. But anyhow, no, it'll, it'll all be fine. But, but it's healing up well and hopefully by the time I play the Green Mill next week, I won't have to have a bandage or hat. Well, I'll need a hat for Chicago, but, but it's, yeah, but it's, it's, it's the, the, the Monday night thing is going to be something that I've been looking forward to for a few years. But also, yeah, there's a little bit of pressure on me, but it's, I think that the joy will outweigh the pressure. You want the pressure, you need the pressure, you need it. Yeah, yeah, it's a pressure cooker. No pressure, no diamonds. I perform best when under pressure. No, I think that the fun will weigh out. Beautiful jazz is best under pressure. Damn right. Well, all of the stuff that I'm doing for this, like producing it, and Jen, of course, is like making all this shit happen too. This is not the way I make records. Usually the company says, we got a recording date and who do you want on it? And I go into the studio and I make it. But this record and the record before this, I'm doing all the work because the label is in Colorado and he can't leave to come to Vegas. And the last record was with Penn and Jeff Hamilton. So I have to make sure that Jeff Hamilton is happy and I have to book the studio and I have to do, you know, and all this stuff, I'm incompetent. I don't, I can barely fucking feed myself. You know, so I, you know, it's all of that on top of trying to play good songs for people and not, you know, make a fool of myself as a musician. You know, it's just a lot of different pressure. But, but it's, but it's fine. I mean, we get, we'll get there. It'll be fun. And, and they wisely give us a meal. So I know that I'm really just working for food at the end of the, you know, when the recording's done, I get fed. It doesn't matter what level of fame or fortune the musician is at. If you give them food, they're going to be thrilled. Right. Absolutely. I mean, I, you know, and I mean, I, you know, I say that by you go to, you go to craft services, you after, after the, after the, uh, after the sound check and, you know, my bosses are down there. They're eating, you know, because, you know, that's what you do. I mean, it's, it's, it's the risk. It's the reward for a, you know, a lifetime spent banging on a piano. You get a free meal once in a while. If you ever want to just like please an artist, just feed them. If you just feed the artist, they will be, they will be so happy. I know I am. I forgot, Mike, that your, uh, that your camera follows you around with the, uh, with the AI thing. So when you just leaned over to get a drink out of your cup, I was really wondering why you were moving the camera to follow yourself to get that drink. I see, I see. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, man, he is really into this camera thing. Damn right. I, um, but, uh, no, it's, you know, it's, it's funny when I was doing gigs in, in, in, in Boston, when I got out of college and, uh, I did the whole circuit. Like there were 40 or 50 places in Boston that had live music every night from like five o'clock at night till nine. There was a shift and then nine to one. And I played a lot of cocktail shifts and a lot of night shifts and all of these places, their reputation among musicians was who had the best employee cafeteria. Yep. You know, uh, that's all we cared about. It's like, oh man, I got a gig next Friday night at the Ritz, you know, and you would go up to the top floor on the Ritz and the food up there was better than most restaurants for the employees, you know, and if you didn't like what they were offering, they would make you a burger, which at the time a Ritz burger was like $20, you know, and they would just make it for you and you would go up there and they would have like a prime rib hash that was out for the, for the, for the, in the street bar that, you know, I mean, this stuff was, I still think about that, you know, we're talking about it. Well, it's so funny and I'm going off, I'm taking up your whole show. Well, what the hell, why not? You were stupid enough to have me. I would, I would see these old musicians, like guys that I worshiped when I was in Boston and I got lucky enough to be friends with and play with and I'd be on this gig after seeing Dave McKenna, who was a great jazz pianist, and I would be in a room with Dave McKenna and Dick Johnson, who was a great clarinetist who led the Artie Shaw band and he's, these guys are legendary musicians and Herb Pomeray and Dick Johnson and Gray Sargent and all the guys from, from Boston and they all played, I mean, Herb Pomeray played with Charlie Parker, you know, that's the level of these musicians and I'm sitting there as a 22 year old guy wanting to suck up all the all the stories and all the energy and you know what they talked about? Oh, remember that diner on Route 9? The fucking mashed potatoes there were unbelievable, you know, and Dave McKenna's like, oh, this white pizza at this place in Hartford, I'd do the gig just for that. That's what they're talking about, you know, I played with Ella Fitzgerald for six nights and, you know, they don't care, they're like, that's food, food, food is important, that's what I've learned in life. Jonesy, when do you think the albums are going to come out? What? When do you think the albums are going to drop? Oh, the albums? Oh, not until, I mean, with Locke, you know, Spring or Summer of 26. Okay. I mean, I'm going to push them a little bit more, you know, maybe even as soon as March or April for one of them. I don't know if they'll do two of them at the same time. I don't know, you know, as I said, in dealing with all of the machinations to make these records, Johnny Katz asked me what the title was going to be, and I said, we don't have them titled yet, which we don't. But as I said to Jen, the title of the first one is going to be Never Again. And the title of the second one is Somebody Kill Me. This was your chance to see me do this. I'm not doing it again. Yes, exactly. Title. Exactly. No, no, I mean, I will come up with something, you know, a little bit, a little bit better than Vampin' at Vix. Not much better. Not much better. Go on and see Jonesy tonight at Vix, subscribe to the stereo image. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Jonesy, for coming on and chatting with us. God bless you, Matt and Jacob and Paul and all of the scoops out there. And yes, do do whatever you want. Come on out and subscribe if you want to hear me talk more about music with people that are smarter than me. There you go. All right. Thanks, guys. Really, really appreciate it. Thanks, Jonesy. Bye, bye. So shy. Yeah, yeah. It's tough to get him out of his shell. One day, one day, though, he's going to really start talking. Retiring Violet that Jonesy. Yeah. He's a fascinating dude. He is absolutely. And that podcast is great. I've listened to a couple episodes. Yes. He gets deep with some of his guests. Yeah, yeah. Well, they're talking about like a personal relationship with music, which is always, it's always going to be fascinating. And then you add knowledge into it on top of it. And it's, it's a, it's a really, it's a really great thing. Coming from a very educated place. Yeah. Well, I had a Scoopity hero picked out because Jonesy was with us. He's gone now. We're going to play it anyway. Here comes a Scoopity. Ladies and gentlemen, it is. We got a Scoopity coming to us today from the OG Scoop. The categories are rock with strings, bond theme artists from Broadway to pop and old ass songs. That's right. It's a music Scoopity. Oh, I'm first. Well, I'll start top left corner. Rock with strings for 200. Kansas basically says we are all dirt in this 70s classic. It's the shit. The name of the song. Dust of the Wind. Horse with no name. Horse with no name. Dust of the Wind is it. Matt, you're up. I'll do rock with strings for 400. Let's see here. This moody blues song speaks of written letters that were never meant to be sent. Knights and white satin. I think so. All right. That's a white satin. Knights and white satin. Letters I've written never meant to be sent. I'll do rock with strings for 800. Let's go. Whoa, skip it over. This Zeppelin song name drops a region of the Indian subcontinent. Yeah, you're glad you skipped over the $800 question now, aren't you? Cashmere, I think. Let's try it. It's cashmere. Damn it. See, I always thought it was referring to Ed Wood's sweaters, but I guess I was wrong. You thought Zeppelin made it. He played all the coffee houses when I was coming up. As the 90s, there's a lot of coffee houses. Scott Hathaway would mic his guitar super all over the place, and he would play cashmere by wearing a jangly bracelet, hitting certain guitar strings, and playing the drums on the bottom of the guitar. It was insane. Yeah, yeah. It was a little... I've seen people do that. It's a little one-man bandy. Yeah, and my son, my youngest son brought up a clip of someone doing that who was younger and doing it, and I, as proud dad moment, bit my tongue and didn't say, I know someone who did that when I was young also. I just let him appreciate the new young guy doing it for the first time. Smart, smart. You know, for the first time. Smart. And I was like, yep. That's awesome. Way to find that. Way to discover that. Way to discover this brand new thing. No one has done before. Yeah. I'll say it's me. I'll try an old-ass song. It's 200. This Queen song is almost always played with their song Bicycle Race. Which one do they play with Bicycle Race? I'm going to feel really dumb here in a second. I'm going to pass. Matt. I think it's Fat Bottom Girls. Is it? All right, let's try it. It is Fat Bottom Girls. Look at that. Yeah. Matt. Miss, I always play them together. Smart. I will do... Let's go from Broadway to pop. Daily Double! Yvonne Ellman had this hit from Jesus Christ Superstar. Go get Jesus and hang him on the cross. What's the hit from Jesus Christ Superstar? Oh, there's a random. I need this problem like I need a hole in my hand. So I can't get the fuck down. Someone needs the wood. I'm going to shroud up Turin all over your face. Man, it's a Daily Double, so I have to guess. It is. Let's see. Jesus Christ Superstar. It's got all the Judas songs. Creepers, creepers. Where'd you get those peepers? Sure, yeah. Creepers, creepers. Where'd you get those eyes? Rubba dub dub. I was washing my feet in the tub. Yep. One, two, three, four. It's Jesus. Five, six, seven. Eight o'clock. It's Jesus. I'll just say Jesus Christ Superstar is the hit. There you go. Let's try it. I don't know how to love him. I don't know how to... I'll also let's play the game. I don't know how to love him. It's also what the answer to this. Paul, you're up. I will also try from Broadway to pop. Let's try it. This Wicked song was inescapable in the early 2000s. It gotta be. I believe it's Let It Go. No, it got me defying gravity. No, I'm sorry, Paul. It was Letting Go. Letting Go from Wicked. I have green skin. Please don't eat the green snow. I'll try. Let's see. Broadway to pop, 600. Oh, shit. I did the wrong thing. I did old-ass songs. According to Trace Atkins, the subject of this song has got it going on like Donkey Kong. Oh, you know, for a second, I thought I wasn't going to know the answer to the question that I accidentally clicked on for myself. Now you do that. Fortunately, fortunately, it's the song that is my wake-up tone. It plays on my alarm every morning. I listen to it before I go to bed at night. It is, of course, honky-tonk, but donk-a-donk. Correct. Yes. Matt, you're up. By the way, that was from old-ass songs, not from Broadway to pop. Oh, good. I would hope. Rock with strings for 600, please. ELO added strings to this amazing cover of a Chuck Berry tune. I don't know. Pass. Paul. Well, goodness. I think this is also let it go. It could be my dingaling. It's the string version of my dingaling. Well, Silver Bell's hanging out his string. I'll pass. Oh, that passes to me. I don't know. I'll pass. Roll over Beethoven. Roll over Beethoven. I've never heard the ELO version of that. I don't think I have either. Paul, you're up. Tchaikovsky, the news. Broadway to pop, please. A first-sex hundo. Susan Boyle's shocked judges on Britain's Got Talent with this song from Lemis Robles. Uh. Lemis Robles. Lemis Robles. Me if you don't believe. It was, uh, I don't know how to love it. It was a castle on a cloud. Yeah, right. That's my favorite, but I ain't doing that anymore. This is the song that I sang. Oh, is it? No, it's not. Keeper of the Zoo. Not where is love. Uh, what's love got to do? Oliver. Got to do with it. Where is love is from Oliver? Uh, shit. What is this one? Please, sir, can I ask some more? I have to pass. I don't know. Uh, it passes to me. What is it? What did she sing from Britain? Yeah, I don't remember. Well, that's the whole question, isn't it? Um, the master of the house. This is not the song that she would have sung on the talent show. It's not the I'm John Valjean song. It's probably not on John Valjean. No, it's probably not. Yeah, it's probably not. Oh, my. I'm Susan Boyle. Oh, that'd be great. That is so great. Um, it fits the meter. Empty chairs at empty tables. That doesn't feel right. Oh, my God, dude. Have you heard the empty chairs at empty tables? Muppets mash up. No, no, Christ. The Muppets did they miss it? No, it just fits to. It fits perfectly with the Muppet show intro. And it's just as haunting and tragic. That's great. All right, I have to look for it or send it to me. I will. Why am I looking for it? You send it to me. Um, I don't, I got to pass. Matt. It's a dream of dream. Oh, it's the only song I couldn't think of from lay this. Yeah, I couldn't remember it myself. Matt just knew it. Yeah. Uh, it's me. I'll try. I'll close up. Pop Broadway 800 or Broadway to pop. You know what I mean? Abba songwriters, Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ylvisis, along with Tim Rice, pinned this tune from chess. I had no idea that anybody from Abba worked on chess, so I'm going to pass. Matt. Shoot, my wife loves chess. Everyone loves the soundtrack to chess and no one loves the show. That's exactly right. Um, I mean, this is the one hit. I got it. You got it. It's a one night in Bangkok. That's what you're going with? Yeah. It's one night in Bangkok. Yeah. That's just right. It's the only song there is in chess to have made of hit. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know any songs to chess. It's a man playing chess. I don't know. You're right. I don't know why. I need more credit. More credit. Paul's right. Paul's right, everyone. One night in Bangkok and your cock gets banged on. Um, Matt, you got Bond theme artists or old ass songs. What you want? Hand me that hammer gun. I'm going to bang some cock. For one night. Bangkok, Oriental city where you have to bring your hammer because hammers ain't cheap. How about an old ass song? Bring your hammer and disinfect it because you're going to be banging on your cock all night. Casey and the Sunshine Band got scores of us to do this in the 70s. Have unprotected sex. Oh, Casey and the Sunshine Band. There's several possible answers here. There's several possible answers here. I think it's good. Two little dance and make a little love get down tonight or let's try it. Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. Oh shoot. It's going to be that. It's going to be that. What is it, Matt? What's your final answer? You got to pick one. Your answer fits better to a question than mine does. I think that's why I went there is shake your booty. You see you're going to shake your booty? Yeah, shake your booty. Let's try it. It is shake, shake, shake, shake your booty. There we go. Way to go, Matt. You and your booty. Get that right. Paul. Phew. Bond theme artist. What the hell? Let's see. A singer of nobody does it better from the spy who loved me. I think that's Eartha Kitt. Let's try it. Eartha Kitt. Carly Simon. Shit on me. The Eartha Kitt of James Bond music. The Carly Simon of Eartha Kitt. It's me. I'll close out old ass songs for 400. Sir Mixolot's favorite body part of the opposite sex is obvious from this song. I believe it's my humps, my hulumps, my lovely lady lumps. My Sir Mixolot. That would be the butt song. Baby got back. Yeah, there it is. Matt, you got Bond theme artist for four, six, or eight. I had to really shuffle through all of the Sir Mixolot hits in my brain to get to that one. I'll go. Did Mixolot do one of the Bond things? He did. Under a suit in him though. Oh yeah, score check. Paul has 1800. Matt has 1400. I have 1200. I think there's a daily double left as well in one of these three questions. I like James Bond and I cannot lie. You other spies can't deny. When a guy rolls in with a car with tricks and shoots somebody from the roof. It's James Bond's car. Um, all right, this is Bond theme artist for 400. Let's see it. Not Guns and Roses, but this group recorded the soundtrack theme from Live and Let Die First. That'd be Big Buckethead. Big Buckethead, of course. What was the name of that group? Paul McCartney, but do I have to? But it was a group? Yeah, it's a band. Oh, Wings. Wings, there you go. Paul McCartney and Wings. Paul, you got theme artists for six or 800. You're currently tied with Matt at 1800. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I'll go 800. 800. Let's go. Let's go. 800. Yeah. It's the Daily Double. I knew it. I knew it. Now it's for 1800. But I had to do this. You had to. I did. In my opinion, this Goldfinger theme singer started the tradition of epic Bond songs. If that's your opinion, OG Scoop, you're correct. I think this is Eartha Kitt. Oh, it is not. Oh, fuck me. It is Shirley Bassey. My ass. Shirley Bassey. My ass. Oh, I clicked the wrong thing. I clicked it. Paul got it right, which he definitely did not. Bond theme artists for 600. That's what I'm closing it out with. This R&B Diva legend graced us all with the theme from license to kill. This was, of course, Eartha Kitt. It's not. It's Gladys Knight. That's the game. Did Eartha Kitt do a Bond song? I don't think so. No. That's the game. Matt wins with 1,800 points. I'm in second with 600 points. Paul is in third with zero points. Not according to the scoreboard, though. According to the scoreboard, Paul crushed us with 3,600 points. And that's from OG Scoop. Thank you, OG Scoop. Because everyone knows Shirley Bassey was literally just Eartha Kitt. She was. So there you go. It was three Shirley Bassey's in a trench coat dressed up as Eartha Kitt. So do we have time for me to share my winter stories for you? Well, tell us, Paul. Tell us. Oh, let me tell you people this. If you want to send us a Scoopity, a Price of Scrape, Jock vs. Nerd, any kind of Jock vs. Nerd, or an email, heyscoops.com. That's where you can go. Send us all those things right over there at heyscoops.com. Paul, do you have a Tale of Winter? I have a couple. So it's colder in witches' tit in a brass bra out here. It's freezing. And we got our first significant snow the other day. And it happened between my improv classes. So one improv class I went to on Monday, no problem. Tuesday, a little more treacherous. The roads are pretty fine because out here they know how to deal with snow. They plow and they salt, and it's all good. So the roads are not a problem. They plow, they salt, they plow, they salt, plow and salt, salt and plow. You may remember. Just fine, it's fine, it's fine. You may remember outside of the Skit Theatre area, there is a large section of stairs. Do you recall these stairs? Oh yes, right. Okay. Well, I came upon those stairs on my second night, not thinking anything of it really. They looked trot upon, but they didn't look like they weren't snowy. So I thought, okay, we're fine. Well, it had gotten to about 35 degrees that day. Okay. Then by the time I got to the stairs, it was back down to about 30. And so the stairs were basically covered in black ice. I took my first step onto that stairs. My feet went out from under me. I was lucky to have hold of the handrail. I swampled, I didn't fall, I swampled down to my ass onto these frozen stairs. And I could not get my feet under me for the life of me. Oh no. So I scooted on my ass down 15 stairs all the way down on ice. And my butt was just soaking wet for the rest of class. It was disgusting. And in my terror of my near-death experience, I quickly texted Justin. I'm like, oh my God, I almost died on the stairs. You have to tell everybody. Send emails out. Someone could really get hurt. I must have freaked him out. I was in such a tizzy. I was in such a tizzy. You do get in tizzies. It's bad. Then last night, it's getting down to 11. And Anne suddenly remembers, oh, shit. We don't have the external hose hookup covered for the winter. And we didn't turn the water off. That could lead to frozen pipes. That's not a good thing. So she turns. So she remembers this last night at 9 o'clock PM, when I've been asleep for almost an hour and a half. And so she wakes me up from a dead sleep to tell me, oh, God, we've got to get this thing fixed. Where is this? She's got like a glove for the pipe. She's like, where's the glove? I don't know. I have no idea where the glove is. It got removed in the spring when she started doing watering stuff and it hasn't been replaced. And I don't know where the fuck it is. But I managed to go get some pool noodle because I have spare pool noodle around for such an emergency, cut up some pool noodle, fashioned a crude glove, if you will, for the external piece. And we duct taped it up and there you go. All fixed. Then I turn around and she is back in bed. Meanwhile, I'm up. And I was beside myself that she had been able to go right back to bed after that so quickly and left me to fiddle with the dogs. It was really funny to me. But then this morning I get the call that she got her karmic comeuppance for waking me in the night. Oh, good. It's about time she learns a lesson. No, this is tragedy. This is tragedy. She she's drinking her coffee this morning that she's made out of her little machine and the coffee is off. Right. It's off. Something's something's really off about the coffee and she doesn't know what, but she knows it's off and she goes to open up the coffee machine and there is a stink bug in the coffee machine and she is beside herself. She cannot handle this revelation. This is like, this is the thing that puts her over the edge. She gets violently ill from the stink bug in the coffee machine. She's throwing up everywhere. She's because she's drank stink bug juice. So she's just like, dear God. So she's done not only that, not only that, she is so upset that I had to buy her a new coffee maker today. She will not use the stink bug. What? Fakes in coffee maker. I said, there's nothing wrong with this coffee maker. She's like, I can't even look at it. I can't, I couldn't even be in the kitchen without getting violently ill. I'm like, okay. So if there's one Achilles heel on Old McFeeders, it's stink bugs and liquids. It's stink bugs. There you go. You got to get a new coffee maker and put a fake stink bug in there just to start it off right. Lauren Shreve says, if you've smelled stink bug, you'll understand. And it's true. They are foul, foul things. We didn't have any, we don't have any in Vegas. Thank God. They are nasty, nasty critters. They're really, really gross. So anyway, she's got a nice new coffee machine now. And hopefully that will be all good. We got the small brown ones. You just get all these, just a bunch of plastic bugs to just fill the coffee maker with it. Oh, no, no, don't. Oh, she'll be so sad. Don't send fake plastic bugs. Honestly, she wouldn't care. A fake plastic bug wouldn't affect the taste of her coffee. It's the fact that this bug actually put all kind of goo in her coffee and she drank it. It was nasty. Oh, that pervy bug. What would disinfect it is if you peed all over the old coffee maker and that would be, that would help. I told her we could do that. Well, no, no, that's, that's if a jellyfish gets into your coffee maker. It's just as well. Oh, that's it. It's an older model. It still works great. I'm going to give it to the Goodwill. Her name is Ann. Don't call her an older model. But the other day when she was really, really sick, I guess it was Thanksgiving day when she was really, really sick. She was making coffee for herself and she forgot to put a cup in the machine. And I came in and I'm like, Ann, what the fuck? She was just spilling coffee all over the machine. And the thing is your coffee maker does that. Then you do need to get a new coffee maker. Your coffee maker is out of date. Yeah. So she was like, I don't even know what I'm doing. But it got coffee all in the base of the machine. So it can go now. It's, it's, it served its time. It's time. Poor thing was, poor thing was just out of it. Well, I for one, I'm certainly glad that Ann finally got her comeuppance for waking you up earlier than you wanted to wake up. Yeah. She got her come up and serves her right in the, in the form of a brand new coffee maker. No, it's all good. She's dead right. And I would be the most upset if we had any kind of water damage happen, because that's coming right down here to the old back cave. You know, it's not going anywhere but down. And these, these, I've got plenty of stuff that won't be too terribly affected because most of it's all plastic, but there's plenty of paper down here to get fucked. I gotta, I gotta believe Paul, even if you weren't there, I think if the basement started flooding, I think the squirrel would get most of the stuff out of the basement. I think the squirrel would save most of the possessions down there. Think they're, they're that sensible to get everything out? Maybe. I do. I think, I think this, I think the squirrels have taken full ownership of the basement and everything in it. They want to take care of it. All right. They don't have an insurance policy. One night at Paul's house and the world's my oyster. I creep and crawl in whenever I want to. Sarah Boyle? No, that's the scoop. Susan Boyle, that's the name. Shit. Susan Boyle. One night at Susan Boyle. I want to thank Mike Jones for coming on the program. Absolutely. I'm going to tell them to subscribe to his podcast. Go get his live out. And it's going to vex if you're around Vegas Monday night. I also want to thank all the scoops who joined us here on, on Twitch. Yes. I want to thank all the scoops who joined us here on Zoom. That's right. And it's normal we thank people in the show. It's a new month. We haven't got to thank you this coordinated yet, but I want to thank, of course, everyone who supports us over on our Patreon. All the people who find it in their hearts and in their wallets to go over to preachingfun.com. I'm really looking forward to the day that I don't have to play that whole theme manually. I'm actually, I've gotten it all inked out on a piece of paper and I'm going to have somebody cut out all the little holes in it for a player piano. But in the meantime, check out fartsinabag.biz. That's fartsinabag.biz that along with preachingfun.com it takes you over to our Patreon page where for as little as three dollars a month you can upkeep this show on the air. We are dependent on our Patreon subscribers. So if you are not a Patreon subscriber preachingfun.com fartsinabag.biz head over there. If you think this show is worth more than zero dollars you can upkeep this show on the air and we sure do thank you for it. If you can't do it, if you can't go over and do the monetary value thing, that is okay. Not everybody is able to do that these days. Tell somebody about us. Tell one person, one person only. Don't do the two friends and then they tell two friends things. That is a pyramid scheme. It is unethical. We don't get into that. We do an obelisk scheme. You tell one person, one person only. It's vertical growth but you're going to find that one person that really kind of digs this weird thing that we're doing over here. So go let them know about us. Let them know about the obelisk scheme. One person and one person only but that person has to dig this thing and probably preferably get on there and support the Patreon within the first, I don't know 10 minutes or so if you're telling them about us. That'd be really convenient for us. Don't forget about our billionaire experiment. Don't forget, get each of us a billion dollars and we will see if we can be better billionaires than the current ones. Oh, shout out to Radio Active Scoop for doubling their Patreon. Thank you.
