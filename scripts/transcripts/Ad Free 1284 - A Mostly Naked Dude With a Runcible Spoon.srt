00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,260
 Masters of the universe movie trailer. That's right

12
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,480
 This episode is all about the new Masters of the universe

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:26,520
 We're preaching fun preaching. Yeah, we got are we twitched up. We're twitched up

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,500
 Matt is still freezing his took us off over there in Indiana is me too

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,120
 You're recording this on a Monday my feet are a little chilly. It's it's just shy of 70 here and

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,560
 I am a slightly uncomfortable. I have my house shoes on there. They're taking care of most of it though

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,000
 So don't worry about me. Did you get a snow measurement Matt?

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,840
 Is that this at 20 20 to 24 inches fell here? Oh my goodness. That's double what we got. That's crazy. Yeah and

19
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,360
 Because of that they don't serve breakfast anywhere

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,880
 Very long a long walk with Mike Mills and our tech guy scooter

21
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,560
 we were inept but it changed our opinion of where we were staying so

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,520
 We were finishing up our show. We just show let's say, Kentucky. They made two shows in Cincinnati and

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,320
 We're supposed to go at the Bloomington and do a show that was canceled and then we're heading to Chicago

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,760
 But it's another show being produced out here

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,520
 by

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
 Mike Mills and so

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,280
 We were going to come out here to see a preview of that show anyway

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,760
 I don't know if it's public yet, so I can't say which show it is

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,920
 It's a tradition that okay people may or may not have heard of but

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,880
 so we're deciding whether to snow ourselves into Cincinnati and

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,200
 Then just see if the roads are good to come out Monday to watch the show. Yeah, they go to Chicago after that or

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,160
 Snow ourselves in Indiana you're at and be right there and then just be here for three days and that'll be fun

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,580
 And so we we voted for going to Indiana

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,360
 So we finished our show and it was already snowing when we were packing up our van. Yeah, it was really exciting

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,920
 And then we did you have that like that that that feel of like we got to get the fuck out of here or we're not

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,360
 Gonna yes. Yeah. Yeah, and and so off we went

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,040
 I don't like that feel at all off we went hit the snowy roads driving at a brisk 40 miles an hour

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,440
 Good as we head out through the snow and we're in a big spreader van. It's nice and heavy

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,960
 So we're not worried about we were feeling good. We weren't slipping and sliding

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,680
 Last like hour of the trip. It was supposed to take like an hour 45 minutes took three hours three and a half hours. Yeah

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,840
 And we were following a snowplow which is one good because we're we're driving on a plowed street

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
 But plows go about

43
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,520
 15 to 20 miles an hour. Yeah, they're not they're not known for their quickness

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,440
 No, don't you do so we were just like it was a crawl

45
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,940
 To the to the place now

46
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,600
 we're staying at this spot called the Grant Street in here in Bloomington and

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,320
 We called ahead twice to be like we might come out late tonight. Is that okay?

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,080
 And then we're definitely coming out late tonight. Is that okay?

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,800
 And so we pull up and the Grand Street is actually like three houses converted into a hotel

50
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,120
 So okay you check in the main house, but then you get sent across the street to the other house

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,080
 So we pull up at about three o'clock in the morning

52
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:33,680
 Mike goes in and we hear nothing for like ten minutes. We're just taking three and a half hours here

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,160
 we're finally at the place we want to be and now we're just sitting in the car and then Mike says

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,480
 You guys might want to come in or whatever

55
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
 We couldn't find anyone

56
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,440
 At the hotel and then finally someone woke up and came our way and said oh gosh

57
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,480
 I don't even have the passwords for the computer. I don't think I can check you guys in

58
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,280
 York's

59
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
 Right

60
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 This is things like Mike Mills

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,440
 I've had him on an abracadabra. I should have him on here. It's very funny guy also

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,040
 Calm like a jacket again. Oh shoot. You're clipping on us

63
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,000
 Calm guy. Yeah

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Like and all this is what time though. This is what time in the lobby of the hotel 3 3 15 in the morning

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,440
 Yeah, and you've been and you've been driving behind the snowplow for how long about an hour and

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,640
 I asked him to chat earlier

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,040
 Who who drives who was driving?

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,880
 Initially, I was driving as I picked up the car in Cincinnati

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,840
 And I drove it to Lexington and I was trying to drive and Mike Mills does so much for the tour

70
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,920
 I produce it and also does all of the you know logistics and stuff

71
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,920
 So I thought I would drive but because it was snowing and he lives in New York and I live in, Nevada

72
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,200
 He thought he was maybe a little more qualified to drive in the snow than me

73
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,960
 He's at least a recent practice most likely. Did you tell him?

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,840
 Jersey born. Yeah. No, he's aware. He's aware

75
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,320
 Don't have an argument about it though. Yeah much like springsteen

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,920
 People know where I'm from

77
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,760
 They figure it out

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
 Yeah

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,120
 So we go

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,600
 So so your dreams so right where he's from like well, we got to stay here

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,040
 I guess like in the main building like at least you got to have at least in the lobby

82
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,040
 No, but like a key to open up some room somewhere like they have something right? Yeah. Yeah, that's right

83
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
 so

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,160
 She says yes, and so we start opening the van. It's still snowing right? This is this is the start

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
 This is the start of the god. Yeah

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,120
 so we're unloading all of our stuff and then one of the really funny things that happens that both Mike and I have

87
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
 tricks that involve

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,440
 Liquids cans of stuff. Oh

89
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,160
 Yeah, okay, we can't leave that in the van old. No, we bought we bought enough for the whole tour

90
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,460
 So we had to like haul every all of our liquid props

91
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,480
 flats of

92
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,960
 Cans of water in yes, so to unload everything and we get halfway through unloading our vans

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,940
 Oh, no, I figured it out. We can get you guys checked in across the street. No problem. Oh god damn it

94
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,760
 So then we pick up all of our stuff and load it back into the van I

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,100
 Again

96
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,640
 Mike

97
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,160
 Mike when he came out explained this he was like I can't fucking believe this right like he occurs

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
 He never curses he's I can't fucking believe he's he's shoveling snow off of the thing because he hasn't told us yet

99
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,140
 I've got to unload our van, but he's clearing the way as he's cursing to let it like he's clearing a path

100
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,560
 So I try to like do an end around and I grab the shovel and I run across the street to like pre I start shoveling

101
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,580
 The other house out so that we can load stuff into the place that we are staying gotcha. Okay, you're thinking ahead

102
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,920
 Yeah, the van

103
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,720
 Can't get out of the parking space that it's in because of the snow

104
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,200
 It's like we're doing the wibbly wobbly, you know rack rocket back and forth thing trying to get some grip

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,800
 You know, and we finally get loose it goes up. It's 330 in the morning

106
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,360
 We finally get loose and it's a we're on a one-way street and it's snow covered, right?

107
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
 So it's definitely one way street one lane one way down

108
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,720
 And we get to the middle and we're about to unload our stuff and just another car just pulls up behind us

109
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 Oh shit

110
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,320
 It's four in the morning, yeah

111
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,880
 Mike drives around the block, right? It takes like five minutes like that. I

112
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,120
 And I'm like just shoveling away. I have no gloves. It's 15 degrees and

113
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,920
 I'm just shoveling away waiting for the van to return

114
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 Luckily you're only 19 years old

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,560
 Fiercely shoving away. It's still snowing like a mother and

116
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,600
 And then he pulls back around yeah, we open the door and another car pulls up

117
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:07,400
 Also this area really is a grid right like it's not complicated like you can go around us, right? Yeah and

118
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:14,080
 Then so Mike pulls up and he actually pulls up just so we can get the car out of the way that reverses back

119
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,760
 Yeah, do it and we unload half of our van

120
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,400
 into the through the through the through the path I've shoveled into the into the house that we're staying at and

121
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,840
 Halfway through a car. I can see it coming from blocks away. Our hazards are on is a giant Sprinter van

122
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,480
 The doors are open. We are moving in a chain of four people unloading. There's clearly something happening this thing happening and

123
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,920
 A car it just eases right up behind us and stop

124
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,840
 And I just said we're finishing the unloading and I yell at the team and I shot the dirtiest look to the person

125
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:07,280
 You can literally right now reverse 50 feet. Yeah and drive left and just go a different way. Yeah

126
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,880
 So they waited better than where I was afraid the story was going. I was afraid the story was going like I saw the headlights

127
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,540
 He was coming ran right into the van. Oh my god. Yeah

128
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,160
 But so yeah, so we loaded in

129
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,360
 Scoop says good thing know there when they change in your pocket

130
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,400
 Right, right. Right. So anyways didn't have the password text to the wrong place

131
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,000
 like we were pretty kind of a we were making fun of this hotel for a

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,160
 Minute, you know, right come with it. So

133
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,480
 Look at us. We're still doing it got the two mornings later

134
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,040
 We said we're gonna try to get breakfast now, you know, famously

135
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,080
 There's a restaurant here called the runsable spoon, which I have loved visiting here

136
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,680
 I've talked about the runsable spoon runsable spoon is what it's called. What's that mean? Who knows?

137
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,000
 What's the word runsable the runsable is the word?

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,960
 What's that mean and we looked it up before but it was unmemorable because we've had this conversation before but

139
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,440
 I cuz I came here when I came I played

140
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 When I played Washington, Indiana

141
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,440
 Aces bar grill. Uh-huh. I know that we've had this conversation before because there was it was

142
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,200
 Google remembered it. Yeah, I cuz I call I call me Jacob

143
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,520
 It's a nonsense word invented by Edward Lear

144
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:36,200
 Most famously from owl and the pussy cat. Okay, great. Yes. He will never remember that again. No, we won't forget next time

145
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,240
 But it's a it's a nonsense word. Oh, it's like a Jellico cats

146
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,120
 Yeah. All right. Great, but even dumber and I came here

147
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,260
 I said I said it was like it was like it was like all the waitress were like different Manson girls

148
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,080
 Like that's what it was like college. Oh, yeah. Yeah, whatever and it's

149
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,400
 Walls I remember that part. Yeah, exactly. Well, that's what we all remember. That's why we all want to go back

150
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,680
 right

151
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,640
 So runsable spoons still not open for the blizzard didn't recover it 24 hours

152
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,120
 No dice. Oh man, we walk out and about

153
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,080
 To all of all of Bloomington and all these restaurants are still closed this morning. Yeah

154
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,280
 we came back into the the host house of our three house hotel to get coffee and

155
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,560
 Very kind host who wasn't the guy who was up at 330 mornings. Like you guys do it. All right, you know

156
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,640
 We're like, ah, well, we just try to take a walk and we didn't make breakfast here this morning because we thought we're gonna walk

157
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,920
 Somewhere else for breakfast, but every place is closed or whatever. He goes

158
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,840
 Oh, oh, well, let me see if I can get some at least get some like fruit stuff together for you guys

159
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
 Some vittles rustled up. Oh

160
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,340
 And he goes downstairs and he comes up because you know, the cook hasn't left and we still have eggs and bacon

161
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,560
 You guys want us to make you up some eggs and bacon?

162
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,440
 Yes, yeah, they went out of their way and gave three of us like an amazing

163
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,240
 Immaculate breakfast. Wow, and I was like we and I just turned to Mike. I was like we are eating our fucking words

164
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,240
 We've been trashing this place for 24 hours and they totally outclassed us

165
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,420
 They turn today and they were just everywhere. There was an

166
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:21,200
 Incredibly nice it went above and beyond and so I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Grand Street in

167
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,480
 Right except that maybe they should have that past check-in process is a little

168
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,780
 Taped to put a post it know with a password somewhere that everyone knows, you know, so

169
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,760
 Password password who cares?

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,640
 We were just pissed about driving, you know

171
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:45,480
 42 to 15 miles an hour for three and a half hours, but you had also called ahead and now giving them the heads up

172
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,600
 That's it. That's a lot of you gave them the heads up a couple of times

173
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:59,080
 That's something that is something I'll tell you who else is something these folks really are something and that's the following sponsor

174
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 Today's show is brought to you by

175
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
 Go go phone go

176
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:15,400
 Michael Jackson's my skulls Jack's son head exercises for dancers

177
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:22,400
 My skulls jackson head exercises for dancers

178
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:37,080
 Hey everybody, I just want everyone to know that I have opened a whole new store

179
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,280
 It's called Michael Jackson's my Jack's on skull

180
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,000
 exercises for dancers

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
 And many of you don't ascribe to phrenology, but that's ignorant. That's just ignorant

182
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,720
 Phrenology is key when it comes to dancing the way your heads aerodynamics work with the breeze

183
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,340
 That's if you'd be a better dancer that way

184
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,280
 Are you saying that you that you're a good dancer because of your head shape, that's exactly right

185
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,480
 Michael Jackson's head shape is perfect for being a good dancer. If you know anything about phrenology, then you'd understand

186
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,920
 But you don't know what no phrenology is the study of the shape of the head and the discovery of

187
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,800
 Attributes and traits has been disproven time and again by science but embraced by horrible racists

188
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,400
 for generations

189
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,520
 So, why are we talking about it because that's the only way I can open my school you ignorant you ignorant

190
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,920
 I had to open my school based on phrenology because I'm not a medical doctor

191
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,600
 The only doctor I know gives me mama's meal. Give me milk. Give me some milk. I need to sleep. Give me more milk

192
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,640
 Check out

193
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 I

194
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,080
 Will speak

195
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,640
 It happened ladies and gentlemen

196
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:19,280
 There is a new Masters of the Universe movie coming to theaters this year June 5th

197
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,600
 Yes

198
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,980
 Are you excited about this? Paul? I'm very excited about this. Okay

199
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,200
 Are you excited about how excited Paul is about this? I know you excited for the inevitable crash. I watch

200
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 Oh, yeah, he's gonna hate the movie

201
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,320
 I don't know. I don't think I am

202
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,680
 So they've been trying to make different master the universe projects for a while and this one finally came to fruition

203
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,160
 Do you know behind that? Well, I mean the other ones have been put on the back burner for several different reasons

204
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,120
 probably because they were shit and

205
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,120
 Mattel didn't want their brand damaged. But here's why I'm hopeful

206
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,000
 the Barbie movie the Barbie movie made a fuck ton of money and was also critically lauded so

207
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,800
 That combo put into Mattel's mind

208
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:20,760
 Hey, if we put some autours and some actual directors in charge of this stuff and maybe hire some actors

209
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,520
 That actually know how to perform

210
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,520
 We can put a little gravitas or stuff. Yeah

211
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,400
 well, but they got a lot of other really great people in this movie to a lot of really great people in this movie, uh-huh, so I

212
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,560
 Think they've learned their lesson with Barbie that this can be another

213
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,680
 real bankroll move and

214
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:52,120
 Possible, you know legacy protector if they do it, right? And so I don't think they're fucking around. I

215
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,400
 Know support. What are your thoughts on the trailer? I

216
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,720
 It looks great

217
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,400
 You just think you're just generally excited about it. There wasn't there wasn't a single part of that you really stood out to you

218
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,160
 Nothing. I mean it all looks so like okay. So here's the thing

219
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,760
 I already talked to the scoops about this in the chat before but I'll talk about so

220
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,800
 You've got Marlena Glenn who was an astro a human astronaut from Earth. That is Queen Marlena

221
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,520
 Adam's mother right and the trailer focuses on her talking to him as a child

222
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,420
 Sending him away to earth for protection

223
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,920
 because

224
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,480
 likely because

225
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,000
 Adora had been captured and war was continued. That's all that's all real story. Yes. That's all that's all lore

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,140
 What's the word cannon? This is cannon? Yeah, this is legit. This is why I'm excited is because the real ones know

227
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,960
 No, I assumed watching this trailer that this was

228
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,640
 Made up something like this this whole premise of like sitting to earth and then and then no protecting all this stuff

229
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,760
 Now that never happened that never happened

230
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,680
 however

231
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,080
 Adora did get stolen away by Hordak and it would make sense for Marlena to want to protect

232
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,200
 Adam as the last heir to the attorney. It's really hard to take you seriously with their names like Hordak involved

233
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,080
 Tell you how it went down Hordak stole baby Adora. It's pronounced sex worker Dak now

234
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,060
 Pimp deck for those who know he keeps that pimp deck hand strong. I

235
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:31,280
 Mean Hordak's not even in the movie is he's even he's even higher up than Skeletor

236
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,280
 He's the one that trained Skeletor. So, you know, this is gonna be they're leading

237
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
 It's gonna it's gonna end up leading to like sequels, which is gonna be really cool. But no, this is legit

238
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,600
 Marlena is from earth. Uh-huh. He man is half earthling half Eternian. That's part of the lore

239
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,440
 That's part of why he is magically imbued. That's part of why he is this

240
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,900
 You know character that transcends world or just fuckable Mormon. I

241
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:02,900
 Mean now the blonde hair and all that that's an unfortunate side effect from hey, we have to make this unique IP

242
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:10,440
 Conan doesn't have blonde hair. Let's do that because another the origins of the Masters of the Universe toy line are

243
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,200
 Steeped in a lot of weird shit, but not least of which

244
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,880
 Mattel was in talks with the Conan movie guys to possibly do a movie line, right?

245
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 Yeah, and so there's some of that then they had to really deflect hard

246
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:33,600
 So they made it sort of sci-fi a little more spacey a little more weird a little more fantasy even than Conan and

247
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,560
 Changed the look of he man drastically to keep him away from the Conan comparison. Oh, yeah. Yeah

248
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,800
 No, he man and Conan could never

249
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,240
 They change it super drastically

250
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,640
 One of them is a mostly naked dude with a big fucking sword and the other one's your mom

251
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,400
 Absolutely, it's absolutely

252
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,120
 From Conan. Let's let's don't get it twisted. I know that I know where that stuff like yeah

253
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,160
 But Fisto shows up in the trailer, which is fantastic Fisto's in there spy cores in nor in there or deck man

254
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:15,480
 There's no hordak in the trailer, but Fisto's just just a coincidence in the IP. I'm sure Fisto's in it, but it's great

255
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,580
 I mean they start off with showing Adam in on earth and he's working for HR and they pan over his desk and it says

256
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,080
 Adam Glenn, which is you know, his mom's last name and

257
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,120
 It's got the he him pronouns on there, which is a hilarious joke. Of course. He's he him. He's you know he man

258
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,040
 Just fucking hilarious. Oh, so hilarious. I laughed so hard when it's

259
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,680
 Not only was it funny, it's also a litmus test

260
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,240
 How much would Paul hate that joke in any other movie? No

261
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,920
 It's a litmus test for people who can't stand pronoun shit

262
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,760
 And if you if you focus on that is like a negative thing and don't get it the joke of it all

263
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,560
 I don't I don't know hope for you. He's called he man. What the fuck

264
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,080
 He is all pronoun

265
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,600
 So then you know he goes into this toy shop

266
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,620
 Somehow he finds out that the power the power was the trailer if you're just gonna walk me through it

267
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,120
 This what we're doing is we're reacting to it

268
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,680
 Have you not watched any reaction videos do you not know how this how reaction and break down videos work

269
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,320
 I didn't know we were turning our podcast into a reaction video to the trailer. Oh, it wasn't what?

270
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,480
 That's what's happening. All right. Well, what do you want to talk about about it?

271
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,360
 My question to you was going to be why did you make Jacob and I watch this? What was your plan?

272
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,220
 You just revealed your plan so we could talk about it. Yeah. Yeah, I had already figured out that that was his plan, Matt

273
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,000
 And so I was about to pivot by saying Matt. Did you have any thoughts on the trailer? I

274
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,980
 Here's okay. Let me just address why I don't think it's gonna do the same thing Barbie did. Okay

275
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,060
 Barbie was a comedy

276
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,440
 Yes

277
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,120
 was like a really

278
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,560
 like fun comedy like Casper like really

279
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,620
 sophisticated comedic performers, right and

280
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,760
 It had a nice kind of feminist anthem and it was coming on with against Oppenheimer, which was incredibly masculine

281
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,720
 So there's a good way for like women to rally

282
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,320
 on opening weekend because

283
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,600
 There's a good any contention that just basically wasn't interested in watching a move a three-hour movie about a guy who invented the atomic bomb

284
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,560
 Was gonna maybe go. Yeah, it go out and have fun

285
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:44,240
 This I did the Barbie Heimer day. It was a great day. This movie is made for neither crowd

286
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,000
 I mean, he's made for kids. It's made for

287
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,960
 It's made for Paul

288
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,960
 That's what I think. I think it's really made for Paul because Paul you said you can make your kids watch it

289
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,520
 I'm trying to think if watching this trailer whether whether my kids would be into it or not. I'll find out

290
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,560
 I'll find that's what I want to know. That's what I want to know

291
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,400
 I want to know if a generation removed from all the hype has any interest at all if it does it

292
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,080
 Does it look interesting to people who don't already know what it is? Yeah, I'm seeing I'm seeing yes from a lot of people who don't

293
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,800
 Know in the chat tell us it in the chat

294
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,640
 I'm curious if you were not familiar with the he-man IP already

295
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,400
 Did this trailer make you make you want to watch it or

296
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,520
 Continue to not care about it. Mm-hmm. And actually like I I was just trying to make jokes. I mean, I'm not I

297
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,640
 Wasn't like oh what the fuck about this movie? I just was like, oh, this is kind of I basically like I thought the trailer's kind

298
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,440
 Of weird and I was like, who is this for? That's what I thought when I watch. Yeah. Well, I mean here's think

299
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,120
 We don't know

300
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,920
 How it's gonna be and I'm ready to hate it. I'm ready to hate it. I hated the first one. I did not like that

301
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,100
 Paul is always ready to hate movies about things that he loves

302
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:06,000
 That's what I mean, like I'm not I'm not leave Paul is sincerely prepared to hate this film

303
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,240
 This is a rare is though where I'm optimistic going in even after seeing the trailer. I'm just shocked that your optimistic me, too

304
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,160
 Believe me. I am as shocked as anyone. I was ready to just be like, oh fuck they did it again

305
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,680
 But no, this looks very hopeful to me when you text us last night to watch the trailer

306
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,640
 I thought it was that we were gonna rip it apart. No

307
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,760
 That you can rip it apart if you want to I've already erased my notes once I heard your change of the tone

308
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,580
 I raised my notes. No, do you have a fucking notes?

309
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,840
 My notes

310
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,360
 full of shit

311
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,080
 If there's anything that stood out to you is weird. I mean I was ever taken notes

312
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,360
 It's hard for them to it's hard for them to fight the whole Marvel influence. So that's clearly there

313
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 Yeah, that's clearly there and they and they've definitely toned down the colors of everything

314
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,040
 So it's not quite like it's not that 80s bright

315
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:10,360
 I'm concerned, but it's also not as dark and dreary as the first movie. It's brighter than I'm first

316
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,080
 about the giant cartoon tiger

317
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:20,960
 You have concerns about Cringer and battle cat. I have concerns about the giant cartoon tiger and being able to take

318
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,920
 Scenes with the giant cartoon tiger seriously

319
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,440
 I mean see this is another thing that have two options to go with Cringer or battle cat and you insist on saying cartoon tiger

320
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,100
 I do because that's what it looks like in the trailer. He's a giant cartoon tiger. He's a giant cartoon tiger

321
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:42,560
 I don't know. I I there's something. I mean, I I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. I'm a sucker for I

322
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,800
 Morphized kind of animals and I did love he man as a kid

323
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,120
 And I did love it because I loved Conan Conan the Barbarian. I definitely did

324
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,880
 Definitely did connect the two and like it. Yeah, accordingly

325
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,600
 And I watched the cartoon and stuff when I was younger

326
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,240
 I say I liked it. I liked the toys. I never really watched the cartoon

327
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,680
 You guys are younger than me. I watched Sierra. Yeah, no shit old man

328
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,240
 I know but you really are I mean I was that thing that fucking show got me right in the zone

329
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,520
 Like it hit me exactly right and I know I'm a victim of the Reaganomics

330
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,000
 Fair broadcast standards

331
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,920
 half-hour commercials

332
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,460
 Fuck every Gen X kid train them to buy shit thing. I know I know I

333
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,840
 Don't know

334
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,880
 I just I really I was impressed with what they're doing with the source material

335
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,580
 I'm pleased to see good performers in key roles Idris Elba as man-at-arms

336
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,720
 that is

337
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,200
 Idris Elba in the movie does definitely that is a

338
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,520
 Check in the plus column for sure. I was a brie is evil Lin. Sure. Alison Brie is awesome

339
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
 Um

340
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,640
 And I'm genuinely a bigger Jared Leto fan than you are in general. Well, that's great. And Monarella Buchanan is the sorceress

341
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,720
 in our from Firefly

342
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,400
 Nice like yeah, like that's a great choice for the sorceress

343
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,360
 They've made some really good choice and I don't know who the actress portraying Tila is but she looks wonderful, too

344
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,680
 And you know you talk about the whole feminist thing Matt

345
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,600
 I think not tequila tequila. It's not tequila tequila not get the role. I think you have to remember

346
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,560
 Matt that scoop shooter on the same page that

347
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,320
 Filmation did a really good job

348
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:45,040
 Of putting female characters forward in the time when that was not common like Tila was right there with Adam and and and he man

349
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,520
 Like she held her own

350
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:53,360
 She held her own same thing with the sorceress being the key to the whole secrets of greyskull and the leader of the of the whole

351
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,160
 You know good guy forum and then of course she were being the evolution of that and then it being a very female fronted show

352
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,560
 In fact, they hate women

353
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:11,280
 Who else hates women and that is the following sponsor

354
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,280
 By

355
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 We shouldn't do this one, but I'll read it

356
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,520
 Bill Cosby's guide to consent with a new special forward by Sean pity P. Diddy combs

357
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,680

358
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,800
 Yeah, this is much much cleaner

359
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 Gloria's glory hole hand drill from the sound man scoop in 2021. That is

 You don't have to use it if you don't want to it's fine

366
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,760
 Just leave it all behind

372
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,280

 Grip them with the hand drill

 Gloria's hand drill glory hole

377

 And her hate scoops to check out there you go

378
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,560
 No, what I will tell you Matt back in the day the Mattel executives were very upset because he man

379
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,400
 Was cutting into Barbie sales

380
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,080
 Because they had they had some female forward characters and especially when Princess of Power debuted

381
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,720
 You know, that's kind of why they so I hear you know, I don't mean to cut you off in that like I do it

382
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,120
 I didn't know no, no, I didn't process that. I was talking about like current marketing power and

383
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,480
 They have some great females of great prominent roles. The title is literally he man

384
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,480
 It's literally and the Masters of the universe and the Masters of the universe

385
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,480
 Is it what is it called he man in a Masters universe, I think this one might just be another Masters universe

386
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,360
 I can't remember. Okay. I don't know. I don't know

387
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,320
 I don't know who's got top billing. I can't tell you what I'm trying

388
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,120
 This is like that can all be true from a writing standpoint. It's not from a marketing standpoint, right? Like it's just not oh no for sure

389
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
 I didn't know it was called Masters of the universe

390
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,240
 Is called Masters of the universe great of the universe and it's femininity like there's nothing nothing about the trailer that I saw

391
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,840
 I was like, oh girl girls gonna love and rally around this that's no powering

392
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,980
 Well in the poster has you know, they do love man facing off against scale tour two dudes looking at each other to fight

393
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,600
 So yeah, I get that but it's not this it's not the same brand as as Barbie

394
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,600
 It's not but this is but this is like, you know when the Barbie I'm more like coming from this with like the Barbie

395
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,080
 versus Oppenheimer thing was such a phenomenon and everyone in Hollywood was racing to figure out what the takeaways were going to be and

396
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,120
 None of it seemed to be that women led things can be funny

397
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:26,580
 That said it was like we could do more movies with other toys and I don't know if that was the right take away from an executive

398
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:33,600
 Yes, but learn the wrong lesson or not. They've got good people on the project look

399
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:41,280
 Now maybe you know it is existing IP that's been out there and those are things that people want to make movies out of and so

400
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,620
 Yes for people like yourself and other people who grew up with him in and yeah

401
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,580
 Maybe my kids will their friends will want to go see it and they'll revitalize the franchise for the kids

402
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,160
 You have to do that. You have to try that. I mean you yeah

403
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,000
 Yeah, and scooper Nova girl in the chat is like what you don't think women won't love a mostly sexy naked man with abs fighting

404
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 of course

405
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,400
 It's not you know, you can put me he meant some serious man candy

406
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,640
 He made point

407
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,880
 You know, so there's something he said there episode title

408
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:17,200
 He man candy that reminds me of a story I heard over the weekend of your good friend Murray Sawchuck, Jacob

409
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
 Yeah, I love Murray

410
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,040
 Guy played over this bit has just morphed into just being Murray just being genuinely good

411
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,660
 He gave me that amazing parking spot at his wedding. That's right

412
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
 Oh

413
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,640
 Someone said they're put a college gig and they're like you were so different than the last guy we had and I was like

414
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,200
 It wasn't they go

415
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,920
 They go Murray Sawchuck and he said sarcastically

416
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,880
 Did he show you his abs?

417
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,600
 And they giggled and said we touched his abs. Oh

418
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,960
 No

419
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
 Oh

420
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,880
 He does like an app parade

421
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,000
 Big part of his show the app parade you can have his autograph he can rub his abs and make a wish

422
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,840
 Just do it just do a pencil. They come true a pencil rubbing a charcoal rubbing of his abs

423
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,840
 Just you just push it against his abs and rub and get up

424
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:29,520
 Like like going to the going to the the wall with the Vietnam Memorial Vietnam Memorial. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I get how it goes

425
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
 That's crazy. Well

426
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,360
 Yeah, you know, I don't know. I'm just really excited for it

427
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,120
 I watched a couple reaction videos from many of the careers that I follow who are into action figures, of course

428
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:49,000
 Primarily pixel Dan. I wanted to get pixel Dan's take because I've been following him for decades now. You like talking man

429
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,760
 Pixel Dan is he wrote the book on he man

430
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,440
 He literally has the full compendium of all the action figures and all that kind of thing

431
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,340
 He did or every a review for every figure that came out in the classics line as I was collecting that line

432
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,400
 So he's how I kept up with it and he's got two young boys now himself and they of course know him as a toy

433
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,880
 Enthusiast his

434
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,700
 Livelihood is going to toy shows talking about toys creating toy videos

435
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,540
 So he drags them along to toy shops all the time

436
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,560
 They themselves are not really into he man those two his two young boys, right?

437
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,400
 Ah because that's dad's thing, you know, and that's been right things as he was kidding

438
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,200
 however

439
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,640
 When he showed them this trailer

440
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,120
 Then they asked to get the castles out and they're playing he man again after seeing this trailer

441
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:43,180
 Like you're right then like as an adult looking at singing is like derivative of Marvel

442
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,060
 But in terms of like what kids are growing up on they're growing up on Marvel movies

443
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,960
 So if it right if it feels like it scratches that it just probably to make kids more interested in seeing it

444
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,320
 Absolutely, and you know he man is a superhero. This is what it's what it's about. It's about empowerment

445
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
 That's what the whole superhero thing is about

446
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,040
 it's about empowerment and that's you know, I mean Marvel is no less guilty of going to the

447
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,240
 Lowest levels of marketing research to do, you know, I don't know if you're familiar with secret wars

448
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,000
 You familiar secret wars. Yeah, so that all came from just marketing

449
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,920
 Marketing meetings about what do kids like they love the word

450
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,880
 They love secrets and they love Star Wars slash wars and so they go. Oh, let's just do see

451
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,920
 Department of our government to the Department of War. Oh, yeah, that's what we love. That's what the kids love kids

452
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,600
 Don't that war and now it's a secret war that's going on in broad daylight that we can't really talk about

453
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,200
 So fun, so fun all these secret wars

454
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,800
 Where's the fucking Beyonder to fix this shit? No, he started he started it all we did Adam Warlock. That's what we need

455
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,460
 No, but that's the whole thing of

456
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,480
 Where do you find that say that you have a right to carry a thing?

457
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,400
 But they shoot you because you carry the thing. Do you have the right to carry the thing? I don't know

458
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,080
 Colleges is like

459
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,720
 It's a real head-scratcher there Jacob, yeah, yeah god damn it

460
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,000
 Fuck anyway, that's a part of it too. This is coming out like a week later

461
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,860
 So we should say like who knows what other atrocities have had. Oh god

462
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:24,200
 Yeah, that's true. We are we are recording this is like a couple days earlier than we usually record it

463
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,520
 So that is one of the two extra days

464
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,080
 Right one other thing about the Masters Universe property and the movie it filled me with some hope

465
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,680
 Which is something we're in desperate need of right now

466
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,720
 It's something what cinema should be focusing on for sure he meant yeah, and he man is a bright spot

467
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,040
 Masters Universe has been a big bright spot in my life and

468
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,600
 You know, I love the mythology behind it and that's the thing

469
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,520
 Like I said, they are adhering to the true lore and mythology. They're playing with it, but that's fine

470
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,240
 That's what it has to you have to do that

471
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,720
 You have to you know toy with it a bit

472
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,120
 But I love the interpretation so far of like the vehicles that I'm seeing

473
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,640
 And all that kind of thing like they've you know, it looks like rotons going through this guy

474
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,640
 But you couldn't have a roton looking like a fucking roton if it looks stupid, but it looks cool. It looks really cool

475
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,760
 What's the roton? What's the roton? The roton is the vehicle that you would push along and had a thing

476
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,020
 It looked like it. Well, it looked like a spaceship with a giant. What is it in the trailer?

477
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,680
 It's the spaceships that have like two a little orb being encircled by

478
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,160
 Got you a spinny big says that because the toy that was the toy with the it was on wheels, right?

479
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,960
 It had a wheel at the base and as you push the saw blade would rotate and it looked like it looks like a saw blade

480
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,800
 Around a car. Yeah, right

481
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,280
 Which as an adult, I recognize isn't terribly practical mark gates in the chat. Yes, you're exactly right

482
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,940
 Roton is the stuff you put in queso dip. Yeah, get yourself a can of roton and

483
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,680
 You are ready you are ready for some salsa

484
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,880
 Yeah, did you see the Superman trailer before the super movie came out? What did you think of it then?

485
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,800
 I did not watch the Superman trailer. I purposefully did not watch the Superman trailer to keep my

486
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,640
 surprise that you were an advocate of watching the trailer because you are

487
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:23,400
 Traditionally, I usually I know I know but this is so dear to my heart and I didn't want to get you couldn't help yourself

488
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,960
 I didn't want to get inadvertently spoiled. I was like, I'm just gonna go and take it in and I was pleasantly surprised

489
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,560
 You know, I'm just really I'm really enthused about the direction. I see so far. There's every possibility

490
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
 It's a shit show. We haven't heard any dialogue

491
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,600
 We haven't heard anything, you know who the fuck knows how the story is gonna play out, but it looks good

492
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:50,080
 Having Marlena give that gravitas of like we hid you away so you wouldn't be killed by these like there's real threat there

493
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,280
 I that's kind of cool

494
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,600
 You gotta send your child to another planet in order to not have him kidnapped by an evil space dictator. That's kind of neat

495
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:04,120
 That tells me that they're respecting the fact that adora was kidnapped in the past and that traumatized the fuck out of Marlena

496
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,800
 So she sent her child to another planet. That's big. I

497
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
 Don't know I

498
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,680
 Since the last starfighter

499
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:19,760
 Yeah, what'd you say Matt? Yeah, who are you gonna dress as when you go to see it in the theater? That's a good question

500
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,360
 I've been thinking about it already what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna put on, you know, my favorite he-man shirt

501
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,160
 That's all I'll just put on my favorite Masters Universe shirt. You're just gonna show up as the OG

502
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:36,320
 You're just gonna show up and be like I've been here since the beginning. Mm-hmm, and I'm still here. Yeah, I mean, I'm a big guy

503
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,520
 I've always contemplated doing Ramman cosplay would go as orco thirsty scoop in the chat is right. I used to have

504
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,100
 I used to have an orco outfit. It didn't look good though

505
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,200
 It was one of those like hoodies that also had a mask and a silly hat. It was okay

506
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,040
 It just didn't look right. I ended up losing that in the move, but

507
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,600
 Yeah, an orco hasn't shown up yet. So that's another thing that could happen

508
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,360
 But that could be another thing like they might just they might just be pausing that for now. Does that's another whole thing?

509
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,200
 I'm gonna dress as an incredibly angry goose

510
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,600
 Everybody go like oh Fisto. I get it

511
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:18,080
 How fast I got that

512
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:28,140
 It is terrible it says bad things about me as a human being how fast I got that

513
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,360
 Pisto the goose. Oh

514
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,720
 my

515
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,200
 Yeah, so I don't know I'll go and then even

516
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,560
 Scooper Dover girl was asking early in the chat about popcorn buckets. I'm like, oh shit. Who knows who knows what kind of pop?

517
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,060
 Oh, yeah, they've had a collectible shit. You're gonna be oh, well, that's the whole thing

518
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:53,160
 They've already solicited like ten new figures and you know, who knows how long that line already. It's gonna be broke

519
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,240
 I'm already collecting three damn he-man lines as it is, you know

520
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,620
 Calm everyone preaching fun calm to be on the street. Help me afford

521
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,760
 Destitute please. He is gonna be on the street people is I need my plan teaching fun calm

522
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,400
 I need my plastic man McPheeters home

523
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,080
 What does it come out

524
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,560
 June 5th. Oh

525
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,640
 I believe so I'm so angry that it's not until June and we have to hear about this until June. No, no, no

526
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,320
 No, no. No, this was gonna be

527
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,960
 This is the big discussion. I wanted to have and again again

528
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,920
 I just want to lay it out there that I'm very hopeful. I'm very pleased with what I saw so far

529
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,920
 I am ready to shit on it if it turns out to be garbage, you know, I will you know, I hate I know

530
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,440
 You know, I hated that latest Tron movie. I love the soundtrack, you know, there's

531
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,280
 You know, I'm not I'm not partial to my IP. I'm not blind to the holes in my IP

532
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,640
 But that's also you hate things that you love the beautiful thing about

533
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,040
 Masters of the universe is that it really is a tool for imagination and exploration and

534
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:11,560
 Back when I played with my figures most of my Lord came from what I'd read in the little mini comics

535
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,800
 I I would ignore a lot of the

536
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,240
 Filmation stuff. I loved hordak. I

537
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,880
 Do not care for the filmation depiction of hordak at all. That is that's hashtag

538
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,600
 Not my hordak with that and snorting like a pig half the time. No, thank you. That's not that's not me

539
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:39,240
 That's just a weird that was a weird choice. So I said good day hordak. I do say good day hordak because he's a cool-looking villain

540
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,200
 So we'll see

541
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,440
 We'll see but I'm I can't wait. I teared up

542
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,680
 You know movie got to me the preview got to me. So, you know, it doesn't take much

543
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,440
 I'm on ice already. Well, the whole country's falling apart and then I see he man come hanging around. I'm like, oh

544
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,000
 Yeah, there you go

545
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,520
 Yeah, that's a really weird thing happened to me the other day. Uh-huh. What's that? I was walking down the strip and a

546
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,800
 party bus like a big limo party bus

547
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,160
 Which is not uncommon comes rolling down the strip right next to and I'm you know, I'm on Vegas Boulevard there

548
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
 I'm on the sidewalk walking down the road and

549
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
 that this bus has a

550
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,880
 Roll down windows. It's all the windows are rolled down and the whole thing is just filled with what looks like

551
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,240
 I don't know 13 year old girls 12 13 year old girls

552
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,320
 young tween girls and

553
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:42,440
 They are all leaned out the bus windows heading to the trunk. I'm the only I am the only person on the sidewalk

554
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,080
 Okay, I'm the only person around

555
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:53,520
 They are all leaned out the window and when they see me they all do the hand thing and yell six seven thing

556
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:01,400
 Okay, yes, and they keep on driving and I believe that has triggered a full midlife crisis

557
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:11,040
 They broke your brain I think they broke me I'm done god damn I am out

558
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,000
 This has I I stood there for a minute

559
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,320
 Just going I don't even know just dumbfounded, huh? Should I step into traffic should I?

560
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,480
 Just it's a rap, huh? What should I do now?

561
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,560
 And I'm walking like I am more than halfway through my life I really am

562
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:41,000
 Like I I have lived more years already that I'm probably going to live

563
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,320
 Yeah, that's that's probably true. Yeah

564
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:52,040
 That's a that's a way that's a hell of a way to measure it with that with that kind of event happening to really clock

565
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,040
 That but yeah, it's because those those children with their their Terminator vision, which they would have a reference

566
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:05,680
 To you and said old man engaged six seven him six seven him

567
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,400
 Also, I was like I wanted to go in and stop them and be like hey the six seven thing is out guys

568
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,960
 That's done. I don't know where you guys have been but that's that is simply out. I know that it's weird that you don't

569
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:28,600
 I'm so sorry Jacob. Thank you. Thank you

570
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:36,600
 Continues to be dramatic if it's any dramatic if it's any consolation, I think you've lived at least two-thirds of your life, you know

571
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,160
 See this is another thing Jacob

572
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:48,800
 you know if you were like me and you were obsessed with a childhood toy property for the majority of your existence and

573
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
 and and

574
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,280
 You know even when there was lean times even when nobody was talking about the universe

575
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,580
 You were in it in it to win it and now take that away from you

576
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:06,720
 You know what I mean, but this is the thing back. I feel like Jacob think if they were making an Archie Manning video

577
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
 Oh

578
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:25,000
 Now I get it now I thank you Matt for clarifying that now I understand

579
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:33,480
 That's what it that is what it does though. It does kind of give you the level of like a Bobby a bear documentary

580
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,580
 The deep cut for you fucking Saints fans out there

581
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,800
 Of

582
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
 tweens on a bus yelling at me

583
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,280
 To pass the time we took in a comedy special Eric Dillman recommended his friend Renan Hirschberg on YouTube

584
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,700
 Okay, his newest specials called morbidly Jewish

585
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,400
 And I won't try to do anything but you're too much from it

586
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,960
 But the one thing really made me what lots of made me laugh really hard at it. But what was he goes, you know?

587
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,920
 Harry Potter got in trouble for like, you know having you know

588
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,320
 The people run in the bank or these like goblin people and they were like, oh, that's it. Yeah

589
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,820
 the green gods and that's anti-semitic and he goes

590
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:54,680
 Isn't watching made-up creatures and thinking they're Jewish stereotypes more anti-semitic than the green gods being anti-semitic

591
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,820
 I put nothing path JK Rowling though. She's right intentions

592
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,760
 Actually, you know, she meant all

593
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:18,260
 Definitely if you have a chance to got morbidly Jewish on you, that sounds funny. Nice. What's his name again, Renan Hirschberg?

594
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,760
 Ra a na n you say he's Jewish. I

595
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,640
 Yes, okay

596
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:33,200
 Let's do a little scooperty here we got a scooper here from Smitty scoop here like you know, I'm from New Jersey Paul, right?

597
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,880
 Uh-huh. That's how you'll know that he's Jewish got it. Yeah

598
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,800
 Because Matt Donnelly told you you got it

599
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,760
 Gentlemen, well Matt won the first Smitty scooperty of 2026

600
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:52,640
 But it may be a bit premature to declare that Matt has officially dethroned Paul and Jacob and reclaimed the Smitty scooperty crown

601
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,320
 So I prepared another scooperty for your enjoyment to give Paul and Jacob a chance to redeem themselves. Here we go

602
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:06,280
 The categories are winter Olympics geography sitcom spouses and hard

603
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,660
 Shit. All right. Oh, I'll start with hard for 400. Here we go

604
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,280
 Rachel what's for dinner? I'm married to Rachel Maddow

605
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,220
 Now my giant brother still wants to fuck my wife. My mom and dad are mean. Oh boy

606
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,640

 Yeah, okay

609
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:44,160
 That was so confusing Paul, that's a crazy quote

610
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,960
 I'll try sitcom spouses for 1200

611
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,360

 What is the name of the character played by Patricia Heaton for nine seasons on everybody loves Raymond

615
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,200
 I'm really glad because when I was answering the last question

616
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,460
 I did have to pause for a moment go like wait

617
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,160
 Was it every was it everybody loves Raymond or everyone loves Raymond loves Raymond, but

 The name of the wife I got to pass. I don't know

627
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:06,720
 No, both Wyoming and Utah share a border with Colorado and Idaho, but Colorado and Idaho do not border each other. Damn it

628
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,740
 Oh, I'm seeing in the chat. I'm seeing the chat. Barone was Raymond's last name in the show

635
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:02,860

636
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,200
 Oh

637
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,660

 9

643
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:37,120
 Is correct. It's called the 9 dart finish or 9 darter and it is considered to be on par with a 300 game in bowling

644
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,040
 Hooray for me. Did you know that or did you guess it's a guess it was either 9 or 12. Oh

645
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,900
 Matt you're up. Oh, yeah, cuz you'd have to hit the triple 20 you have to get just right every time until hitting the until

646
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,320
 Hitting the double bulls. Yes. I guess you'd have to hit the bulls eye at one point. But yeah, whatever

647
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:02,160
 Rock hard for 1200, please. Yeah

 Including the pincer claws now, Matt

651
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,720
 Usually you don't include the pincer claws

652
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:29,720
 When you count crab legs this time make sure that you do I see the legs his legs and the claws his arms

653
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:35,080
 That's the way I brought up right. I was taught my town. Yes. Yeah wonderful. See

654
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:42,400
 Everyone's favorite claw full in the master's universe movie. Oh, of course having a big claw pincer arm. I

655
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,000
 Hope so not at all like fisto

00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,640
 Who has an exact arm exactly like that? There was like there was three of those guys. There was claw full

 There was fisto and there was jitsu. They all had fucked up hands. Oh

660
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,000
 I'm sorry, it's B

661
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,840
 You forgot about the pincer claws

662
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:14,680
 See them as arms

663
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,460
 You will not go back on that Lindsay in the chat says she just wants some claws in her mouth

664
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:26,280

 Yes, but not on I-15 which passes through a small sliver of Arizona

670
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:59,400
 Nevada and Utah share a 240 mile long border and I 80 crosses this border fucking I always forget about I 80

671
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:06,280
 Matt doesn't count the pincer arms on the crabs and I don't count I 80. I said it was I 80 with that low

672
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,480
 because I didn't know I 80 goes pretty low, but because it goes it goes from the

 So he's breaking in all these Crips and shit, and this has been going on for years

741
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,200
 He's been stealing all these bodies and keeping them at his house and selling some of the parts

 And he's just into all this macabre shit. He's got a fucking

 He definitely did and they found um

751
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,120
 They found him out by a couple of different methods

752
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,500
 But one of the key ways that they traced him

753
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,160
 He was leaving energy drinks at the scenes

754
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,180

01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,520
