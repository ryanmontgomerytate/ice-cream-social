 We're preaching fun.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
 Hey everybody.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:27,800
 I'll tell you what I am preaching fun but I accidentally just bummed myself out yesterday.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 Oh.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
 Oh no.

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
 What did you do?

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 So it's.

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,440
 Did you read the newspaper?

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,320
 Well this is the thing right so I don't listen to news podcasts anymore I'll listen to Justin

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,520
 Robert Young when I feel like I can take it.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
 Right sure.

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 When I feel like I'm okay.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
 It's absolutely yep.

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,720
 Because he tells it like it is and the way he's telling it.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,600
 I don't like the way it is and the rest of the time you normally just play myself with

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
 sports podcasts and right now there's not a lot of sports happening.

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
 And so.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
 Right.

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:13,920
 I was going to the back catalog of Pablo Torre explains was it explains all that's Clarissa.

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,440
 I also always get Pablo Torre and Clarissa confused.

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
 Yeah.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
 Easy to do.

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 Yeah.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
 Finds out.

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
 Pablo Torre.

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
 Finds out.

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
 Melissa Jonard.

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,200
 And they're talking about this like obscure statistician guy from the 80s doing like a

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,840
 deep dive and this guy who was kind of ahead of the Saber Metrics thing before that became

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
 a thing.

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,160
 If anyone doesn't know what we're talking about it's like the basically the nerds won

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,600
 breaking down baseball and the nerds won breaking down basketball and he was the first nerd

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,640
 to break down basketball and he was.

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
 Is he the is he the moneyball to basketball that the moneyball guy was the baseball correct

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
 the guy Bill James who started who started the moneyball craze he was in the moneyball

61
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,200
 GM but he was the guy who first started kind of breaking down baseball as a solid thing

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,480
 anointed this guy whose name I'm forgetting as the moneyball basketball.

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
 Yeah.

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,380
 But that guy did not go on to have different success and basically I guess I guess trigger

65
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,400
 warning suicide oh no we yeah.

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,680
 He didn't have depression he didn't feel like he should have done something he literally

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
 laid out an argument like he that have arguments for basketball players he was a very laid

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,080
 out argument oh wow that he basically wanted to end his life specifically on his 60th birthday

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,560
 and just be done with it and.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,320
 When you say this bummed you out huh.

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,620
 This this super upbeat story somehow you're out you've got like three years what are you

72
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
 worried about man.

73
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,080
 And I'm thinking I'm reading you know I'm at the gym I'm walking my kids soccer practice

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,700
 I just was like reading about the subsurface statistician you know yeah and then that takes

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,920
 a turn and I'm sure there's a warning in the notes I never read the episode notes you know

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,360
 right.

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,600
 And so but it was like also fascinating you know like he wrote all these emails to his

78
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,280
 family and put them to be sent hours after his death.

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,000
 He made sure he like he really set it all up yeah he made sure to do it at the back

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,200
 parking lot of a police department so he could call nine one one so he could be an organ

81
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,600
 donor and no one who hadn't dealt with death would have to see him besides people who were

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,780
 in charge of doing that.

83
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:51,720
 Like it was this very crazy intricately thing yeah yeah yeah and it really I'm inspired

84
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,360
 I'm not depressed by this I'm inspired by this pump the brakes we got a scoop vest today

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:07,780
 Jacob slow down slow your roll oh you are not helping your case sir I know I know.

86
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,200
 And I was like oh man and then I was like well I'm going to get off you know I still

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,320
 had some walking to do at the soccer practice and so I was like I'll switch over and I decided

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,460
 to listen to two characters and a clown.

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
 Which one?

90
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:31,920
 The last one oh it's over right so I'm just gonna tell you this it is a fascinating one

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,760
 to listen to because when they start the episode they don't know they're doing their last episode

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:46,280
 really oh yes it's that much that much of a thing huh oh I did I had no idea right it's

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,400
 not a bad blood thing is it no it's fascinating again another really fascinating it's just

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,680
 a mutual agreement that they're done yes but everybody's still amicable the everybody's

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,480
 still friends still working with each other backstage and still loving each other what

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,520
 happens is you kind of listen to the episode and I knew that this was their last episode

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,640
 so it was fascinating to listen to it unfold it was fascinating to hear them realize it

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,760
 yeah but so I knew it was their last episode but I thought it was going to be them coming

99
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
 on air to talk about why they're going to do their last episode and instead I listened

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,840
 to 11 minutes of them talking about crab cakes and fish cakes and I'm like this is really

101
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,920
 weird and then it's like so clear that they have and those words have to forgive me for

102
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,160
 I mean I don't know I'm just going to talk about it but like it's so clear that there's

103
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,960
 a bunch of straws on the back of the Campbell's so to speak right now they're talking about

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,760
 how things are changing at work they're talking about that things that those are dealing with

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,560
 at home and then they talk about getting a complaint email from a listener and then they

106
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,920
 kind of get into like why why no I don't want to go I want to talk to you guys but I don't

107
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,000
 want to talk about stuff on there like I don't want to worry about what I'm saying oh hey

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,600
 to you guys right and like it is it is it is a fascinating listen because it's very

109
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,840
 clear Jimmy is the first one who's out right but realize yeah so yeah so for this you have

110
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,760
 to know that the podcast is two characters and it's three friends of ours they all work

111
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,640
 backstage at a Cirque du Soleil show they've been doing a podcast for three and a half

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,120
 years and well they all work on stage they're all three performers at a Cirque du Soleil

113
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,480
 show yeah they're literally two characters in the show and a clown yeah yeah and and

114
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,120
 and you still have if you're just skirmish now you have three and a half years of fine

115
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,720
 episodes yeah for instance I just subscribed to it I'm really looking forward to catching

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:59,440
 up when there's like a half hour left maybe a little more RJ makes a big like dark night

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,480
 of the soul speech to Jimmy like really tries to get Jimmy to like understand and feel his

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:15,360
 like value things like this and Jimmy is having none of it like none of it and that was really

119
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
 that's what really it was hurting me it was like hurt it was like yeah to listen you know

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,760
 it does that doesn't listen to that I was like so buddy you know he's he's telling Jimmy

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,480
 how valuable Jimmy is and Jimmy's like yeah okay yeah and Jimmy's not buying it right

122
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,960
 what come on Jimmy exactly and then it's really funny because then Johnny just comes in right

123
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,880
 and starts talking and I timed it RJ doesn't speak for 25 minutes after his big speech

124
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:51,440
 nothing so I was like oh Johnny's the only one who knows who thinks this is still a podcast

125
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,640
 right now I think RJ knew on the big speech and when it was just letting with nothing

126
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:07,720
 he was like no we're done we're done and then oh wow and then so you know I mean spoiler

127
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,560
 it's it's a fascinating listen so I'm not even I mean I'm it's all spoiler but it's

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,720
 all yeah it's all fessing listen oh listen anyway RJ just goes back and he goes so why

129
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,640
 don't we just stop doing like right like F is not speaking at all wants to do it Johnny

130
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,760
 is caught off guard I don't think people realize even even RJ's friends even me yeah I I fall

131
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,960
 into this trap too I forget what a thinker RJ is yes RJ will sit and think and ponder

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,460
 over something and then when he comes back into the conversation he's got it all straight

133
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,600
 and out total and you don't realize it for a minute or two yes big heart big brain that

134
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,640
 boy of course just yeah really loves his voice and he literally just he says let's stop doing

135
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,920
 the podcast on there you can't hear you know you're it's an audio podcast Johnny's struck

136
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,400
 and RJ goes look how big the smile on Jimmy's face is and Johnny does it goes oh you're

137
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:13,980
 right it's over and then and I was like walking around my neighborhood like I had to push

138
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:21,040
 pause to like make dinner for my kids and I was like god damn it I was like riveting

139
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,280
 I was just like kids ruined everything crawling with discomfort my friends and also like totally

140
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:33,480
 enthralled and then I had to like table it for an hour and then go finish it on a nightwalk

141
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:42,400
 and I was just like I was teary eyed walking I was like just it was the most crazy podcast

142
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,600
 episode ever like I couldn't believe it I think it's hilarious but I had honestly been

143
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,840
 saving it because I was saving it's the strong word but I've been saving it because I was

144
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,360
 like oh they've got their last episode up I've got a you know basic time to listen to it

145
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,280
 now I'm just fascinated yeah no I know cuz like you know I was trying we were lining

146
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,160
 them up for a trivia battle right and so that's when RJ let me know that he's like oh I don't

147
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,800
 I don't think that's a good idea I was like what and same thing I was like bad blood anything

148
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,680
 he's like no no no no no everybody's happy and so it just it was just so clear that the

149
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:30,740
 choice to be a podcaster just wasn't what they wanted to do you know well it was a secondary

150
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,800
 there's a secondary choice well that's it they bring us up at the very end they bring

151
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,520
 the big up this podcast at the very end and and saying they don't want to become what

152
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 we are right they see our they see our world as a burden and well they also have real jobs

153
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,440
 that was like I could like scream across the my headphones what's I was like I was like

154
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:04,480
 you know I we this podcast is what we are like yeah right we we we weren't very successful

155
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,080
 guys doing something else I thought you know I know shed a little light this is this is

156
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,960
 our successful thing and then we use this to bounce into other possibilities and entrepreneurialism

157
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,560
 this is our Cirque du Soleil this is yeah this is what we're walking the tightrope right

158
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,920
 now baby this is the thing when we tell people about this thing people go oh exactly when

159
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,360
 they tell people about Cirque du Soleil people go oh right we tell people about our little

160
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,400
 podcast and people are like oh that's very nice for you guys no one goes up to them after

161
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,080
 their shows it was like should you guys podcast also because I really want more of you guys

162
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,320
 so scoop scoop Jesus is say Jacob was successful and that's true but I think Jacob will also

163
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,920
 make the point that as successful as he is and he is very good at his job and has a lot

164
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,860
 of success as a sound guy he still gets a lot of interactions with fellow performers

165
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,560
 who are like this is a different thing how do you make this podcast thing cook how do

166
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,400
 you write this is a very different thing than what I do and I tell you what to to to Matt's

167
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
 point and you're talking to the guys about you know doing there doing the Cirque shows

168
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,980
 and then doing the podcasting stuff I would be a very different podcaster if I didn't

169
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,040
 have a day job every time I talk about quitting running shows SJ lets me have it she's like

170
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,920
 what are you talking about you're just gonna podcast all the time if you don't run shows

171
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,520
 you're just gonna podcast all the time what are you gonna talk about on these podcasts

172
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,320
 right it's true it's true you gotta have you gotta have some external life you gotta

173
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,640
 have some external life before it comes in yeah yeah yeah this is this is a whole different

174
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,000
 thing from from what I do when I go to when I go in and run a show I mean I sit back there

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,460
 I'm executing somebody else's vision I'm doing all these types of things here you know it's

176
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,840
 us it's it's like we're this is our thing we get to do whatever we want on this because

177
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,320
 it's us yeah also we also all three don't work with each other right like so like one

178
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,520
 of the fun I was gonna say we don't share a dressing room we get yeah we get a break

179
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,880
 but but no but with that like the whole reason why I love why I wanted to do the podcast

180
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,080
 with Paul in the first place was I was I was a dad and I was and all I like to do for my

181
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:25,320
 entire teens and 20s was bits all I want was bits all I want to do is bust balls and make

182
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,360
 jokes with friends and I knew that being a dad would make that go away a lot not all

183
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,880
 the way but a lot compared to what I was sure and so I was like oh get let's get in a space

184
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:46,600
 where we can make fun of stuff and good calls and so it was definitely like a big time branch

185
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,400
 for me both personally professionally to like get this going so yeah but that but and that's

186
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,440
 things like so I said texting with RJ afterward like like yeah this is what podcasting is

187
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,780
 to me and you guys don't require any of it you know right you don't require any of it

188
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,920
 so it was really interesting I mean because they do all three of them share that dressing

189
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,880
 room right it was there yeah yeah and like I don't know how we would do that I would

190
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,920
 say I don't know if we had if we had a dressing if we saw each other off microphone and off

191
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,260
 camera all the time I don't know how we'd still do a show totally yeah and especially

192
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,640
 if it gets like uh touch and go whether we can talk about where we work together or not

193
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:45,000
 right right oh yeah that's huge um and I would say that I think I think that the maybe the

194
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,680
 toughest time for this actually the pandemic second toughest time for this podcast uh was

195
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,200
 when Paul and I worked together worked together oh sure I think I think 50 shades was probably

196
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,880
 the a harder spot yeah and it became the dominating uh talking point like we'd had to we had to

197
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,300
 purposely branch out from that yeah yeah yeah I mean we literally butted heads were like

198
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,480
 I didn't care about biting the hand that fed me and Paul was like this is a bad idea to

199
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:20,520
 bite the hand that feeds you well yeah and uh and and it was a long term right Matt didn't

200
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,840
 care about it and Paul did yeah and I and I shouldn't have I shouldn't have given a

201
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,600
 fuck shouldn't have given a roaring fuck but it's easy to say that when we're when we're

202
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,920
 out of it it's easy to say we shouldn't have cared about something that we're no longer

203
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,160
 inside of yeah yeah yeah it is it's like people it's hard to say you don't care about people

204
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,360
 while you're inside of them it is hard to say that I've I've done my best yeah uh and

205
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,720
 that's not the only time Paul did that when we did the scoop cruise I was making fun of

206
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,720
 the opening uh show in the elevator right and they and our passengers got off the elevator

207
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,960
 and Paul let me have it and by the way that was very helpful Paul was like do not talk

208
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,960
 shit about anything everyone reports everything to everyone on cruise ships everybody has

209
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,200
 ears you cannot yeah uh as an entertainer talk shit uh he was right then even though

210
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,960
 I my pride didn't want him to be and um and I don't think I was too mean about it you

211
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,640
 were you were not I was probably serious about it you were very serious and very direct about

212
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,760
 it you were not you were you were direct about it I wouldn't say you were mean about it but

213
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,160
 you were direct about it well because I I'd done nine months on a cruise ship yeah yeah

214
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,880
 you were just you were just real about it live that fucking life baby yeah well on some

215
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,200
 things like I'm not like that moment was would turn out to be very key to what I'm doing

216
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,880
 now like so like I'm not saying you're out of you're wrong in any way I'm saying like

217
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,120
 in hindsight like I was like right not only were you right then but I'm even more grateful

218
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:59,240
 now I go right I go on cruise ships like everything is bugged exactly and it is because it is

219
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,720
 it fucking is I mean seriously fucking Orkin man you go to enough ports where everyone's

220
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,920
 toting machine guns and you get a little sense in your mind like oh there could be some shit

221
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,160
 going down I bet people are really looking out for stuff yeah you know what I mean like

222
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,680
 you know yeah you go to enough places where you're like oh there's some serious military

223
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,680
 hardware like back in these ports they're not gonna they're not gonna let games get

224
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,280
 played yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh I'll tell you who doesn't let games get played in their

225
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,320
 ports and that is the following sponsor today's show no I don't believe it today sure the

226
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,240
 show that the show I don't think anything anytime soon it's brought to you no they didn't

227
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:49,600
 think it was either uh Matt and Mattingly's meet the wolf man act for scene three Matt

228
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,200
 escapes the wolf man by prepping him to perform unfool us from scoop John Fink we now take

229
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:08,520
 you to act for scene three of Matt Mattingly meet the wolf man yes great job wolf man love

230
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,940
 the pizzazz you have to get that giant dirty thick fingernail underneath two cards but then

231
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,960
 at the top of the deck with him hold it as one you're gonna lift it up oh man I'm trying

232
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,600
 these paws ain't cooperate very good it's just called a double lift you can still lift

233
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,600
 up both cards and show it to the artist like one what do you say we rearrange my appointment

234
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:40,200
 time for a full moon and I could just do my straight transformation routine the problem

235
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,320
 is that Lincoln that fools likes to bump people around depending on the schedule and your

236
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,920
 local so he knows he can bump you around so you're not gonna get the spot that we can't

237
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,720
 rely on that's fine I get it I get it but I mean I'm a rare reverse werewolf I'm wolf

238
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,280
 man all the time except during a full moon I understand I understand why don't we just

239
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,440
 rehearse some of the lines like so so Penn and Teller did I fool you want to try that

240
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:22,000
 one so Penn and Teller did I fool you okay I feel like the fool is a little long oh I've

241
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:33,320
 been going to speech therapy for a long time but it just don't take yeah yeah no I understand

242
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:42,160
 I think you got a rabbit I could eat can't you pull one out of your hat yeah come on

243
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,740
 stereotype my ass that's why I got in the biz oh did you win your team's high school

244
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,760
 basketball championship while we're doing while we're doing stereotypes back and forth

245
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,640
 did you come here riding on top of your friend's van just because my best friend happened to

246
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:09,480
 be Stiles very common team will preferences is there a young lady named Booth that has

247
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,560
 some of your attention but not as much as it should I can't believe her name was boof

248
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:32,840
 man what was her name remember proposing that we should just end the show at episode one

249
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:41,120
 thousand oh yeah yeah and that bothered Paul a lot what I even just well I I quickly fixed

250
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,480
 it and said no that's the beginning of season two we're off to the races oh I saved myself

251
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,380
 for another thousand episodes season two might be the last season it might be the season

252
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,960
 one might have been the penultimate season that's we're going to the third season here

253
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,840
 I think we don't know how long season two might be oh well I mean it's gonna be a thousand

254
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:09,160
 episodes at least at least I guess we know a season is at least a thousand episodes maybe

255
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,840
 for for for bit sake it's a thousand and one and then season season three starts on one

256
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,760
 thousand two oh that's are explained to a friend the other day that asked about a friend

257
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,160
 of mine was asking about podcast season remember that note for seven years but yes keep keep

258
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,960

259
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,560

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:42,200
 pick this ball up my children and all and all of your dogs my dogs will be long dead

261
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,000
 before that you won't whatever incarnation of whatever whatever sled dog team you currently

262
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,480
 are adopting or fostering okay oh my god you're right it's never gonna stop yeah so speaking

263
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,180
 of my dogs talking to Matt's kids the reason I was a little bit behind today was we're

264
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,480
 working with a contractor who their mascot is a little corgi dog in a hard hat so it's

265
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,320
 really cute so that helped get all right all right let's say let's say percentage give

266
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 me a percentage how much of a percentage of of you selecting this contractor had to do

267
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,960
 with that image oh eighty percent easily good okay because because that was part of it and

268
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,280
 and sent me that link and everything and we we saw that so we're like yeah like we're

269
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,600
 good to go so uh yeah it was really you know they know their market uh yeah these are exterior

270
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,880
 house uh painters and what do you call it and so uh ann had been looking to get some

271
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,460
 work done on the exterior of the house for a long time and she's already had you know

272
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,760
 ideas sent out to uh professional planescapers that can make it look like you know how they

273
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,840
 want and so she's got all the great the paint ideas set everything set and we got finally

274
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,760
 a consultation today they had to move their time back a little bit just because they were

275
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,480
 super busy but the we're supposed to be meeting at noon we ended up meeting closer to one

276
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,040
 so that's why i got pushed back a little bit time-wise but looks like everything's gonna

277
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:15,960
 move forward and hopefully by october we're gonna have new exterior uh colors and uh things

278
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,000
 done and also the big thing the brickwork the brickwork which i might add that allowed

279
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,280
 for the entrance of one squirrel into my basement so the uh so the lack of brickwork the lack

280
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,680
 of brickwork so we're gonna get that all touched up they can do that as well so we're gonna

281
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:42,680
 get that all patched up and they're gonna do this process uh called uh lime washing

282
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,880
 cutting the brakes in that truck they absolutely are they went in but we're gonna get it limed

283
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,440
 washed and uh it's gonna look really nice so the brick the brickwork's gonna get touched

284
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,480
 up masoned in fixed up and then what's the lime washing do uh it makes it look white

285
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,440
 essentially okay instead of you know different shades of of white instead of the regular

286
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,680
 brick color that we have got there right now oh so oh it's what it makes it lighten up

287
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:14,120
 okay exactly some of it is kind of like falling apart there is a piece of brick missing from

288
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,120
 the very front of our house where it's really close to a vent for the air conditioning system

289
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,960
 and i could look in that vent and i could see outside of my house and so i was like

290
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:34,040
 okay so currently well that's event the mattingly fix that's going on for that piece of brickwork

291
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:41,920
 right now is a big goopy chunk of great stuff i scored it into the wall so you've got all

292
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,840
 this brick and then this hunk of yellow nasty just hanging off the side but you can't get

293
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,840
 back i would have suggested a towel i would have suggested just shoving a towel in there

294
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,080
 no it wouldn't have a towel wouldn't have worked it wasn't that big of a gap but it

295
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,360
 was big enough okay the great stuff worked so there you go uh yeah yes i know ranch slunky

296
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,680
 we can't paint uh exactly so the lime washer allows this that's interesting look at that

297
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,160
 perfect ranch slunk coming through with the info ranch slunk in the chat says uh brick

298
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,600
 should not be painted as it needs to breathe lime wash allows for this so that it does

299
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,920
 not crumble due to weathering exactly uh gosh that's a big shame because all of the brick

300
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,600
 on the on my house is all painted we finally gave him his thank you and then he's coming

301
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,440
 off everywhere with these facts it's pretty great i doubt well i'll tell you i'll tell

302
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,960
 you jacob your brickwork is probably safe given the environment that it's in i don't

303
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,120
 have any there's no moisture getting exactly it's so bone dry it's not going to be a thing

304
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,520
 but he was just telling us about a painted brick situation that they're dealing with

305
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,880
 on another home they spent four days trying to get the paint working to get the paint

306
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,640
 off so the brick can get worked on again so it's just a nightmare if you actually do paint

307
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,680
 your bricks incorrectly jason we knew about that that's what i'm saying yeah i have painted

308
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,520
 bricks but maybe maybe the dryness will save me in my house i think that's it and it's

309
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,800
 also it's also probably depends on the mixture of the brick and what kind of like these are

310
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:15,120
 like straight up bricky bricks are yours more like uh non-bricky bricks you know no no i'm

311
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,040
 fascinated where this question is about to go i am so curious number one las vegas masonry

312
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,520
 podcast let's roll i don't i just kind of believe there are different kinds of compositions

313
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,980
 of the masonry i am i am so curious what paul what knowledge of bricks paul is about to

314
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,880
 reveal are they and what level of brick knowledge he thinks that i have great are they grade

315
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,360
 a bricks are they grade b so i'm looking for to get some work done on my bricks now these

316
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,520
 are bricky bricks you'll know brickety bricks yeah these are brickety brick brick bricks

317
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:57,880
 uh these ones have the same intelligence as a u.s senator oh my well brickety brick uh

318
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:05,120
 everything about our our house is 1980 it the house looks like the ford tempo that we

319
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,720
 used to own if we still had that ford tempo it would it would even mean you could park

320
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,480
 the ford tempo we used to have right next to our house and it would disappear like camouflage

321
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,560
 you know how uh the the enterprise d has that beige and and uh would sure and oh yeah yeah

322
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,480
 no matt and i were just talking about that earlier the enterprise d with the beigeness

323
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,440
 with the different browns and tans extra dick the different browns and tans so it was a

324
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:45,240
 uh a ford tempo from 80 82 maybe it was a brown ford tempo uh from 82 uh i think brown

325
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,400
 ford yeah around 82 or 84 uh 84 go 84 needs to be a little bit newer than that then i

326
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,520
 love okay so we're for those of you listening we're building up the uh the pictures here

327
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,720
 uh of a brown ford tempo from oh yeah that's that's good and brown yeah it was just like

328
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,760
 your house it was two-tone though like it had the top of it was was light beige and

329
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,000
 the bottom was dark beige and then the seats were beige it was just the beige-iest fucking

330
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,680
 thing and our house is just beige you got a beige house the crazy thing about it too

331
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:28,400
 they just replaced the windows she's a beige house she's mighty bland boring as all get

332
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:37,720
 out she's a beige house no curb appeal at all just making you forget it exists uh yeah

333
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,440
 it is i mean for me personally i could give a shit what the exterior of the house looks

334
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,200
 like because i've made the interior look like at least my basement a vomit of color and

335
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,880
 craziness you know i mean it's it's it's nuts down here uh yeah yeah it's it's it's it's

336
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,160
 special i love it i love it down here it's crazy uh it makes me happy um and and it is

337
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,080
 very a very nondescript home like if you were looking for like a place to just hide forever

338
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,360
 this would be it but uh it's going to be this beautiful cottage blue and whites but they

339
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,840
 when they put the new windows in on the house the windows that they got had a green interior

340
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,280
 trim that was just part of the the build like the it's metal green and it just looks whackadoo

341
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,800
 so anyway we're getting everything fixed up and it's going to be really lovely and the

342
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,640
 fact that this company can fix them windows the fact that this company can fix the brick

343
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,520
 as well makes me really happy because like i said some of it's being held together with

344
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:44,120
 great stuff so there you go yeah well squirrels are being held out with with great stuff i

345
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,360
 yes yes great stuff single-handedly keeping squirrels out of the mattingly household it's

346
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,280
 keeping something out it's keeping some stuff out yeah uh latter-day scoop says my basement

347
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,400
 is the suburb equivalent of stabbing a person in the attic just to see color i i or the

348
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:08,160
 arctic just to see color oh yes okay yes then that makes more sense uh yeah kind of yeah

349
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,640
 i drive along i pull up to my every time i go up into my attic i go completely colorblind

350
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,880
 it's terrible i do pull up to my very nondescript uh drive and then i open the basement door

351
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,080
 and then i just hit with a flood of color and also in the chat canna clumsy knows what's

352
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,080
 up because that dog ain't no dog that's three squirrels in a dog costume it's a heist oh

353
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,320
 yeah it's a heist it's a heist it could be could be if only we could get in but there's

354
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,480
 so much great stuff i'm i'm seeing some some faces in the chat here that they're going

355
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,720
 to get thank you videos uh from my son uh uh but uh it's that time of year for my son

356
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,520
 makes adorable thank you videos if you donate to him this year the theme is uh if he wins

357
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,080
 his donation contest he gets a big annoying beach ball that'll be in the house to annoy

358
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,480
 his mother so he's putting out videos that says help me annoy my mom and you can donate

359
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,600
 to it and scoops party stepped up but uh but but but do do step up and uh and if you want

360
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,840
 i'll the link is on my instagram if you go to my noodler and click on my links it says

361
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,920
 donate to my kid's school but you can see the uh it's weirdly not on your wife's social

362
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:18,240
 media at all it's almost like she doesn't want it to happen so uh public schools still

363
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,880
 need a little extra funding believe it or not yeah no i don't i can't i can't imagine

364
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:31,520
 you kid me he is he is like 150 bucks out of the top 10 so oh uh he's he's close to

365
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,640
 getting some real real recognition there but that's fantastic good for him does he get

366
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,440
 a prize if he if he finishes in the top 10 i think he has extra like some some doodad

367
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,600
 bullshit sticker he gets to graduate eighth grade yeah look they'll they'll make him stand

368
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,680
 up at the graduation or something yeah oh spirit of the funding drive let's go spirit

369
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,640
 of the candy bars spirit of the candy bars man that i am the spirit of the candy bars

370
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:03,080
 spirit of the funding drive uh jacob bring our buddy jobeth in here for a minute here

371
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,200
 that's that's fine jobeth here yeah well you go ahead and talk i'll bring you up jobeth

372
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,720
 is uh gonna take his show to spain and so he's trying to uh crowdfund that effort and

373
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,160
 uh he was he reached out to me to say if you could talk about the show i said yes but i

374
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,880
 also wanted to come up with something for the scoops to put on his kickstarter and so

375
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:35,840
 aha oh great um he he uh he's going to announce what that what that is um when you find him

376
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,520
 jacob jesus jobeth start talking i can't find oh you need me to start talking so you can

377
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,360
 find me i'm sorry i thought matt just picked up on it and started running with it there

378
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,840
 it is i wanted both of you oh there you are i found you awesome so yeah i um producing

379
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,600
 i was like i can't find him in the fucking zoom thing i don't know from times being in

380
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,080
 the churn and otherwise uh past handful of years i have kind of shifted lanes a little

381
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,480
 bit into doing hypnosis shows instead of the normal mentalism that i was doing before and

382
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,720
 it's it's kind of really blown up and it's taking me all over the place so yeah i got

383
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,040
 an invitation to go and participate in this year's 2025 barcelona fringe festival in

384
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,920
 barcelona spain which is oh barcelona exciting and we're uh i'm dragging my wife along we're

385
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,080
 making a big adventure out of it so we're gonna end up hitting a couple different european

386
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,920
 countries on the way there um but i'm looking to really build exposure with this thing so

387
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:41,400
 the the purpose of the kickstarter they all look like they're there to raise money which

388
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,760
 is which is great and there's some fun perks and we'll talk about some of those that per

389
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,480
 matt's suggestion which i think is fantastic and i would love to do um some specific add-ons

390
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,840
 for the scoops really i'm trying to get this thing to hit so it you know it triggers the

391
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:04,480
 algorithm and i get more of a a global exposure for this thing because it's if anybody's ever

392
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,960
 performed at a fringe festival and i know that some of the scoops have and i think i

393
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,280
 mean matt you did the one in uh fallout fringe recently it's one of the best investments

394
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,840
 an artist can make it's just it's just it's just a license to print money it really is

395
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:27,080
 uh wait you had a decidedly different experience than than i did um almost every fringe festival

396
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:33,760
 in the language is like hey we will not let you make a profit like it's almost guaranteed

397
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,600
 it's almost guaranteed so like you can you can ask to break even at best there's usually

398
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:45,360
 language in the application that says that so before i decided to launch this kickstarter

399
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,120
 i talked to my wife into coming with me and i said exactly that in some version of that

400
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,600
 said there's the best that you can hope to do is break even we're going to make a vacation

401
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,800
 out of this that i happen to be doing a run of shows that way nobody's mad about the money

402
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,840
 yeah that's all but i want the exposure i want full rooms my shows are far more fun

403
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,640
 with a lot more people in the room and it's a really different type of show because usually

404
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,200
 hypnotists they do their thing bring people up get whoever they can into trance and then

405
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,560
 they've got this script of routines that they go through of the silly shit that they make

406
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:28,680
 people do i am doing a show where as audience members enter the theater they are prompted

407
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,040
 to put down ideas for stuff that they want to see in the show and i'm going to write

408
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,640
 the show basically on the fly there there's going to be some cheating involved with respect

409
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,000
 to the kickstarter so if you are interested in the kickstarter and i thought you meant

410
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,560
 you were going to fuck other people's spouses um just right there on stage if they wrote

411
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:57,520
 on the paper it's on the paper fuck my wife the kickstarter will give people a chance

412
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,800
 to suggest routines that i'll bring with me and drop into the bucket nice as potential

413
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,440
 things so ultimately again i want these full rooms the full rooms one of my real call to

414
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,000
 action here is less about funding the kickstarter more about because right now it's in pre-launch

415
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,200
 okay everything is at carnivalofdreams.com so that's the name of the show and again the

416
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,780
 audience i'll throw that in the zoom chat for people who are there if people can jump

417
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,240
 on and follow this thing because the the follows that you get in pre-launch are also part of

418
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,160
 triggering the algorithm and getting it exposure i'm trying to put as much of the full court

419
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,280
 press on this thing as i can thank you jacob um and but there is some cool stuff so for

420
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,680
 as little as five bucks people can join a private whatsapp group where i'm going to

421
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,880
 be giving updates throughout and everything up to getting swag from it suggesting routines

422
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,040
 everything's got a price so if you want it to be guaranteed that i use your routine in

423
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,640
 the show there is a level where you and i will hop on the zoom call before this thing

424
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,120
 and actually plan out and write a routine so you know what you're getting i video all

425
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,520
 the shows so there's one of the levels that you can get video of all of the shows from

426
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,760
 it and for the scoops since i'm going to be in europe and in three european cities there

427
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,800
 will be an add-on there that will make sense to almost nobody other than you all where

428
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:36,640
 i will yell salt pork in front of some sort of famous monument somewhere in either berlin

429
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,920
 paris or barcelona and you know you don't even have to put hey scoops at checkout you'll

430
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,720
 know exactly what it is it actually even says that you don't have to put hey scoops at checkout

431
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,400
 i don't even know if there's promo codes on get started i've backed so many damn projects

432
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,520
 whether they are magic related or other weird tech stuff and like the number of decks of

433
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,740
 playing cards that i have that sean farquhar has designed i could probably build a house

434
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:10,480
 with them but um yeah i'm sure you see that with the foam that paul used to keep the mice

435
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,400
 out of the basement right a little great stuff goes a long way otherwise three squirrels

436
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:23,760
 at a trench coat will steal it yes so i i thought it was really funny to have jobeth

437
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,520
 yelling uh salt pork out loud to different at different different monuments and stuff

438
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,840
 around europe oh wait are you going to yell the are you going to yell salt pork in front

439
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,160
 of the monuments or are you going to yell salt pork at the monuments as the monuments

440
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,080
 have done something to deserve being yelled at dealer's choice and if for anybody who's

441
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,200
 back to kickstarter before you know that once it funds once you get the submission and everything

442
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,740
 there'll be some back and forth and and you know i've been a member of this community

443
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:02,080
 since i brought matt to elkton to really kick off us having the elkton magic shows and i

444
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,440
 kind of backdoor obelisk myself because of wanting to kind of do some research for a

445
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,080
 second i thought you were going to tell a fun story about you and matt in the early

446
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,480
 days hey oh um i mean there's plenty of plenty of fun stories it was very similar wolfman's

447
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:27,160
 appearance on fools very similar so um you know the the the scopes i i don't know that

448
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,440
 i feel like i quote owe a lot to them but i i certainly owe a lot of enjoyment to everything

449
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,400
 that is here so the amount of levity that's going to exist in you sending me a message

450
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,360
 saying can you do specifically this consider it done um again the following job that came

451
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,920
 with an idea for abracadabra and maybe other people on here might like that one too okay

452
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,640
 same thing only you hold up a rubik's cube and you go you know there's one and 43 quadrillion

453
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,720
 combinations of things on a rubik's cube did you know that and then i'll pan to my wife

454
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:10,200
 and she can do rj sigh so for those listening it's my biggest pet peeve with every magician

455
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,560
 has dumb pet peeves and mine is that anytime anyone does a rubik's cube trick they say

456
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,440
 there are over 43 quadrillion combinations you can do with rubik's cube and i just think

457
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,160
 like that's true i agree but do you want me the audience member to think that you the

458
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,840
 magician knows 43 quadrillion combinations because that's obnoxious that's obnoxious

459
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,920
 if you want me to think you're that much of a math whiz but also yeah you know are going

460
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,320
 to find my eight of hearts later like it just seems like a really weird thing to add to

461
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:48,720
 a show you are the smartest person i've ever seen and you're doing rubik's cube magic exactly

462
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:56,960
 exactly this is perfect jobith i've got a question for you absolutely the shows in spain

463
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,840
 are they going to be done in english or are you learning them in spanish uh they are going

464
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:08,840
 to be done in english so that area in barcelona apparently has a a thriving english comedy

00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,600
 scene okay which is which was what became the birth of this fringe festival there this

466
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,400

570
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
 they were playing it at the south point here in las vegas

571
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
 so i wouldn't saw tim curry and martin mall do clue

572
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
 so i wouldn't saw tim curry and martin mall do clue

573

 flames, flames at the side of my face

575
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
 madeline kahn

576
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,160
 when she enters the movie for the first time

577
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
 i started laughing instantly

578
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,160
 holy shit

579
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
 i love madeline kahn so much

580
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
 she's so good in that movie

581
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,160
 and they did the thing

582
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
 they did the thing like the original one

583
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
 where they didn't show all the endings

584
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
 oh they just showed one

585
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
 they picked one ending and showed that

586
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
 because that's how they did it when the movie first came out

587
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
 that's right

588
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
 to show all the different theaters had just one ending

589
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
 and then i think comedy central started

590
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
 i think they're the ones who did

591
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
 all the endings together

592
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
 when comedy central started re-airing the movie

593
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
 i think they did it on the

594
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
 vhs, the vhs release had all the endings

595
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
 oh is that what it is? yeah

596
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,160
 the vhs went and maybe it went like this

597
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
 and maybe it went like this

598
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
 oh so comedy central showed that part

599
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
 yes and i think

600
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
 that kind of inspired

601
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,160
 waynes world

602
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
 oh yeah that makes sense

603
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,160
 first waynes world had multiple endings

604
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
 but yeah it was so good

605
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
 matt what were you going to ask?

606
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160

 there was a group behind me

618
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
 who was just saying out loud

619
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
 every single punchline

620
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
 before it happened

621
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,160
 oh that's so annoying

622
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
 it didn't bother me that much

623
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
 because i knew all of them too

624
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,160
 so i was also

625
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
 oh yeah these are coming

626
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
 do you think this is an effect of

627
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
 it being a tim curry movie

628
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,160
 kind of just vibing on that

629
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,160
 rocky vibe

630
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,160
 yeah i think so i think they were just

631
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
 having a good time i wasn't mad at them

632
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
 but they were doing a lot i was also sitting

633
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,160
 next to a uh

634
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,160
 i don't know you know me i can't tell how

635
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,160
 old kids are but it was a little girl

636
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
 she seemed to be like i don't know 12

637
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,160
 maybe 12 13 something like that

638
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,160
 and uh it is

639
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,160
 really great sitting next to

640
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
 someone at a movie that you

641
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,160
 love and as

642
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
 you're watching it you realize how

643
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
 formative it was to you especially

644
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
 to uh to your comedy

645
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
 oh yeah as you're as you're watching it

646
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
 and you're sitting next to

647
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
 a preteen little girl

648
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
 who is

649
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
 so unimpressed with everything

650
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
 the screen might

651
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
 as well be blank

652
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
 it was so

653
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
 great it was it made my

654
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160

657
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
 really it was like just sitting

658
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
 there you could tell every reference to it

659
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
 because there are it's a it's a more

660
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,160
 dated movie than you think it is there are

661
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
 a few sure references in there that

662
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
 you're like i if you don't if you don't

663
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160

664
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
 hoover

665
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,160
 is on the phone at one point jager

666
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
 hoover is on is on the phone at one point

667
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
 and somebody makes the the comment

668
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
 uh tim curry makes the comedies like he's

669
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,160
 on everybody else's phone why shouldn't he be on mine

670
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,160
 right right right right

671
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
 that's a funny jager hoover

672
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,160
 running the fbi joke right

673
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
 that is not applicable in twenty

674
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
 twenty-five and uh uh

675
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
 now how old is this individual

676
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
 oh the the kid was like twelve

677
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
 or thirteen oh okay so yeah no no

678
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
 no no no she was just i was like

679
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,160
 why did your parents bring you to this

680
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,160
 you clearly hate all of this

681
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
 well and it's also just a factor

682
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,160
 of movies were a little bit

683
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
 more slow paced

684
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,160
 back in the lower yeah so

685
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,160
 you know that's hard to

686
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,160
 it's hard to shift that brain especially at

687
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,160
 thirteen my god i get it yeah

688
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
 i get it

689
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,160
 you forget that the whole mr

690
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,160
 body's a real acting flex you

691
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
 totally forget there's a big build up before

692
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
 before the murder happens

693
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,160
 and mr body has

694
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
 to be like i'm the greatest actor in

695
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,160
 the world i'm the biggest

696
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
 he has to come in

697
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
 it's like the only actor in the movie you

698
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
 don't know who it is yeah

699
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
 exactly and he has to come in and just

700
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
 try his damnedest to take

701
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
 it over while tim curry is on the

702
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
 other side of the room just being

703
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
 tim curry exactly

704
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
 exactly so yeah you just feel

705
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
 terrible for this guy i watched it again

706
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
 that's it i was like i watched it again

707
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
 like uh like four years ago or something i was like oh

708
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,160
 i forgot this guy really tries to

709
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,160
 throw a flamethrower it just really

710
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
 isn't happening

711
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
 it really comes across as a big

712
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
 failure

713
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,160
 yeah it's just poor guy

714
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
 he's just trying

715
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
 uh yeah when i was younger

716
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
 i did not appreciate i did not

717
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
 comedically understand how subtle and awesome

718
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
 martin mull was being so we were watching it as an adult

719
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,160
 he's so funny

720
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
 it's like it's so subtle and he's such a

721
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
 groveler like it's so great

722
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
 his looks are great uh

723
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,160
 he keeps on like

724
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
 touching mrs scarlet

725
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,160
 in just vaguely inappropriate

726
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
 ways and she just keeps on

727
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
 being annoyed by it and shooting

728
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,160
 him looks or hitting him or something

729
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,160
 and nobody ever acknowledges it

730
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,160
 no i was just a little too young

731
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160

 daughter is what animal they would like to put a saddle

765
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,160
 on and ride around i told them that

766
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
 i would put a saddle on a hippo because

767
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,160
 they are spectacular plus the land

768
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
 and water speed and maneuverability

769
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,160

 sektars do you not remember sektars

803
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
 jacob no matt do you remember

804
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,160
 sektars i don't

805
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,160
 so sektars how many times can

806
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,160
 paul say the word sektars

807
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,160
 sektars is a toy line i know what it is

808
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,160
 before he decides that we don't it was

809
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
 a little expensive the figures were

810
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,160
 a little closer to seven inches they were

811
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,160
 pretty tall and they would ride on

812
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,160
 the backs of giant bugs

813
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
 and the bugs were the big feature

814
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,160
 of the toy line so the bugs

815
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,160
 had these big wings that you could manipulate but the

816
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
 cool thing was they were

817
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,160
 puppets you put your hand

818
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
 into the bug and

819
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,160
 your hand became the bugs

820
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
 legs

821
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,160
 oh yeah i do remember that

822
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
 of course you do because sektars were fucking

823
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,160
 cool and so you would fly

824
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,160
 you would fly them around and they'd be riding on your back

825
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,160
 and they had a huge playset

826
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,160
 their playset was

827
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,160
 ginormous the sektar

828
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,160
 it looked like just a

829
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,160
 chasm wall

830
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,160
 it was really cool but yeah

831
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,160
 sektars

832
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,160
 would fly around and they're redoing

833
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
 sektars now

834
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160

835
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160

853
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,160
 sektar don't sound like any toy line i ever heard of

861
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,160
 that's what sektar translates into

862
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,160
 i just found out in the chat you can ride inside a train

863
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
 that was really

864
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
 what a waste of time

865
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
 so silly

866
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160

00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
 hippo is a good idea hippo is a

869
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
 solid rideable animal

870
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
 it's tough to ride

871
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
 get your legs all spread way out

872
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,160
 well you can do some kind of saddle

873
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,160
 situations kind of seat situation

874
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,160

875
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,160

876
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,160

 i think either a linebacker or a defensive

1002
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,160
 lineman uh he's really into horses

1003
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,160
 and he has horses he rides

1004
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,160
 horses and so they take the cameras out

1005
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,160
 watching a huge professional athlete

1006
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,160
 on the back of an equally

1007
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,160
 huge because he has like very

1008
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,160
 large horses to accommodate

1013
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,160
 of a horse and no matter how big that horse

01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,160
 was the shortest player to start in the

1179
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,160
 nba oh

1180
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,160
 it's either spudweb or muggsy

1181
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,160
 bogues oh i forgot

1182
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,160
 about muggsy bogues

1183
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,160
 it's gotta be spudweb

1184
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
 alright

1185
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,160
 muggsy bogues

1186
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:11,160
 y'all were both so confident on it

1187
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,160
 i was sitting over here thinking like

1188
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,160
 i think it's muggsy but y'all were both so

1189
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,160
 confident that it was spud that you convinced

1190
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,160
 me

1191
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,160
 i'll try small facts

1192
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,160
 for 800

1193
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,160
 england's shortest adult

1194
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,160
 monarch was charles the first who was

1195
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,160
 estimated to be five foot four at the start

1196
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,160
 of his reign approximately

1197
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,160
 how tall was he by the end of his reign

1198
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,160
 i'd say approximately

1199
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
 five foot four

1200
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,160
 probably lost his head right

1201
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,160
 is that what they're doing they're taking into

1202
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,160
 consideration he's like six inches

1203
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,160
 shorter because he got his head cut off or something

1204
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,160
 oh yeah so yeah i'll say he's

1205
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,160
 approximately one head shorter

1206
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,160
 approximately four uh four eight because

1207
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,160
 his head was chopped off any answer

1208
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,160
 gets credit yeah great just like what happened

1209
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,160
 with muggsy bogues

1210
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,160
 just like what happened

1211
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,160
 he would have been a much taller basketball player

1212
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,160
 yeah if he had kept

1213
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,160
 his head if he had kept his head

1214
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,160

 prior to becoming a wrestling star

01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,160
 he played bass for the band ruckus

1218
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,160
 presumably before

1219
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,160

1302
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,160

 now it's the

1304
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,160
 daily double of the day

1305
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,160
 still for 400

1306
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
 two ounces of bourbon

1307
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,160
 three ounces of lemon juice

1308
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,160
 one half ounce simple syrup

1309
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,160
 one egg white shaken with ice

1310
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,160
 and strained into a rocks glass or

1311
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,160
 coupe

1312
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,160
 interesting is this a proper

1313
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,160
 this is

1314
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,160
 i used to make this drink all the time

1315
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,160
 it's in

1316
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,160
 my old old cocktail book

1317
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,160
 that i have on my bar and i don't remember

1318
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,160
 the name of it

1319
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,160
 it's not like the first recipe of an original like old fashioned

1320
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,160
 i don't think so

1321
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,160
 because the egg white in there

1322
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,160
 throws that off

1323
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,160
 uh

1324
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,160
 what is a kentucky omelette

1325
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,160
 show me kentucky

1326
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,160
 omelette

1327
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,160
 a whiskey sour

1328
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,160
 whiskey sour

1329
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,160
 that's not what i was thinking of at all

1330
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,160
 i'm dumb

1331
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,160
 but the egg white

1332
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
 i don't get the egg white in there

1333
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,160
 the original recipe is called for egg white

1334
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,160
 because it gave like a froth on the top

1335
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,160
 when you shook it in the cocktail shaker

1336
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,160
 that's true

1337
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,160
 i'll close out cocktails for 200

1338
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,160
 oh shit it's the other daily double

1339
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,160

1340
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,160

1341
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,160
 one cube

1342
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,160
 of sugar muddled with

1343
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,160
 i never know how to say that word bitters

 stir with ice strain into a rocks glass

1349
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,160

01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,160
 abundant gas in earth's atmosphere

1365
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,160
 farts

1366
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,160
 nitrogen

1367
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,160
 nitrogen

1368
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,160
 is incorrect

1369
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,160
 oxygen is number one

1370
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,160
 nitrogen is number one

1371
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,160
 fart

1372
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,160
 matt

1373
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
 i was told it was hydrogen that's why i never lit any canvas

1374
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
 good idea

1375
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,160
 smart play it safe

1376
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,160
 stay in the dark

1377
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,160
 i will do second biggest facts

1378
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,160
 for 600

1379
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
 second largest country

1380
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
 in the world by area

1381
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
 causing all kinds of hysteria

1382
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:57,160
 this is the worst

1383
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,160
 beastie boys song ever

1384
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
 land maps

1385
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,160
 let's do it

1386
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,160
 i don't know

1387
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,160
 there's a move

1388
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,160
 a group right now trying to advocate

1389
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,160
 for more accurate maps

1390
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,160
 because africa the way we show on maps

1391
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,160
 is basically too small

1392
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,160
 so they're trying to like

1393
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,160
 create a different map so that we show how large africa is

1394
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,160
 yes

1395
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,160
 that's been a movement

1396
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,160
 for a while

1397
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,160
 i think it's worth dedicating your life to

1398
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,160
 i don't know

1399
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,160
 pass

1400
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,160
 oh that passes to me

1401
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:39,160
 yeah i mean it's gotta be

1402
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,160
 second largest country

1403
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,160
 by area

1404
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,160
 oh i've got points i can play around a little bit

1405
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,160
 so russia's real big

1406
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,160
 china's real big

1407
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:53,160
 this isn't gonna be one of those where like

1408
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,160
 because the maps are drawn

1409
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,160
 drawn wrong

1410
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
 it's like greenland or something

1411
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,160
 no i don't know

1412
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
 so russia or china

1413
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,160
 i would think so one of those

1414
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,160
 it's gotta be

1415
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,160
 i think russia is

1416
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,160
 smaller than china's i'll say russia

1417
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,160
 canada

1418
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,160
 blame canada

1419
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,160
 i will

1420
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,160
 canada is number two

1421
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,160
 russia is number one with 6.6 million

1422
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,160
 oh miles

1423
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,160
 square miles i guess

1424
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,160
