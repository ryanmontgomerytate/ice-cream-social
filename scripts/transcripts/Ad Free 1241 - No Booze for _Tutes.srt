19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,680
 know people yeah been to Bucky's love of Bucky's and it's it's I think it's

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
 expanding or has expanded to Louisiana as well all I know is that when I was

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,800
 performing as hillbill I put my baseball cards into a Bucky's bag and put that out

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 with a fishing pole and people really laughed at the Bucky's people love the

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,160
 Bucky's bag yeah that makes sense that makes sense Bucky's for people who don't

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,820
 know is the biggest truck stop you've ever seen in your life but it's not for

25
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,920
 truckers it's just for you know regular Joe's driving their little Toyota Corolla's

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,320
 up and down the street yeah so it's ridiculous yeah they've got smokers

27
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,160
 they've got smoke shops you can go in there yeah it's all crazy I think there's

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 one supposed to open it near Las Vegas or like on the way to Las Vegas or

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
 something like that a lot of day scoop in the chat right now is saying supposed

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,960
 to be getting a Bucky's in Utah yeah maybe that's it yeah can't be Utah's

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,880
 ahead of Nevada on the Bucky's list man but that hurts that hurts my feelings I

32
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,800
 feel like you know we don't we don't have the the lottery we don't have

33
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,260
 Bucky's I feel like 20 years from now we're gonna be dealing with Bucky's like

34
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,120
 the Walmart situation like how there are no more gas stations there's just

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,840
 Bucky's it's just Bucky's yeah mm-hmm yeah oh yeah no yeah for sure oh and

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,480
 Leon Kasab is pointing out in the chat too that they are they're big Christian

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:39,600
 no big Christian activists as well yeah it's it's tough it's tough no I guess

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,560
 we'll just go to in and out or Domino's instead yeah you'll be fine we got we

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,960
 got a sheet slash wah-wah locked down out here in PA so ain't nobody coming for

40
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,880
 sheets and wah-wah I don't think holy sheets oh why the why the sheets not

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:05,080

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:13,200
 hey hey you want to get 10 tacos for 699 why the sheets not that's terrible

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,760

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,880
 called nuggets chicken nuggets are called schnuggets cuz that's fine but

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,200
 yeah everything's why the schnuggets makes more sense than why the sheets not

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,960
 schnuggets approved schnuggets approved no problem I'm fine with schnuggets you

47

55
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,760
 thing I do not suffer from is constipation that has never been an issue

56
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,440
 in my life ever ever Paul's Native American name is flowing river it's

57
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,560

58
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:58,880
 schnuggets I haven't eaten a long time haven't eaten it sheets a long time but

59
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:10,560
 I will tell you this I was betrayed by value gentlemen oh yes so we went we

60
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,320
 went last week to to Aldi do you guys have Aldi now in Vegas we just got it

61
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,120
 yeah right I haven't been yet but we and I grew up I grew up with an all day

62
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,040
 around me in Jersey okay so I really like Aldi our Aldi is good got some

63
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:34,900
 really great stuff and brother the value just stacks so we're going long and I'm

64
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,800
 grabbing some grub here and there picking out a few things and all these

65
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,640
 one of these places where you can put in a quarter into the bass cart and get a

66
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,240
 bass cart and rent the bass cart what it you just said bass cart three times what

67
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,000
 the fuck is a bass cart so I grew up calling them carts yeah Buggies I see I

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,200
 never call them Buggies they're called no I called them Buggies they call them

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,520
 Buggies out here okay I always called them carts or baskets yeah that's fine

70
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,560
 no they people out here don't know what the hell you're saying when you say

71
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,440
 bass cart no and people like I think I have that with the sheets with that was

72
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
 a snuggies independent film that came out in the 90s about that artist who

73
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,440
 drew with like maple syrup on his placemat you know what he was great my

74
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,840
 dad was a my dad was a grocery man I'm gonna say bass cart is probably insider

75
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,840
 terminology that I inherited oh I bet you it is yeah gotta be I bet you

76
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,960
 anything because he would you know I just I always called it a bass cart

77
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:52,560
 anyway so actually when I go shopping I don't deal with any of that okay I get

78
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,640
 on like a mechanic sled and I lie on my back and I walk around with like an

79
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,200
 Easter basket on my belly and I just shopped that way I just reach I back

80
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,800
 around I move around the store that's like that old Richard Simmons thing

81
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
 right of like only search shop in certain spots in the grocery store and

82
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,120
 this is the way to do it you get on your belly on the bound oh yeah only stuff

83
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,920
 you can reach from your from laying down that's the only stuff that's safe to eat

84
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,000
 anymore yeah so anyway I don't think I've ever heard the term bass cart

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,400
 before well but yet regional term particularly used in the Pacific

86
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,480
 Northwest and other areas for shopping cart or grocery cart I but it's for the

87
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,600
 smaller one right you're talking about no this is just saying the the big one

88
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,000
 the regular size was bass cart because I was accepting the notion that it was an

89
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,080
 insider for a different kind of cart right so you get the regular shopping

90
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,040
 carts and you get together get the bass carts too I know it's talking about say

91
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:00,600
 in my brain I always just conflated it to being it's a cart that has a wire

92
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,800
 basket on it mm-hmm right that was what that was why it was a bass cart that's

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,840
 that's what it looks like here on the of the old Google yeah so anyway nobody out

94
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,600
 here stealing carts or what about what about what about tiscots or tascots is

95
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,200
 anyone stealing those out there yes the blue and yellow ones specifically are

96
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,680
 gone you cannot what about my virtue someone stole it a long time ago and I've

97
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,800
 been looking for it ever since you're not gonna find it you're not gonna find

98
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,840
 it at Aldi pal what about my my pearls has anyone stole my pearls god damn you

99
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,000
 know I think I'm gonna try and incorporate that bit but I think it's

100
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,280
 gonna become more common because our power grid is gonna start failing a lot

101
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:54,680
 more often so anyway you don't have to take a cart at Aldi ah bass cart

102
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,520
 latter-day scoop we have a picture there it is shopping cart filled with bass

103
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:06,360
 well done bass cart for sure good job so well done well you know you don't have

104
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,800
 to bring a cart you can just bring your bag okay reusable bag and stick it in

105
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,320
 there and then take that to the checkout line and stick it back in the bag which

106
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,640
 what I usually do is I don't shop a ton of stuff very rarely do I use a cart you

107
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,680
 can also just grab they leave boxes in the front so you just grab a box oh yeah

108
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,720
 yeah from the product and throw stuff in a box check out and you're you know kind

109
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,560
 of eco-friendly save some time it's nice I like it and also people forget their

110
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,440
 quarter sometime and can't rent a cart so they just need to carry a box anyway

111
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,360
 we're shopping around and I'm like ooh it's hot dog time there's hot dogs so I

112
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,640
 grab some hot dogs and I'm looking at the hot dogs and they're like you know what

113
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,920
 time it is it's hot dog time hot dogs are maybe maybe three bucks maybe all

114
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,200
 right great good and then I look a fair price for a hot dog and right neck well

115
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,160
 for eight hot dogs I look right next to these hot dogs and there's another pack

116
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,500
 of hot dogs that aren't an Aldi in-house brand what how much how low would you go

117
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,560
 on a pack you've already gone below the number that I would once I see $3 hot

118
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,920
 dogs I go nope I'm done these these I believe the I believe the Aldi hot dogs

119
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,400
 I believe they were priced at a point where if you took those up to the cash

120
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,280
 year the cashier would turn around and give you three dollars along with the

121
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,840
 pack of hot well they should have these these boys paper these boys were 89

122
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:54,480
 cents so I was like Mike Neal said in the chat you guessed 99 cents you went

123
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
 over my friend I was like you're out according to Price is Right rules I got

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,680
 to try this I got to see what's up 89 cents let's go for how many any cheap any

125
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:13,520
 cheek just yum eight wieners 89 cents so a dime and change per hot dog yeah I

126
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,660
 swear to God I'm gonna get diarrhea listening to this Leon is sending the

127
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:26,040
 right gift so uh poor Lindsey so he said sexy Barry White don't don't come in

128
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,480
 with 11 cents like my 10 cents and change wasn't good enough math that's

129
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,320
 it's a change so I or 11 cents I had those in the fridge for a while we hadn't

130
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,160
 I hadn't gotten to crack them open yet and today yesterday it's the first of

131
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,120
 the month time time for the doggies to get their medicine great and the doggies

132
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,600
 like their medicine for the most part but one Billy Bones does not like his

133
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,720
 heart tick flea worm combo and he only likes his heart-tickin fleas he only

134
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,800
 takes it with hot dogs so we're like okay well I got these hot dogs what

135
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,280
 better way to test them than with the doggies so I crack them open I put a

136
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,440
 couple in the microwave and a sense vomit on it comes walk this way a smell

137
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:26,040
 like we have never experienced comes filling filling that cost exactly 10

138
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,680
 cents and change yeah and you put it in the microwave oh that's the only way I

139
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:40,640
 cook my wieners that's so gross you are a monster you are a monster person the

140
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:49,940
 only way I cook my hot dogs is microwave so the smell has infiltrated the home

141
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,240
 it's really it's really rough scooper Nova girl and say you are eight years

142
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,960
 old scooper Nova girl you are overestimate you're guessing hi so when

143
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,520
 you when you bought those hot dogs they're like the savings come with their

144
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:16,280
 own cost there was a monkey's paw yeah storm clouds rolled in as you got into

145
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:27,840
 your car well when I did it and gave me a look was like okay and I found this

146
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,680
 pack of hot dogs there were three dollars and something hot dogs oh my god

147
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,640
 what are we gonna do the two dollars and eleven cents we saved from buying

148
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,760
 regular hot dogs well and I'd say well about part of a comic book that's

149
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,000
 basically it next to these three dollar packs of hot dogs though there was a man

150
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,040

172
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,440

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,480

184
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,560
 the hot dog in the microwave it's a meat skin issue yes what's it what you don't

185
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,800
 like what happens on the tech you're seeing should be crispy well it gets

186
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,080
 crispy sometimes no that's impossible in the microwave nope you're lying to

187
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,400
 yourself but you're talking to a guy who loves the texture of pudding skin so

188
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,040
 that's kind of what I've got with the microwave wiener if that's your level

189
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:32,640
 of crunch I want to bite into a hot dog with crunch gross you're a Nathan's guy

196
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,120

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,960
 people celebrating the victory of selling those hot dogs and getting the

228
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,240
 permeate an American household here's the thing and my investigative journalist

229
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,600
 wife and we're going to collapse them from within she quickly she quickly

230
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,240
 while she sat on the couch many feet away from the kitchen smelling the

231
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,880
 death end trails she went ahead and jumped online to find out what is going

232
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,160
 on with these wieners and she found a reddit a reddit thread apparently they

233
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,120
 changed the recipe on these just like two months ago all right everybody is

234
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,440
 like dear god what is this this is not a hot dog this is the

235
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,880
 smelling it is the nastiest thing people were like I've been buying these for a

236
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,520
 long time now they're really disgusting we looked on the ingredients there were

237
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,360
 all these weird our hot dogs will fly a plane right into your taste buds they

238
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,720
 really did the secret ingredient is cat shit says fro-yog and he's right it was

239
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,520
 nasty there's all like cumin and lots of powders and I don't I don't know like

240
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,600
 for a while it was like chicken and beef for the top ingredients they're not

241
00:23:48,600 --> 00:24:03,480
 anymore oh god yes he looked at the ingredients after he was done yeah well

242
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,880
 I didn't eat any well and dared me to eat a little bite night a little bite

243
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,320
 it was so nasty when was the last time you purchased something from a grocery

244
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,400
 store that your wife then had to dare you to eat or cause her to me they get

245
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,640
 on reddit to figure out what was going on when I've been into it I chewed up a

246
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:35,040
 little bit it was like it's like kind of like a falafel meat if it had been on a

247
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,960
 New York sidewalk for a couple days like a gyro you mean yeah like a gyro but

248
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:47,400
 like really like I'm like somebody stepped on this here gyro this big cut

249
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,800
 like the gyros that would come with it would just be like the weird gray meat

250
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,560
 you never you never quite knew where it came from yes yes yeah yeah yeah just a

251
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:03,240
 rotating pile of something yeah so it was it was bad and and she was looking up

252
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,280
 all these different people saying oh god these these hot dogs just are are the

253
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,600
 nastiest thing I've ever eaten this is gross I don't know what's going on with

254
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,200
 this and then the kicker was she looked on the on the bag to find out what the

255
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,300
 branding and everything it's an all the in-house thing but she saw on the

256
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:34,760
 packaging it says explicitly do not recycle this plastic I've seen labels

257
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,680
 that says hey this plastic is not recyclable no but this one was like

258
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:52,400
 warning what did it say why I can tell you my theory okay it's contaminated

259
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:04,360
 there's something horribly wrong with it oh anyway it was really gross it was

260
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:12,400
 really really bad oh I just did a search on our new Aldi hot dogs good is oh yeah

261
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:20,920
 search that okay yeah one of the lines is people have had experience with bad

262
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,240
 experiences with recent quality issues like the hot dogs being too greasy okay

263
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:37,180
 too small okay or leaking what a horrible adjective leaking the hot dogs

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:14,920
 check out you put those bananas lambskin condoms crispy I wouldn't saw the Wizard

301
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,800
 of Oz at the sphere last night we should have been sled with that we

302
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:26,040
 shouldn't talked about hot dogs for the a block you know what you know what I

303
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:33,240
 just gave you 20 minutes of gold from a fucking rotten pig's asshole shut up

304
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,560
 liquid fire shit gold is what you gave me make Wizard of Oz the a block but

305
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:46,240
 then we fell into this pile of gold and I can tell you this Judy Garland doesn't

306
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,280
 microwave up half as nice as an Aldi wiener that is true you take that she's

307
00:30:51,280 --> 00:31:00,800
 real stinky you take that back you'd have to spare as my Judy holy shit the

308
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:08,320
 sphere is still amazing yeah the sphere remains amazing they I I think they

309
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,400
 might have found their thing I think they might have found their thing that's

310
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,040
 gonna make money every day when they don't have concerts in that building

311
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,240
 just reboot movies all right specifically this one this is okay so

312
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,520
 it's so weird so it's not the whole movie they have they have taken the

313
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,240
 movie they have edited out big chunks of it so the whole thing is only like 70

314
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,280
 minutes I think huh I think I think the whole movie about 70 minutes they've

315
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,360
 used you know there's a ton of AI there's a ton of processing there's all

316
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,720
 these things because basically they're taking all the scenes that are zoomed in

317
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,960
 so like if you if you're zoomed in on any M for instance in one scene where

318
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,640
 she's standing in a room talking to people you don't just see her zoomed in

319
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,680
 you see the whole room of filled with filled with like whoever's in the room

320
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,280
 that she's talking to got it so they they took things from the movie they

321
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,680
 took implications from the movie and expanded those out and fleshed those

322
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,560
 out it was really neat a lot of AI stuff a lot of a fit not a lot but a fair

323
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,580
 amount of background characters I don't know how you guys are watching movie and

324
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,840
 TV scenes with big groups of people I find myself always watching the extras I

325
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
 think we've talked about this before Oh no I there are little people I only look

326
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:33,080
 at the stars watch your watch your mouth there there please there no but little

327
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,640
 people is the right thing to say yeah yeah guys eat all the hot dogs you

328
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,400
 fuckers oh no no eat shit it's better for you that's it that's the new curse

329
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,740
 all the hot dogs upon your house Oh God the worst thing your house will be

330
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,240
 uninhabitable it'll smell too bad yeah no I look at background characters in

331
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,440
 fact that's actually my kids will do that too and they actually did over

332
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,400
 their own grandmother and numerous scenes because they realized that back

333
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,120
 when my my mother-in-law was doing a bunch of background work all the time

334
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,520
 right up in the background of some of their favorite shows and she'd forgotten

335
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,080
 she'd done that show or something it's very yeah she had forgotten that she had

336
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,360
 animated herself into spongebob squarepants she was an extra on it so

337
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,720
 this is where they're using you know whatever AI technology CGI technology

338
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,400
 to create you know larger groups that fill the whole screen and stuff like

339
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,960
 that right that's right and they're making a whole new scenes and intro

340
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,560
 scenes like when the when the house lands in Oz instead of just opening like

341
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,520
 in the in the movie Dorothy opens the door to the to the house that just

342
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,440
 landed and she walks out into Oz she walks out into Munchkin land in this

343
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,800
 there's the whole storm scene and by the way they've got you know huge wind

344
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,960
 machines and snow and all kinds of shit falls on you and the chairs vibrate and

345
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,760
 it's the whole 4d experience but on a 20,000 seat scale instead of 100 seat

346
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,900
 scale at the at the fair or whatever so it's really all this stuff they they

347
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:18,480
 start the movie after Dorothy has already interacted with Mrs. Gulch with

348
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,840
 the witch so like they start the movie a good 15 minutes in basically they start

349
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,600
 the movie about two minutes before she's seeing somewhere over the rainbow mm-hmm

350
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,200
 so I mean they just skipped through a lot of stuff but I mean it is it is neat

351
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,320
 and there it was full 20,000 people in there or however many people they have

352
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,200
 is their occupancy for the for the movie stuff well it's already it was like you

353
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,800
 know it's it's doing the number one tourism thing which is people plan trips

354
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,520
 around coming out to see it right and apparently we were talking to a buddy of

355
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,080
 mine who's one of the people who run the show over there he was saying they've

356
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,680
 already sold over 400,000 tickets geez Lord yeah so like they're just yeah I

357
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,760
 mean cuz we went to the show last night that was their that's every Raiders

358
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,360
 that's every Raiders game for the season 400,000 yeah close yeah close to right

359
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,920
 right that ballpark yeah for sure well I'll tell you what's encouraging to me

360
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:22,100
 is seeing is seeing so many of my local friends getting acting work inside yeah

361
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,920
 the theater as extras and sort of like guests and hosts and all that kind of

362
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:34,840
 thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah bunch of people a bunch of people I

363
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,760
 know are working yeah I was like wow like Marcus is there and yeah I saw a

364
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,840
 picture I was like this is just like a who's who of people I've worked with in

365
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:49,200
 the past this is cool yeah yeah so well it eliminates all these other shows and

366
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,440
 jobs nice that they picked up our friends on the way which is good that's

367
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,520
 right well I mean we did talk about that last night we talked about that with with

368
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,480
 a friend of ours James last night he was like oh no one of the guys running the

369
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,360
 show he was like all these great shows in town and we're just selling fuck tons

370
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,320
 of tickets I know it's hurting the other shows in town yeah yeah I was like yeah

371
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,920
 it's true but I mean it's also part of it you know it's it's Vegas goes through

372
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:25,280
 changes and that's the song we all think of when we hear changes and you know

373
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
 like every shows every every casino is never production show right right like

374
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,080
 used to have some kind of big big show that had song song and dance and you'd

375
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,240
 have five every song every casino hired 50 dancers and sure just went away they

376
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,520
 dance on the deco the Titanic while it sank that's right that's when that last

377
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,080
 the longest Jubilee right yeah but but everybody you know even the pen and

378
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,080
 teller theater the Rio used to have a production show in there and that's why

379
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:57,760
 it's like such a big backstage area for Penn and Teller it's because it always

380
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,320
 used to be also they used to also split it with dance with a dance team yeah so

381
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,600
 it's it's you know it is interesting that like you know Cirque du Soleil has

382
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,840
 been open for you know 30 40 years right in this town right and and so you know

383
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,600
 it's interesting that like a literal Death Star got built in the middle of

384
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,900
 the strip and you're like oh no but that's a license they still haven't

385
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,680
 gotten they still haven't been able to just make themselves into the Death Star

386
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,000
 and this is when you're talking about the way you're talking about this very

387
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,720
 experience this this was Star Trek this is Star Trek the experience oh yeah yeah

388
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,240
 especially I mean the dome was what they built you in the I don't know you went

389
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,320
 to that listen motherfucker they built the dome for the original Klingon

390
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,920
 encounter which worked with the this the actual motion ride carts all right the

391
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,400
 vehicles and then when they put in 4d only the ending of that was a theatrical

392
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,200
 4d experience but it had seats that would poke you in the ass and squirt you

393
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,520
 with water and shoot you with air and stuff oh dude I mean it didn't have the

394
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,360
 dick-sucking alien like I would propose we're getting there we're getting there

395
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:22,640
 eventually every day we're a little bit closer to that dick-sucking alien did you

396
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,800
 see it happened at the corn concert did you see it see what specifically there

397
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:39,240
 was a guy at a corn concert up in the up in the nosebleeds jacking it during going

398
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,800
 at it during this is going whole hog turn the show and a bunch of people like

399
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:51,800
 hey dude knock it off and he's like no I'm getting there like he went he went

400
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,400
 to completion on him he didn't give a damn yeah so like the last corn that's

401
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:09,920
 hurt is the second nastiest thing that's been discussed on this show today that is

402
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,400
 horrible so I didn't know I didn't know Lucy K liked corn everybody likes corn

403
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:25,520
 Matt all right they're hard to digest though okay so all right Vegas politics

404
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,360
 and entertainment see change and all that stuff aside yes let's get it what's

405
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,820
 getting the actual experience of going to see Wizard of Oz we get that they

406
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,560
 open the doors I think 45 minutes early so we get there they have decked out

407
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,160
 well they've added a whole bunch of stuff to the lobby so there's all new

408
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,200
 LEDs and all there's a mini sphere in the lobby that people in the zoom chat

409
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,800
 just saw a minute ago so they do all kinds of Wizard of Oz scenes on that

410
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,240
 after the movie is over that's when they do a live performance they do they do

411
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,880
 live performance afterwards you get to like interact with the wizard they've

412
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,920
 got a huge hologram an interactive hologram of the wizard that that appears

413
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,720
 out in the lobby and sorry Jacob breaking news we're getting updates in

414
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,280
 the chat about the guy jerking off with the corn concert turns out people were

415
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,160
 punching him in the back of the head and trying to turn to basically stop him

416
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,720
 they were trying to stop him I don't think they stopped him what they didn't

417
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,800
 realize was featuring out a bug to the guy jacket like he's like he loves a

418
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,680
 good donkey punch he's like oh yeah no don't hit me no

419
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:50,920
 please so much human contact certainly won't put me over the edge so was Darren

420
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,680
 the the wizard when you were there Darren was not the wizard when I was

421
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,720
 there but our friend James Simpson was oh he was the the guard the the you know

422
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,320
 you can't see the wizard nobody sees the wizard not nobody I know how that James

423
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,640
 is the used to work at 50 shades right yes yeah yeah yeah you know James yeah

424
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,200
 he's good guy very good yeah we even got we even got a special little just us

425
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,120
 picture with with James and the wizard in their costumes oh that's awesome yeah

426
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,200
 it's on SJ's phone or I'd show it to you James will James knows everyone

427
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,700
 everyone knows yes yes he is one of those work horses for Vegas that's right

428
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:37,320
 in like every show yes that's right so we were there it is so what I want to

429
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,600
 talk about it's so weird to watch a movie that assumes that everyone has not

430
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,680
 only already seen that movie but that everyone is very familiar with it yeah

431
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,720
 yeah yeah so like like I said earlier like the movie doesn't start with all

432
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,920
 of the setup that the that the real movie starts with it doesn't start with

433
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,160
 you're getting to know the characters it doesn't they're like you know these

434
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,720
 characters we all know that you know these characters we're gonna skip over

435
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,560
 this part we're not gonna have this 20 minutes in the movie where we get to

436
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,200
 know Dorothy and Annie and Uncle Henry and all these people but you don't need

437
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,400
 to know that you know who these people are we're going straight over the

438
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,040
 rainbow she's gonna do the over the rainbow then pretty quickly after that

439
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,360
 we're gonna see Gulch she's gonna be there trying to take the dog dogs gonna

440
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,640
 get away and we're going to Oz so like 10 minutes in their defense we're there

441
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,640
 you have done you have like 80 years to see the original version you know I'm

442
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,240
 not really I'm not criticizing it but it is the first time I've ever seen

443
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,480
 something that assumes that you already know the full story of the thing that

444
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,720
 you're watching well the ruby slippers are still the number one most valuable

445
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,720
 movie prop in existence oh they have to be they are I'd be I'd be surprised if

446
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,880
 anything else was close to it well I think they might get usurped soon possibly

447
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,080
 depends on what I just saw that by what Jacob what do you think is gonna get you

448
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:10,520
 serpent go ahead oh okay I think it'll be the giant robot from Pacific Rim Luke

449
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,680
 Skywalker's lightsaber handle yeah you're closer there Matt yeah it's an

450
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,120
 original screen used Vader lightsaber that is going up for sale yeah Leon

451
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,160
 Casab says that rosebud is the number two most expensive prop yes found in

452
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,160
 the trash that that makes sense too yeah was we don't want to any spoilers for

453
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:38,760
 Citizen Kane to anyone has not yet seen Citizen Kane go ahead fast forward about

454
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,840
 15 seconds while we do all the spoilers for Citizen Kane yeah I think the the

455
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,200
 next sphere show so make sure you bone up on it I think Leon absolutely no

456
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,600
 kidding around go to the sphere to watch this again oh that'd be amazing actually

457
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,520
 I'd do that today that'd be great maybe they'll get that that'd be really cool

458
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,360
 it would be really good they could do a lot of crazy shit with Citizen Kane so

459
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,160
 watching this movie with the assumption watching a watching a movie play that is

460
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,320
 assuming that I don't need to get any information from the movie is a weird

461
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,920
 experience already and then watching a movie that I have seen I mean who knows

462
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,880
 how many times I've seen the Wizard of Oz in my life I mean probably hundreds

463
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,280
 if not thousands of times back when we were kids it was on TV at least once a

464
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,760
 course yeah and I would watch it all the time is a big on TV yeah I've embarrassed

465
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,680
 my mom by saying this before but my mom did famously asked me one time a few

466
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,240
 years ago when they colorized the the middle part of Wizard of Oz oh my and I

467
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,720
 had to break it to her that they had not colorized it they that's how the movie

468
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,480
 had been made it was the first part in sepia and second part in color she said

469
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,040
 oh no no no when I was a little girl it was all in black and white mm-hmm and I

470
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:58,540
 said mom no no no when she was watching it she was watching it at her home on a

471
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:04,760
 black and white television exactly so it was all black and white just only for

472
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,560
 her oh people who watch it on black and white TVs I was like now you were

473
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,640
 watching at the black just you just be the family be carving up the recently

474
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,000
 microwaved hot dog and they'd watch it watch it over at the old black and white

475
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,520
 TV thanksgiving Matt they never had the luxury of microwaved hot dogs in the

476
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,320
 50s I didn't know the joys of the pudding just give a mental spirit through

477
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,360
 it and put two lighters on both ends they did do that shit they fucking would

478

 fork it and cook it like that all crazy that crazy remember did you ever see

479

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,780
 them and everything I go no we actually come up with everything right there on

527
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,480
 the fly we just we just go through and we talk about stuff and we have

528
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,400
 conversations and sometimes it takes us to fun places like a horse a talking

529
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,480
 horse with a prolapsed anus we don't we don't think about that at all before the

530
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:27,240
 show starts that's just what comes up but it's all we'll think about after no

531
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,520
 no still the second most disgusting thing said on this show today basically got a

532
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:41,520
 radio flyer wagon designed specifically to carry my anus. How do you carry your anus?

533
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:52,080
 I carry mine in a red radio flyer wagon. Thank you radio flyer. What I like about the

534
00:51:52,080 --> 00:52:07,040
 radio flyer is the color match the color match is pretty good for my anus. It turns out my anus is the exact shade of red as a radio flyer wagon.

535
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,240
 It's fairly it's fairly unobtrusive and people who don't know wouldn't wouldn't

536
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:26,520
 even know it's like I'm not wearing anything at all. It's very inconspicuous. Wizard of Oz thumbs up worth

537
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,520
 going very expensive expensive but but a fun ticket and definitely a different

538
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,480
 experience than anything I've seen I think anywhere before right yeah yeah

539
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,840
 it's a crazy thing it's a crazy thing for sure so you thought you think they're

540
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,520
 just gonna like well I mean I guess they're gonna keep cranking that one is

541
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,440
 there is it an indefinite run I think so yeah yeah I think it'll run until people

542
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,280
 stop buying thousands of tickets for it I actually know it's not even fully

543
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,760
 finished that's true they're still adding they're still gonna be adding more

544
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:08,400
 things to it yeah and they're selling stuff is there a merch thing associated oh

545
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,920

547
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,640

548
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,600
 t-shirt where you it says you putting a pill into a hot dog meat for Toto mm-hmm

549
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,880

550
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,560
 and ticks I know it makes my hands smell like the underside of a hobo's rectum

551
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:47,360
 but please just have it just the underside yes the underside of the

552
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,320
 uncovered underside of the whole underside of a hobo's rectum yes it

553
00:53:52,320 --> 00:54:02,400
 smells like dandelions and her hey scoops check out yeah yeah not finished

554
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,240
 winter scoop is it's what they're calling it's in its edging phase it's in

555
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:16,400
 that's right the Wizard of Oz I also ran into a friend of mine we went to the

556
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,560
 sphere with our cousins who were in town and they were laughing at us

557
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,400
 actually the same thing that we were talking about with James earlier they

558
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,240
 were like holy shit is it fun going out to entertainment things with Jacob and

559
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,880
 SJ because we just see people that we know the entire time of course so one

560
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,400
 of the people that we ran into was the artistic director from over at the new

561
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:45,080
 area 15 Universal Horror Nights and yeah so she like they've just gotten opened

562
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,320
 over there they're cranking it out I think they're still gonna make some

563
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,040
 changes over there I don't think they're done just like the sphere so I mean it

564
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,800
 is that that gives me a little bit of hope when we're talking about the the

565
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,720
 entertainment jobs going away and yeah oh yeah there's all there's old stuff

566
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,600
 that's that's getting hurt but there's always new stuff coming in as well so

567
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,440

 at Pizza Hut last year Americans ate an estimated 150 million hot dogs over the

604
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:35,440
 July 4th holiday we've taken the appropriate steps to notify the national

605
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,520
 sausage and hot dog council that they will need to adjust their statistics for

606
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,560
 2015 thanks to Pizza Hut's induction into hot dog bites pizza

607
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:53,400
 that's horrible someone in the chats as they ate it and did not enjoy it really

608
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,480

00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:03,080
 think of pizza is hot dog all right we got one to one tie right now Matt you're

618
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,240
 fuck out of here as we know Starbucks sits around and just daydreams about

619
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:13,920
 women in giant SUVs sitting at a drive-thru for 20 minutes and that's

620
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,000
 right and pulling out something that has a specific color and so this fits

621
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,280
 none of those categories and so I'm going to say false false fakeity fake I

622
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:32,080
 will say they do some stupid shit in the name of capitalist chicanery that fucking

623
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,960
 CEO that came in a while back and he knew a guy who knew a guy who had a fuck

 ton of olive oil they started putting olive oil and some of the lattes like

625
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,800

634
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,360
 Kentucky Fried Chicken has a game-changer for you and the fast food

635
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,720
 chain is pushing the limits of what we consider a beverage container with its

636
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,240
 latest announcement it's called the scoffee cup an edible cup made out of a

637
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,060
 wafer biscuit wrapped in sugar paper and lined with a heat resistant white

638
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:06,960
 chocolate no phony baloney Paul says phony baloney Matt I sure baloney phony

639
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,480
 let's go for it I would drink this the answer it's real

640
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,640
 shut the fuck up what if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and

641
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,160
 eat it why wouldn't we want them to have their cup and eat it instead that's from

642
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:29,280
 KFC spokeswoman Jocelyn Boney maybe told the USA Today the cups also feature

643
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:37,140
 aromas and come with the scents coconut sun cream and freshly cut grass the

644
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:44,280
 those last few descriptions are disgusting but that is a lawsuit waiting

645
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,120
 to happen I don't they've rolled it out nationally though I don't feel like I

646
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,960
 think it's not I've never seen that in my neighborhood yeah I don't know I don't

647
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,160
 know if that's a current thing or a past thing I think that thing failed

648
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,720
 miserably well it's so Leon Casaba saying it's British he wrote this thing

649
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,120
 so there you go but that makes sense now thinking about it as it's a scone cup

650
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:11,760
 it's not scoffy that does make sense right it's pot scone pot cup in it it I

710
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,360
 they're higher their upper crust class their executive class I guess even

711
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:07,360
 seems in the chat brought up an image of it already there it is they're gonna be

712
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:14,400
 selling that on the princess cruises it's a real deal I don't see we got let's

713
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,760
 do one more here captain crunch delights from Taco Bell this item is Taco Bell's

714
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,800
 first variation on Cinnabon delights a cream filled donut hole reminiscent of

715
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,240
 Cinnabon's cinnamon rolls the new cat and crunch delights are a donut hole

716
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:36,860
 version of a bowl of cat and crunch berry cereal with milk the pastry evokes

717
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:42,520
 a giant crunch berry with the familiar flaming pink color not found in nature

718
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:47,720
 the cream filling represents sweet cereal milk and the pastry is rolled in

719
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:54,480
 a coating of crushed cat and crunch cereal yeah I know whatever it is it

720
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:00,560
 sounds super healthy well I don't if this is this supposed to be ad copy or just

721
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,160
 yeah that would be their ad copy or their their press release but they

722
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:10,920
 wouldn't say they wouldn't say not found in nature I don't think oh interesting

723
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:20,880
 that's my and my other thought is Cinnabon having the the name of that

724
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,560
 stuff like they're not gonna share that with another company unless they're owned

725
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,680
 by the same parent company which I don't know they could be because there's only

726
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:36,200
 like four companies but I'm good is it my guess no it's Matt's guess okay but

01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,640
 you're doing great yeah Paul give me a lot of help there I'm gonna guess fake

01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,040
 it's a nostalgic throwback brand from when you were a kid said Amanda Clark

733
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,520
 Taco Bell's senior director of marketing we feel like it will appeal to what we

734
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:20,720
 call kiddults or the kid adults out there about what the hell what the hell kind of

735
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,880

01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,160
 are willing to take their eyes off the game to get the perfect bite but this

753
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:16,280
 season tostinos and legendary wide receiver Julian Edelman are changing the

754
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,200
 game and introducing the most creative way to snack tostinos salsa cereal for

755
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,560
 those asking themselves what salsa cereal is it's exactly what it sounds

756
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,560
 like eating chips and salsa with a bowl and a spoon it's a clever twist on the

757
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:36,320
 classic chips and salsa pairing that has been a game day staple for decades but

758
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,260
 makes it easier than ever for football fans to enjoy the game without ever

759
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:47,960
 needing to miss a second of the action plus milk plus milk what the fuck

760
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:56,760
 Matt you're up first false tostinos salsa cereal false in Matt's opinion Paul

761
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:03,080
 I'll tell you what gamesmanship and the only other thing is they included the

762
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:09,000
 name of a player that could just be nobody could have included the name of

763
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,160
 an NFL player without it being real no I got a gamesmanship I gotta I gotta true

764
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:20,680
 it are you going true I have to to games true on the salsa cereal because this is

765
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:25,760
 me and Matt oh I guess you're right I guess that is the right games play to

766
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,160
 make I have to he guessed false I gotta guess true that's true yeah yeah so it

767
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,860
 is it is the right gameplay move to make and and real honestly the use of the

768
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,200
 name of a player they don't you know there you go now they don't just throw

769
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,520
 names you don't have players around like that like there's nothing that's true

770
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:47,200
 that is true it's real Paul is right oh my god disgusting

771
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,880
 horrific game day staples tostinos chips and salsa have always gone hand-in-hand

772
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,700
 with watching football said Leslie Vesper vice president of marketing

773
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:00,920
 PepsiCo foods North America salsa cereal is the latest way we're bringing fans

774
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:08,920
 new experiences to enjoy the game and snacks to go with it no no god damn it

775
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:16,060
 no not interested Leslie Vesper not interested that's horrific that is

776
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:21,400
 horrific but I knew it as soon as they grabbed a player name barf doesn't make

777
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:26,040
 sense that that logic doesn't make sense I mean you were correct and I'm wrong

778
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,800
 but it's very easy to write a player's name into a fake thing but Matt we have

779
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,560
 discussed this many many times I get to the right answer the wrong way all the

780
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,040
 time oh Jesus there it is look see it's got his face in the chat

781
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:48,160

782
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:55,800
 it yeah see it's the corn concert don't hit me in the back of the head but

783
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,560
 that's the big thing right now is having these players and people you know do

784
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:08,600
 these big collabos yeah there was some person it's happening now to me to the

785

 point where because I'm unloading all these boxes of shit and there's a some
