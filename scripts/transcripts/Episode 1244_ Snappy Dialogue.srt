1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 Oh hello there, I am so glad you are here because I want to thank you, the ice cream truck drivers.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
 These are the folks that deliver that ice cream straight to your ear holes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Right now I'd like to thank Travis Jagare, Thunder, Cougar, Falcon, Scoop, the lost ice cream truck driver,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,500
 Slurpee Kaey, Motherfucker, Scoop Kata, Scoop Dijor, Scoop Brady, and Sax Guy, Jimmy D. Scoop.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver just like these fine folks, head over to PreachingFun.com.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
 PreachingFun.com is where you go to sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 your life you save may be your own.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Here's a show.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey Johnny, do you want to go to an ice cream social?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
 Yeah, I'd love to.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
 Great, let's go.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,500
 Scoopfest coming up at the end of the month. We won't talk about it the whole episode, but I'm going to say it now.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,000
 Scoopfest.com, head over there, join us here in beautiful Las Vegas at the end of September. It's going to be awesome.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
 So soon.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 It's time for Matt and Mattingly's Ice Cream Social. Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly. Also sitting in Las Vegas, me and Jacob the Audio Guy.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 We're PreachingFun.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
 Hey everybody. That's a nice hat tonight, Jacob.

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 Thank you, thank you. I like that one.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 Paul, you were asleep, so we had our first Scoopfest crisis, but you were asleep, so we didn't bother you.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 Yeah, I appreciate that. What happened?

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,500
 Well, that lineup subject to change asterisks is really coming into play this time.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
 Okay. Yeah, the asterisks has changed.

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 Alright. Just one thing. Just one of them.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 Right, but we already had some stuff made up that's going to have to just be like, well...

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 Oh no, we've already gotten...

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 Lanyards and stuff, yeah.

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 No, we've already gotten sub people in, and yeah, we're all good.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 Oh, yes.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
 So the lanyards weren't printed with the old info yet?

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 Oh, no, the lanyards are printed, the schedule on the lanyards is going to be wrong.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
 We're fucked.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 That's fine, that's fine.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 There's one event on the lanyard that's going to be a different name than what's on the lanyard. That's okay.

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 That's the way it goes.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 In the same time slot, no problem.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 I appreciate you guys letting me sleep.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 I, again, like I said, been fighting a cold.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 You can hear it in my chest.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 My head is really hurting today.

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
 And I slept in because I was off today.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 And Ann didn't go in until late, so she was handling the dogs.

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 Man, I was out. I was in bed until 11.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 So, yeah, it was...

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 P.O.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 11 a.m.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 Slept all day.

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 Yeah, I slept all day. No, no, no.

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 Now, does Ann factor in your sickness when she hates you for being a wuss, for not going into work because you weren't scheduled?

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 Smart.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 I'll have you know that that all got resolved.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 So, my non-schedule had...

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Ranch Slunk in the chat is already blaming the microwave hot dogs for your illness, Paul.

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Two components, though.

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 I agree.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 Ranch Slunk, by the way, is correct.

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 I didn't have any microwave hot dogs yesterday.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 We had pizza. Ann and I ordered pizza.

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 Fired up the oven?

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 No, we got Domino's.

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 We got Domino's. It was great fun.

63
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
 We were having one of those nights.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 We were really being fun with each other.

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 We love just hanging out on the couch being catty bitches.

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 We watch this show right now called...

67
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 What is it called?

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 Stuart's Crossing?

69
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 It's not Stuart's Crossing.

70
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 Sullivan's Crossing.

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 Sullivan's Crossing.

72
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 Have you guys heard of this show?

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 I've heard of it.

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 Canadian Scoop Crystals is pumping her fist.

75
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 Yeah, it's a Canuck production.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 It is heavily Canadian, this show.

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 They got...

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 Sponsored by Tim Artins.

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 They got some folks in the show who you would refer to in Canada as Native characters.

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 Like Native Americans, Native North Americans.

81
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 So they got some of that.

82
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 It's sort of like Northern Exposure, but not funny.

83
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
 Oh, so just like Northern Exposure.

84
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 No, it's not funny.

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 Stay down, Northern Exposure.

86
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 And it leans pretty heavy into stereotypical, romance-y dumb stuff.

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 First Nations, First People, yes.

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 So they have this guy, it's the guy from Gilmore Girls who was Luke, who I can't remember.

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 The romantic lead in Gilmore Girls.

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 Oh, from Gilmore...

91
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 Luke from Gilmore Girls?

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 Listen, buddy.

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
 I've watched that series as well.

94
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 These are the shows that I watch with the wife.

95
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 If you just want like a time-out, Paul, to get all your facts together, we can do that.

96
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 We can figure out something.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 Just saying.

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 Because you keep asking us for things that definitely, Jacob and I have never come close to watching.

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 You've never seen Gilmore Girls.

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 Stop yelling at me.

101
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 No, it's... that's a snappy dialogue.

102
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 Good show.

103
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 That's a good show.

104
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 Snappy dialogue?

105
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 See you later, guys.

106
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 I have to go stream the Gilmore Girls.

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 Matt has left the Zoom chat.

108
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 Matt will be back on the show after he's watched the Gilmore Girls.

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 Hey, guys, I'm back.

110
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
 I just watched a preview.

111
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 I can't believe the snappiness.

112
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,500
 So much snappiness.

113
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Anyway, it's a good little show.

114
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 But this Sullivan's Crossing is cray-cray.

115
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 Cray-cray.

116
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 The guy is basically just an unlikable character.

117
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 He's just an old curmudgeon who runs a camp.

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
 He's got this Sullivan's Crossing.

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
 He goes, "Call me Sully. Blah, I'm Sully."

120
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 Name a Sullivan who wasn't called Sully.

121
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 That's what I know.

122
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 Who was like, "Call me Van."

123
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 Right.

124
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 No, he's just Sullivan.

125
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 Call me Van.

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 Van's Crossing.

127
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 His daughter.

128
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 There's one of them out there that I just call Goose Killer now.

129
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 Wait, does that mean the whole time it's been Sullivan?

130
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
 Sullivan Halen?

131
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 Is that the way we should be?

132
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
 Oh my gosh, it should have been Sullivan Halen.

133
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Maybe it's Sylvainian Van Halen.

134
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 Sylvainian Halen.

135
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our show.

136
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 We are Sylvain Halen.

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 We are the number one tribute rock band.

138
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 We celebrate Van Halen and Sullivan's Crossings.

139
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 It is the best two things.

140
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 Sylvain Halen.

141
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 Here we are.

142
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 Sylvain Morrison.

143
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 If I had anything to reference Sullivan's Crossings,

144
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 I would do so right now for the sake of the joke.

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,500
 His estranged daughter comes back to Sullivan's Crossing.

146
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 She's gone on to be a brain surgeon.

147
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 She's a literal, supposed to be a brain surgeon.

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 Now, Matt, how many years of education?

149
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
 How dare I even reach her?

150
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 You know, I've got the hots.

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 Yeah, I've got the hots for teacher.

152
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 That's it.

153
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
 That's it.

154
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 Matt.

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
 Matt.

156
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 You've got to talk to your boys.

157
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 I know what I was going to say.

158
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 Right now.

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 Right now.

160
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 They've got to do a couple Van Halen covers.

161
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
 Yep.

162
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 Don't say anything else, Paul.

163
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 I'm done.

164
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 It's on our WhatsApp thread.

165
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
 It'll be on there.

166
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 Ah, shoes burning down the avenue.

167
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 I'm hot for teacher.

168
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
 What do you say?

169
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 What do you know?

170
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 I'm hot for teacher.

171
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 Eruption is what I was just thinking of.

172
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 Which one?

173
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 Yeah.

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 Eruption.

175
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 Just the guitar solo.

176
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 On accordion or harpsichord?

177
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 Yeah.

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 That's it.

179
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 Oh Lord.

180
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 That's...

181
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 Panama.

182
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 I've never been to Panama.

183
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 I've never been.

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 I'll never go.

185
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 Panama.

186
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 The country's quite large.

187
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 I'm stuck here.

188
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 Are there any pubs in Panama?

189
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 You know what his son was named?

190
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 Wolfgang.

191
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
 Wolfgang Sullivan Halen.

192
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
 All right.

193
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 I love the skip and dance.

194
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 I might just watch the show.

195
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 No.

196
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 Oh.

197
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 So the girl comes back and she's a neurosurgeon.

198
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
 After all of that.

199
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 I'm so sorry.

200
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 She's a neurosurgeon.

201
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 How many years would you think would take to become a neurosurgeon?

202
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 Eight.

203
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 Study.

204
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 At least eight.

205
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
 Yeah.

206
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 She's presenting around 24 tops.

207
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 Okay.

208
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 Okay.

209
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 So we're already starting to do ramp jumps of logic.

210
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 Canadian Dookie Howser for those making a temporary reference.

211
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 Not even.

212
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 But she's not with it.

213
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 She misses everything.

214
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 Everything.

215
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 Everything.

216
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
 Everything.

217
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 Everything.

218
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
 Everything.

219
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 Her dad's a former alcoholic, recovering alcoholic.

220
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 She just misses everything.

221
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 Everything.

222
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 But one of the things that happened in this last episode that we watched.

223
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
 He gets hospitalized with a heart condition.

224
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 Had a heart something go on.

225
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 And he's in the hospital.

226
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 And around all of this is the looming possibility that he's going to lose this Sullivan's crossing

227
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 campground because he can't pay the bills.

228
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 And Anne and I just looked at each other like he had a heart attack and was hospitalized.

229
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 If this was America, the show is over.

230
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 He has gone into full on.

231
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
 Bankruptcy.

232
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 Forever debt.

233
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 He can't even do bankruptcy with medical debt.

234
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
 He's done.

235
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 He's done.

236
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 We were just like, this is amazing to see this from a Canadian perspective.

237
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 And he also got belligerent in the hospital and pushed a doctor and stuff.

238
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 And we're like, there would have been a security officer there shooting him in the head if

239
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 this was the States.

240
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 It's just so crazy to watch with a non-Canadian eye.

241
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 Oh, that's true.

242
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 Scoop Jesus in the chat is pointing out that Breaking Bad, just the concept of the show

243
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 of Breaking Bad does not work in Canada.

244
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
 Because the whole impetus for the show is that he gets sick and can't afford the cancer

245
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 treatment.

246
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 That was everyone's number one takeaway from Breaking Bad.

247
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 And that's why you saw so much medical reform.

248
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
 That's right.

249
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 That's right.

250
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 Instead of medical reform, we have pizzas on roofs.

251
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 It is crazy.

252
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 Blue math.

253
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 That's actually what we got.

254
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 We have pizza on roofs and blue math.

255
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 You look at any hit drama.

256
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 That's exactly what we got.

257
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 Any hit drama that we've had of late.

258
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 The last, what, 20 years?

259
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 Yeah.

260
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 Yeah.

261
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 None of it works outside of the States because of the bullshit that we have integrated into

262
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 our society.

263
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 Well, so many movies, and then you get into the dated stuff.

264
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 So many movies in the States.

265
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 You've got the healthcare stuff.

266
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 And then the older movies, the plot goes away if anybody has a cell phone.

267
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 Right.

268
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 All these things.

269
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
 It's great.

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 The whole movie goes away if things just aren't terrible.

271
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 Well, I mean, the show, The Wire, is one of the most celebrated shows we've made.

272
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
 We don't need wires anymore.

273
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 Right.

274
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 The Wire, we don't need a wire.

275
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 And every season, that's it.

276
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 That whole show is just built on, every season was a different systematic failure of our

277
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 government bureaucracy.

278
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 Yeah.

279
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 It's just wild.

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 And then you get into the show that kind of started all of those back in the day on HBO.

281
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 You had Oz.

282
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 And it's just about, like, if you have any prison reform or if you have a decent justice

283
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 system, you don't have that show.

284
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
 Right.

285
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 No, that show is about hot prison sex and I'm here for it.

286
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 Oh, man.

287
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 Oh, I'm not saying they're not great shows or that they don't have the amount of prison

288
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 sex that I need to get through the day.

289
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 I'm just saying they don't work outside of the U.S.

290
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 I'm happy with every other part of them.

291
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 But we're just, we're just watching that show and just mocking it at every turn and having

292
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 a good laugh here and there and really enjoys it though.

293
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 And it is kind of a nice relaxing show.

294
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 And I mean, it's honestly, it's like it's fantasy for us.

295
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 We're like, oh, man, you imagine living somewhere where people could talk to their neighbors

296
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 and then you could go and get taken care of when you had a heart attack and not lose your

297
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 fucking place of business.

298
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 Oh, God.

299
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 Not free enough.

300
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 Yeah, you're right.

301
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 You're right.

302
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 Totally not free.

303
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 Not free enough to suffer.

304
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 Where is your freedom to pay?

305
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 Oh, well, it's a weird topic to bring up on a comedy show.

306
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 But we were on the air the other day during the Charlie Kirk stuff.

307
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
 Oh, no, we can't talk about that.

308
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 We're not talking about it at all.

309
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 All I want to talk about with that is that it fucked me up for the day.

310
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 Well, sure.

311
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 Yeah.

312
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 Getting getting getting news that someone just got killed for being on shows, voicing

313
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 opinions like it fucked me up for the whole day.

314
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 I made a point to go to my comic book store, even though it was late in the day and I needed

315
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 I needed just I just picked up a few.

316
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 Oh, but here's OK.

317
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
 So to shift topics completely.

318
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 Yeah, do it.

319
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 Do it.

320
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 I just wanted to say because we were on the air when it came out and then the show came

321
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 out and everything.

322
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 It feels weird to not say something about it.

323
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
 But that's that's kind of what it was.

324
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 We don't need to go.

325
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 I mean, it happened right when we were on.

326
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 And then yes, the last couple of days have been not so weird, not so weird.

327
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
 Yeah.

328
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 Bad news, Matt.

329
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
 I get over guys.

330
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 Guys, guys, I got it.

331
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 I was reading up on on Israel and Gaza.

332
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 Should we just go there?

333
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 Should we?

334
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,500
 No, let's just let's shift over to a fun topic at at the comic book shop.

335
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 I got to pick this up.

336
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 It's a brand new arc, brand new start of a new run of powers.

337
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 Oh, Matt's kids are going to be so.

338
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 So I'm so sorry that your son is probably going to find more of these books now and just

339
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,500
 go to whackety jackety town for everybody on Twitch.

340
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 Just open up the centerfold.

341
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
 Show everybody the centerfold.

342
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 Let's see.

343
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 Let's see what the centerfold is.

344
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
 Don't do it on Twitch.

345
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 Look at the next issue.

346
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 Oh, my goodness.

347
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 Oh, wow.

348
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
 That's just that's just a jizz.

349
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 Yeah, I don't know what's going on there.

350
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 Yeah, it's not even drawn on there.

351
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 That's just all just showed us his jisms on a comic book.

352
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 Well, I'll take this.

353
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 I will show you.

354
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 That's just him.

355
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 Speaking of those laminated, speaking of a dialogue, this is Bendis dialogue right here.

356
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 That's what that that's what Bendis is known for.

357
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
 Just talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.

358
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 For those of you who can't see the video, Paul just held up a comic book to the camera.

359
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 It was a full panel.

360
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 Just chuck a block with word.

361
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 It looked like a lot of speech bubbles.

362
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
 A lot of word balloons.

363
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 Yes.

364
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 That's some that's a that's a Bendis hallmark right there.

365
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 And I'm pleased to see that again.

366
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 I'm looking forward to reading this new arc and seeing where it goes.

367
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 So yay.

368
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 New powers is out, everybody.

369
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
 New powers, new powers, new powers.

370
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
 Yeah, dead last celebrating as well.

371
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 That's good.

372
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 And what else?

373
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 Oh, and then and then I got this too.

374
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
 This is for those other super nerds out there.

375
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
 Transformers issue 24.

376
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 This is the culmination of the two year arc done by Daniel Warren Johnson and Jorge Corona.

377
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 This is the end of this story.

378
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 And this book has been incredibly successful.

379
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 What's his name?

380
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 Kirkman from Walking Dead.

381
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 This is one of his side project things.

382
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 He's taking over the main writing.

383
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 So that's going to be really interesting.

384
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 I would love to see the possibility of a Kirkman Transformers storyline that could be made.

385
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 Yes.

386
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
 Television or film thing.

387
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 Preach.

388
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 Right.

389
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 No, no.

390
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 Do you know what Kirkman would add to that to that comic, Paul?

391
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 What would he add?

392
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 Snappy dialogue.

393
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 He's my dad.

394
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 Get some snappy dialogue in there.

395
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 So much snappy dialogue.

396
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 He's the guy behind.

397
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 You would open the comic.

398
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 It would snap right back close.

399
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 That's how snappy the dialogue would be.

400
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 Oh, it's so snappy.

401
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 Couldn't read it.

402
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 He does have some pretty good dialogue.

403
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
 I mean, he's the guy behind Walking Dead.

404
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 He's the guy behind Invincible.

405
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 And I would love to see an Invincible style cartoon helmed by Robert Kirkman for Transformers.

406
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 I think that'd be awesome.

407
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 Are you watching any of the Peacemaker, Paul?

408
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 Peacemaker, Peacemaker.

409
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 Oh, I haven't watched the new season yet.

410
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 Yeah, I haven't either.

411
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 The first season was so good.

412
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 I really like the first season.

413
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 It was so funny.

414
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 Is it good?

415
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 Okay.

416
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 Yes.

417
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 How many episodes are we in now?

418
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 I think three.

419
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 I haven't watched two, but I think I have one on the hopper.

420
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 Scoop Jesus in the chat.

421
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
 I'm with you.

422
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
 We're letting it get a little ahead.

423
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 Yes.

424
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 And we'll probably binge a couple episodes at a time.

425
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 That's kind of my thing.

426
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 Yeah, I always want to give it a little.

427
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 That's what I'm doing with Task.

428
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
 Oh.

429
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 Oh, how is that?

430
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 We tried to watch it.

431
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 I've heard it's good, but I'm not trying it yet.

432
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 I'm waiting for three or four or five episodes before I get into it.

433
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 We tried to watch it yesterday during all the, "Ugh," and we're watching it.

434
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 And Ann's like, "I'm already just a bundle of nerves and nothing's even happened in this

435
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 thing."

436
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,220
 Nothing happens in the first 20 minutes or so that we watched, and she's just like, "Ugh."

437
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,500
 And I was like, "Fine, I'll turn it off."

438
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,380
 And I'm like, "We just watched that 'Evil Lives Here' latest episode with that horrible

439
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,540
 kid that ended up going crazy and killed his mom and all that nutty stuff."

440
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,520
 And she's like, "Yeah, but that's true.

441
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,740
 This is made up.

442
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,580
 Let's just watch what's already actually happened.

443
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,460
 Why do we have to keep making up horrible stuff?"

444
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,860
 I'm like, "Okay, you're right.

445
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
 You're right.

446
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,220
 We should focus on the reality of the horror show that is existent and not the fictional

447
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,340
 horror show."

448
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,380
 Also, we are going to talk about Gaza.

449
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,740
 Oh, my God.

450
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
 This is outrageous.

451
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
 That one I stopped watching.

453
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,260
 Did you ever get into Nerdcore rap?

454
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,260
 MC Chris.

455
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,860
 Yes, I love MC Chris.

456
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,340
 And who's the other one that I like?

457
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:32,780
 Well, there's a couple, but there's another guy that used to do PAX every year.

458
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,540
 He was a mainstay.

459
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,660
 But yeah, MC Chris is still my Nerdcore rap guy.

460
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
 Why?

461
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
 What's that?

462
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,540
 I like a band that was Nerdcore rap without me knowing it was Nerdcore rap.

463
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,220
 When I looked them up recently, I was literally on the plane and I was like, "I want to listen

464
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
 to something."

465
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
 I'm like, "Why?"

466
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,020
 I would say I have nothing to listen to, and I used to listen to a ton of music, and I'm

467
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,500
 always at a loss of what to listen to.

468
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,580
 I do the same things, right?

469
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:06,140
 I go into David Bowie or Tom Waits, Jag, or something like that, and then it's predictable.

470
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,580
 I'm on a good music kick right now.

471
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,300
 I'll tell you about it when you're done.

472
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
 Was it?

473
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,740
 I was like, "Oh, there was this band that crushed ... I saw them multiple times because

474
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
 they just were always in lineups.

475
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
 They were never the headliner.

476
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
 They were always in lineups.

477
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,700
 A band called Two Skinny Jays.

478
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,420
 Are you familiar with them?

479
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,860
 I have heard of them.

480
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,100
 I am not familiar with their oeuvre.

481
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,060
 They have one major album called Volumizer, and I put it on and I was like ... I thought

482
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,660
 I was going to basically put it on and maybe be embarrassed or just nostalgic.

483
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
 Uh-huh.

484
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,220
 It is still a really good album.

485
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
 It's a bang, huh?

486
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,180
 It has some crazy, well-written lyrics, really good hooks.

487
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,660
 They're very good musicians.

488
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,260
 It's not constructed hooks.

489
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,820
 They were a live band.

490
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,460
 They got crushed at ... within a year and a half in college, somebody saw them twice

491
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,180
 in concert at two different locations.

492
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,140
 They must have been based out in the East Coast.

493
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
 East Coast somewhere, yeah, yeah.

494
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,420
 That's why Madden didn't finish college.

495
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,420
 He was too busy following around the Two Skinny Jays.

496
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,260
 Here's another person I saw too much of without being a huge fan.

497
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,500
 G-Love and the Special Sauce.

498
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 Have you heard of them at all?

499
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 G-Love and the Special Sauce?

500
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 Yes, I remember them.

501
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 No.

502
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Oh, they had a couple of hits.

503
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
 They were more mainstream than Two Skinny Jays.

504
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,620
 They actually had a couple of legit hits.

505
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,900
 They were out of Philadelphia, and lyrically it's inescapable that they are from Philadelphia.

506
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,720
 I say that as a Springsteen fan.

507
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,060
 He never sings about Jersey.

508
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,860
 That's one of the jams that Two Skinny Jays does that's very rare.

509
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,180
 Grown Up is a good one to check it out.

510
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,900
 I think I may know this song.

511
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,860
 You've rattled something in my head from way back.

512
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
 Yeah.

513
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,420
 Grown Ups is the movie that they wrote starring Adam Sandler?

514
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
 That's right.

515
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
 Themed song.

516
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
 Yep.

517
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
 Yeah.

518
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,900
 The opening song of Horns of Destruction is really great.

519
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,140
 Horns of Destruction is really funny.

520
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,300
 Lemon Drop is a good one.

521
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,180
 But yeah, I was just going through it and I was really like, "Oh man, I'm usually embarrassed

522
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
 about my music taste."

523
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,460
 There was actually one band I thought of that I cannot go back, but I laughed when I thought

524
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,140
 of their name.

525
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,780
 So I won't even go back and listen to it.

526
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
 It's too embarrassing.

527
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
 I know it's bad.

528
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
 Oh no.

529
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,700
 I remember because I remember this really, really cringy incident of when I was on the

530
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:45,660
 team bus for the basketball team and our team was basically half white and half black at

531
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,060
 my JV squad when I was playing basketball.

532
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,420
 And spoiler alert, the black guys were better at basketball.

533
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,060
 Oh, that's where that rumor started.

534
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,060
 Honestly, the cooler black kids would go sit in the back of the bus.

535
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,580
 That's the way it works.

536
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:12,700
 And they would all be putting their headphones on listening to different discs on their disc

537
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
 bands.

538
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
 Sure.

539
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,540
 And I got turned into like one song by a rapper called MeFi Me.

540
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,740
 Okay.

541
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
 I can't even.

542
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
 I won't.

543
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,580
 If I listen to them now, I'll just vomit out of embarrassment.

544
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,540
 I had MeFi Me on and I was like, oh, I might know a really awesome rapper that maybe they're

545
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,700
 not familiar with.

546
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:45,940
 And so I remember like bobbing my head and like really showing that you were doing some

547
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
 hip hopping.

548
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
 Yeah.

549
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,060
 You were signaling that you were enjoying the hip hop.

550
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,780
 I want the cooler black kids to know that I'm listening to hip hop and they're going

551
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:59,500
 to ask me who and I'm going to say MeFi Me and they're going to go what?

552
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,180
 And that's exactly what happened with the exception of the positive reaction.

553
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,700
 Okay.

554
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,260
 They were like, get that trash out of here.

555
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
 I never heard of that.

556
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
 One guy's like, yeah, I heard one.

557
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
 He's got one trick that's okay.

558
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
 And then the guy was like, oh.

559
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
 I'm like.

560
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
 Well, that's all right.

561
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,260
 That's a start.

562
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,140
 And then they just made fun of me for being into it.

563
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,500
 They're like, but you were really into it.

564
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,060
 Oh, man.

565
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
 See.

566
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,540
 It's Donnelly's worst nightmare.

567
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,340
 This is our difference in age.

568
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,300
 This is our difference in age showing.

569
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 And I was just lucky.

570
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,940
 I was just lucky because I was a few years ahead of you and into the hip hop stuff, which

571
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,340
 I'm just going to argue was a golden age of hip hop that I came up in.

572
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,500
 And so you would talk about someone who never gets embarrassed.

573
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 I don't get embarrassed.

574
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,100
 I don't give a shit.

575
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,140
 I've always put my freak flag very high and not giving a fuck what people think I would

576
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,940
 be in the back of the bus with my boombox on field trips and my two deck cassette player.

577
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,500
 I would vacillate between body count, public enemy, fear of a black planet, the Disney

578
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 afternoon soundtrack, and they might be giants.

579
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 I mean, what?

580
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,260
 All over the place.

581
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
 Crazy shit.

582
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
 You know what I mean?

583
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
 I ain't give a fuck.

584
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,380
 All the hits, all the hits, all over the place.

585
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,640
 And then I really lucked out.

586
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,620
 I really scored some points at Governor's Scholars.

587
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
 Yes.

588
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,300
 Paul definitely had the over the shoulder boombox at Governor's Scholars Program.

589
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,420
 Don't think anything else for a moment.

590
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,380
 No, it was too wide for, I mean, you could, but it had a handle.

591
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,260
 But Governor's Scholars Program, we had a field trip out to a mall one day.

592
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,780
 Paul put that double decker right on his lap like a villain with a cat.

593
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,300
 That's exactly how I rocked it.

594
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:04,420
 What I did have was a 60 cassette case that I held over my, I had all my ammunition belt.

595
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,540
 I was a straight up, no, not an amp, but it was a padded case, a padded case that held

596
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
 30 cassettes.

597
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
 What?

598
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,420
 Well, it was like the movie poster for Commando with just cassette decks all over them.

599
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,260
 There's Chewbacca with tapes on my bandolier.

600
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,060
 I was ready at any time.

601
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,540
 Whatever the, whatever the thing I had, I had everything, man.

602
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
 I had it all.

603
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,740
 Scoop Jesus says you look like John Popper.

604
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:37,940
 I had, I had Pantera, I had fucking, what's his name, the Harry Connick dude.

605
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,220
 I had it all.

606
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,940
 I would go between Pantera and Harry Connick in the drop of a hat.

607
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,000
 At Governor's Scholars, we went to this mall field trip and we bought some stuff.

608
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,380
 I bought Tribe Called Quest's Low End Theory album.

609
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
 It had just come out.

610
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 Oh, that's a good album.

611
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
 That's a good album.

612
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
 It came out that week.

613
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
 Yeah.

614
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:06,540
 Getting on the bus, some of the other kids and some of the other hip hop heads were like,

615
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,260
 "Oh, let's listen to that."

616
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,100
 They played it on the bus speakers.

617
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:19,260
 The whole bus was listening to Low End Theory on the ride, thanks to my purchasing finesse

618
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,860
 of making sure that I got that new Tribe album, which was just, that's just a fantastic album.

619
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
 It's a masterpiece.

620
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
 Paul Mattingly, everyone.

621
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
 You're welcome, everyone.

622
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
 Hero.

623
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
 Paul Mattingly.

624
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
 Hero.

625
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:37,220
 Ten Scoop is showing exactly how Spock would have handled me back then, but it was a different

626
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,340
 time before the rise of headphones like that.

627
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,700
 You know who else listened to a whole bunch of Mattingly's cassettes in the back of a

628
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
 school bus?

629
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
 Mattingly didn't know they were there, though.

630
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
 That's the following sponsor.

631
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,660
 I would have been popped in my head so hard.

632
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
 Yeah.

633
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
 I know you were.

634
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
 Pop.

635
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,020
 Today's show is brought to you by Women, brought to you by Tom Cruise.

636
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,180
 That's from MLK in 2025.

637
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,260
 Today's sponsor is Women, brought to you by Tom Cruise.

638
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,860
 Hey, everybody.

639
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
 It's me, Tom Cruise.

640
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,940
 I'd like to present Women.

641
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,700
 I'd like to, but I can't.

642
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
 Yeah.

643
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
 Oh, I got to run.

644
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
 I got to run to my next-- shoot.

645
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,220
 Oh, boy.

646
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,500
 I'd also have trouble presenting Women, because my good friend David Miscavige misplaces his,

647
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,780
 and we don't try to find them.

648
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,580
 That's just how it goes.

649
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
 Allegedly.

650
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
 Who knows?

651
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,500
 Enter eight scoops of checkout.

652
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 Yeah.

653
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 I was thinking about Tom Cruise this morning, and then everyone makes fun of him for running,

654
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,300
 and he always likes to run in his films, and he always runs full speed.

655
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,540
 And then I was like, oh, I couldn't do that.

656
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:48,940
 If I booked a part, and they're like, this is where you run full speed to the airport

657
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,500
 for like 30 seconds, I'd be like, oh, this is going to look terrible.

658
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,260
 I don't think anybody makes fun of Tom Cruise, though.

659
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:01,220
 We don't make fun of his running because he's an older gentleman and is bad at running.

660
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,380
 We make fun of it because he does it so often.

661
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,500
 I don't think there's any question that Tom Cruise is in great shape for a man of his

662
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 age.

663
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 Yeah.

664
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,780
 It's not like he's like, oh, I have to do this.

665
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,700
 He's coming to the producers and being like, can I dangle from a plane, please?

666
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,260
 This is the part where I run.

667
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
 Yeah.

668
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,540
 He's making it happen, Matt.

669
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,980
 Don't feel bad that way.

670
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
 You're going to be fine.

671
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,180
 Also, in today's modern age, what sense does it make not to be on roller skates or some

672
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,420
 sort of ambulatory device that could make you go even faster than running?

673
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:36,740
 I was thinking, they'd have to ride in like an electric scooter for me to be like, and

674
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,260
 I was like, oh, that'd be really fun just to actually see an electric scooter chase.

675
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
 Yeah.

676
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:47,700
 It's like really fucking like born identity level, but just pushing that little thumb

677
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
 button.

678
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
 It'd be fun.

679
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
 Yeah.

680
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
 It'd be good.

681
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
 Man, I am a sucker for those.

682
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,740
 I treated myself in San Antonio.

683
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,860
 I always go try to get my steps in, right, so try to get my 10,000 steps in.

684
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
 Yeah.

685
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,700
 And so I kept telling myself that I'd rather have electric scooters, but every time I just

686
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
 had...

687
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,940
 It was hot, so I had to get my steps in close at night, close to midnight, or whatever.

688
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,660
 But the last night, I go, oh, I know what I'm going to do.

689
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,660
 I'm going to walk.

690
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,260
 I only had to walk for like 15 minutes.

691
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,140
 I go, I'm going to walk 15 minutes straight out of town and I'm going to find one of those

692
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,220
 scooters and ride it back.

693
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,220
 Yeah.

694
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,780
 And that's what I did my last night.

695
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,980
 And man, I know it's so dumb they go like whatever, 15 miles an hour, but bopping and

696
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,820
 zipping through the streets at night and you're just going all over it because it was a Sunday

697
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,380
 night, right?

698
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,700
 That whole week, whenever I'm there, it's like a show because the river walks the center

699
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,700
 of attention and it builds during the week and then it's crazy in the weekends.

700
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,940
 And then Sunday, it's like you feel like it's great receding.

701
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
 I remember the Sunday night bar shit.

702
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,620
 It's probably busier than Vegas right now.

703
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,620
 Probably.

704
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,500
 Although I guess the reports come from people who worked with that company or that tourism

705
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,980
 is down in a lot of places, not just Vegas.

706
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
 No.

707
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
 Yeah, sure.

708
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
 What?

709
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,980
 Yeah.

710
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980
 Probably unrelated to anything else.

711
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,540
 In the United States of America?

712
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
 Yeah.

713
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
 Yeah.

714
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
 Yeah.

715
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
 Yeah.

716
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
 The land of dreams?

717
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,540
 Yeah.

718
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,820
 Where the rivers flow with milk and honey?

719
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,500
 Because if people pick up the news, there's nothing but sunshine and rainbows here.

720
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 Right.

721
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:29,220
 This is just like the Garden of Eden out here on the good ship, lollipop.

722
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,820
 But no, so Sunday night it was dead.

723
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,780
 And so I basically had the streets of San Antonio to myself.

724
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,960
 That's right.

725
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,460
 I want to say it very romantically like that.

726
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,020
 I just zipped around.

727
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
 I was loving it.

728
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,140
 I probably look like a big idiot, but I had loved it.

729
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,780
 I had my Mi Fi Mi on my headphones and...

730
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
 Great.

731
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,020
 Before you listening to Streets of Philadelphia and replacing it, "San Antonio."

732
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
 San Antonio.

733
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,380
 I was just singing that loudly to myself.

734
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,340
 "The streets of San Antonio."

735
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,780
 It almost fits the meter.

736
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,660
 It means red stick, I'd yell as I drove down the street.

737
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
 That's right.

738
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,660
 That's right.

739
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,460
 Have you had a show since, since you've modified your language yet?

740
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,460
 No, not yet.

741
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,540
 Not yet.

742
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,340
 My next magic show will be at ScoopFest.

743
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
 Okay.

744
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,220
 Where I'm only doing things they haven't seen.

745
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
 Sweet.

746
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,500
 New, new stuff.

747
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,580
 Bunch of, a bunch of feet stuff.

748
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
 Yeah.

749
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
 A lot of feet stuff.

750
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
 A lot of feet.

751
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
 A lot of bare feet.

752
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
 A lot of bare feet.

753
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
 Magic.

754
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
 Yeah.

755
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,220
 Borrowed, borrowed, and returned feet.

756
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,820
 Oh my God.

757
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,180
 Foot to impossible location.

758
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
 Foot to impossible location.

759
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
 Matt.

760
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
 You know.

761
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,180
 Foot tip.

762
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
 I use a foot tip in this trick.

763
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:50,780
 So we have yet to actually implement with PNT the, the, the magic that is magic Wanda.

764
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,100
 That's true.

765
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,860
 How about we have magic Wanda and your bare foot with googly eyes on it.

766
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
 Yeah.

767
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,420
 And we call him Presto.

768
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
 Presto.

769
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

770
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
 Huh?

771
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
 Huh?

772
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

773
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

774
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,420
 Magic Wanda and Presto.

775
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,300
 Somebody just laying underneath the curtain with their foot up in the air.

776
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,220
 Dude, that's a YouTube channel if I've ever heard one right there.

777
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,220
 I know.

778
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
 That is, that's gold.

779
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,380
 It's also in 12 years the best idea that Paul has come up with.

780
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,280
 And he's like, pitch this to pin, Matt.

781
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
 They did sled a foot.

782
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
 This is by far.

783
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 They did sled a foot.

784
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 Did they?

785
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
 Three seasons ago.

786
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 Oh, that's right.

787
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
 Yeah.

788
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
 Yeah, they did on Fool Us, right?

789
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

790
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:45,460
 And that was one where I helped work on that trick and I gave Penn a button on it.

791
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
 Okay.

792
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,140
 Where after the whole thing was over, he says like, oh, you can put those cards back together

793
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,700
 or whatever.

794
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,560
 And then she, the volunteer goes to do it, I go, no, with your feet.

795
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
 And they like that.

796
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
 And that was always there.

797
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
 They're out.

798
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,440
 And then I went to record at Penn Sunday School and Penn said, Matt, you are a genius.

799
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,380
 And then Teller wrote me an email saying, you are a genius.

800
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
 Wow.

801
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,100
 And I didn't know why.

802
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,180
 And then Penn told me at Penn Sunday School is that basically like this very hammered

803
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,060
 girl came up to do a sleight of feet.

804
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,940
 And when they yell no with your feet, she was like, oh, okay.

805
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,580
 And she just flipped herself upside down and started moving with her feet and she wasn't

806
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
 wearing any underwear.

807
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,140
 So she just was flashing Penn and Teller.

808
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
 Yeah.

809
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,140
 Yeah.

810
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:45,180
 That sounds like they're out there with a private show and they were like, what a great

811
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
 profession we have.

812
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,860
 What an odd job we have chosen for ourselves.

813
00:34:51,860 --> 00:35:01,380
 So they both wrote me privately to let me know I was a genius.

814
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
 Great job, buddy.

815
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,780
 Oh, I got to tell you my music thing.

816
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,740
 I've been on a kick lately, full albums.

817
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:15,060
 So all I do when I run through an album now is I do a Google search or a chat GPT search,

818
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,500
 whatever search engine I've got, kind of most handy.

819
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,540
 And I ask like, what is the best album from, and I just pick a random decade or year or

820
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
 whatever.

821
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,380
 And then I listen to that full album.

822
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,000
 But it's always an album that was made to be a complete album.

823
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 So like this week, I've listened to Elton John, Yellow Brick Road, and yesterday I just

824
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 finished Purple Rain.

825
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,780
 I just finished the Purple Rain album.

826
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,060
 And holy fuck, Prince is really good.

827
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
 What?

828
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
 Breaking news?

829
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
 Yeah.

830
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
 Prince is really good at this.

831
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,060
 I knew it.

832
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,060
 I knew what he was doing.

833
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:57,940
 Like when doves cry, go listen to when doves cry, do yourself a favor, listen to when doves

834
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,220
 cry, and it's a perfect song.

835
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,700
 The reason it's so ubiquitous is it's just fucking perfect.

836
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,940
 Yeah, he's really, really good.

837
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,840
 It is one of those things where it is worth a re-listen for those things.

838
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:19,720
 And you're right, Jacob, I will take you up on that because he was so popular that like

839
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,900
 you understood music to be that.

840
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,820
 Like for instance, that my kids started listening to Michael Jackson's music, which is just

841
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,040
 no inner conflict there.

842
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,980
 But the thing is like, you're like, oh, he really just had like, his voice honestly is

843
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,780
 like it's unique and it's okay.

844
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,340
 It's not amazing, right?

845
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:45,420
 But he had two superpowers that he could dance his face off, really believe in dancing, and

846
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:55,020
 his ear for sounds is just the actual composition of sounds and music is that.

847
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:00,980
 So I think like I got distracted because someone put my website in the chat.

848
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
 I don't know why.

849
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
 Oh, that was me, sorry.

850
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,420
 In the chat, somebody was asking where they could find dates for your show, so I put your

851
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
 website up.

852
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
 Oh yeah, I haven't updated it.

853
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,500
 You got to go to my Instagram for the updated dates, but I got to update it.

854
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,260
 My next dates are, and this is really important, Scoopfest, then we're going on a bunch of

855
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,380
 cruise ships, and then I'm going to be in Sparta, New Jersey.

856
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,540
 Sparta.

857
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:34,220
 On October 17th, doing two shows there, and then yeah, and then after that, there'll be

858
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,460
 a special show in October that we haven't announced yet, but I'll announce after Scoopfest.

859
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
 Yes.

860
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,340
 Because it evolves palmatically.

861
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,460
 And what else?

862
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:52,060
 I think, I think, I'm about to enter cruise ship season, which is why I'm being, this

863
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,660
 is, I'm going to do a bunch of cruise ships through the holidays.

864
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,260
 Cruise ships through the holidays?

865
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,580
 I'll be back in San Antonio.

866
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,580
 Okay.

867
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,780
 The third, November 3rd through the 8th.

868
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:11,580
 But the big thing, I've been making a big stick, because then come the turn of the year,

869
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,780
 Jokers of Magic is going back out on tour, and when all those dates are locked in, that's

870
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,100
 going to be at the start of the new year.

871
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,980
 There'll be two different tours, one in January and one in March, and we'll be all over the

872
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,620
 place, and I will be pumping those dates a ton, because that's the show I want to be

873
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,620
 doing.

874
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
 Right.

875
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
 Yes.

876
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
 That show is awesome.

877
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,380
 If you didn't get to see the first run, it is such a fun show.

878
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:41,220
 Anyhow, I want to go back and listen to those Prince albums, because I actually want to

879
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:47,100
 understand that these sounds didn't really exist, because I just, I grew up with those

880
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,380
 being music, and so you're like, "Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good," but I think it's so cool

881
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,700
 to go back and really hear the sounds and the tones of the instrumentation of those

882
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
 songs.

883
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,260
 So I'm listening to the Purple Rain album, and Darling Nikki is one of the songs on there,

884
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:16,340
 and it's all about a woman masturbating in a hotel lobby, and then has sex with her,

885
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,300
 and then she invites him to come back, and it's all this stuff.

886
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,660
 He's Shakespeare, right?

887
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,660
 You find the core stories of the American Dream.

888
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:30,100
 It was revolutionary at the time, because it was very female-forward, very woman-empowered.

889
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,440
 She's taking control of her own sexuality.

890
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,300
 She has him come up for a one-night stand.

891
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
 Oh, yeah.

892
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
 No, she's in charge.

893
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,860
 In the song, she is fully in charge.

894
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,500
 She rocks him with everything in the book.

895
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,860
 She's got the whips, the chains, the whole secret room thing, and then she's out the

896
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,400
 door before he's even awake and just leaves a note, "Kissy, kissy, you want to do it

897
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,500
 again sometime?

898
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
 Let me know."

899
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,220
 "Hit me up next time you want to grind."

900
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,980
 Yeah, and she's just like, she's out.

901
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,260
 So it was very female-forward and very empowering.

902
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,220
 The end of that song has some of the backwards stuff on there, so if you listen to Darling

903
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:09,340
 Nikki, at the end of it, it is something being played in reverse on the track.

904
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,140
 So I was out walking, listening to Darling Nikki, and I texted a buddy of mine, Andy,

905
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:21,740
 who is previously the president of the official Prince fan club.

906
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,620
 He has every piece of music that Prince has ever released, and then every piece of music

907
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,400
 that he can get his hands on, bootlegs, all that kind of stuff.

908
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,560
 So I texted him and said, "Hey, I'm listening to Purple Rain, listening to Darling Nikki.

909
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,500
 What is the backwards part at the end of Darling Nikki?"

910
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
 Because I knew he would just…

911
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
 I was like, "Andy will just know this.

912
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
 He'll know it off the top of his head.

913
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,800
 He won't even have to look it up."

914
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
 So he texts me back.

915
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
 He said…

916
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
 I have this in my head.

917
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
 You know what?

918
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
 What is it, Paul?

919
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 Do you know what it is?

920
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,520
 It's something to the effect of, "Thank you, friends, for listening to this.

921
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,480
 We hope you enjoyed the song," kind of thing.

922
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,140
 It's weirder than that.

923
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
 What does it say?

924
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
 It is, "Hello.

925
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,140
 How are you?

926
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,540
 I'm fine, 'cause I know the Lord is coming soon."

927
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
 Oh, Lord?

928
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,540
 "Coming soon."

929
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
 Oh, no.

930
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,540
 Well, he was deep in that…

931
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,060
 Because remember, Prince was super religious as well.

932
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,060
 He was.

933
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,060
 Yeah.

934
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,060
 I would…

935
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
 I'm still…

936
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,940
 There's a ton of stuff at the end of a bunch of these songs, including like Purple

937
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,260
 Rain, When Doves Cry, all this stuff.

938
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,200
 There's a lot of really Jesus-y stuff in there too, and it is…

939
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,260
 It's a little weird, but it's also kind of like a glimpse into Prince, and I'm kind

940
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,020
 of enjoying that part as well.

941
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,620
 I wish we could have gotten that Kevin Smith documentary.

942
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,700
 Yeah, and then the other one is on the shelf too, right?

943
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
 Yeah.

944
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:43,540
 And then there was another one that anyone who's seen it says is amazing, but it got

945
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,260
 held up by the dumbest legal technicality.

946
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,260
 Right.

947
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
 Yeah.

948
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,260
 They said they were going to make a six…

949
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,460
 They signed the contracts for a six-episode documentary, and the guy who made it said,

950
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,500
 "No, it needs a seventh episode," and because I went to a seventh episode, the Prince part

951
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,460
 of the production team got to say, "You broke contract.

952
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
 No one gets to see it."

953
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
 Awful.

954
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
 Yeah.

955
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
 Yeah.

956
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,700
 Well, this would be my recommendation, Matt, for you, MC Chris Friends.

957
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
 Okay.

958
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:19,700
 It's an EP, so it's a quick listen, and it's all Batman and Robin, so I think you'll

959
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
 like it.

960
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
 All right.

961
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:47,460
 I will give it a listen.

962
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460
 Cool.

963
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,420
 All right, friends, it is me, Guillermo del Toro, I have tried my best to make a Evangelion

964
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,020
 live-action film, but of course, many things got in the way of my production, not the least

965
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,060
 of which, just trying to make giant robots.

966
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,060
 It's tough.

967
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,560
 So what I decided to do, take a much of the pre-production material from that and go ahead

968
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,660
 and make my own Kaiju film, and I did, and what I have created is the Pacific Rim, but

969
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,780
 now I have the two of the films under the belt.

970
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:22,500
 I had the guy doing the thing from Lost in the Gang of Mean People, Dangerous People

971
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
 Show.

972
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,380
 Lost in the Gang of Mean People, yeah.

973
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,780
 The Gang of Mean People Show.

974
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,100
 So I got the Gang of Dangerous People Show, man, who do the movie, and I'm like, "Ah,

975
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
 that's okay."

976
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,820
 But now I realize the money is in the pornography.

977
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,460
 So I say, "Okay, let's go," and I want to do this the right way, so I am bringing

978
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,020
 Yena Yemisin out of retirement, yes, and Yena Yemisin.

979
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,020
 Who?

980
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,020
 Yena Yemisin.

981
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,020
 Who?

982
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,020
 Yena Yemisin.

983
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,020
 Yeah.

984
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,020
 No, it's all right.

985
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,020
 Who?

986
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,020
 Her name is Yena Yemisin.

987
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
 You say Yena?

988
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
 Yena Yemisin.

989
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,020
 I'm sorry.

990
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
 Oh!

991
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,940
 I hear, "Yes, I am a saint."

992
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,940
 Is that what you hear?

993
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,940
 Hold on, hold on.

994
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,940
 Let me look this up.

995
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,940
 Oh, no, no.

996
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,940
 I'm sorry.

997
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,940
 I have a pronunciation all messed up.

998
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,660
 I may say, "Beladonna."

999
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:16,180
 Okay, so Beladonna is going to do this new movie, and she is going to do what is going

1000
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,020
 to be called, "Specific Rim."

1001
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,980
 Yeah.

1002
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:30,060
 One specific rim that she wants to get her tongue on, and it's the Charlie Mann from

1003
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:36,540
 the, "I Got the Gang of Bean People" movie, and so the whole movie about her in a haunted

1004
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,340
 house trying to find one specific rim.

1005
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,380
 And you see-

1006
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,140
 Enter eight scopes of check-out.

1007
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,140
 Yeah, no robots.

1008
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,580
 Oh, there's a robot, a double-headed robot.

1009
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,580
 Well, okay.

1010
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,900
 Tell me what I did.

1011
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,660
 I guess some of these new dildos do have AI.

1012
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,540
 That has to be true, right?

1013
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,980
 There have to be sex toys with AI by now, right?

1014
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:06,300
 No, but I guess technically, you can't call it a dildo if it has technical parts, right?

1015
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,900
 I think so.

1016
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,900
 Yes.

1017
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,900
 Yes, Mr. Deltoro.

1018
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,900
 I believe that is true.

1019
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,900
 Look, I am not a dildo expert.

1020
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,900
 It seems like you are.

1021
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,900
 Wink.

1022
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,900
 Wink.

1023
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,900
 No, no.

1024
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,900
 My name is Jacob.

1025
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,900
 I am of course a dildo expert.

1026
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
 Benicio Deltoro.

1027
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,900
 Dildo expert.

1028
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
 I mean, look at Benicio Deltoro.

1029
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,900
 Guillermo Deltoro.

1030
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
 Look up the definition of Guillermo Deltoro.

1031
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,900
 Oh, excuse me.

1032
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,900
 Sorry.

1033
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,900
 Guillermo.

1034
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,900
 Benicio Deltoro.

1035
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
 Not that hack.

1036
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,220
 Not that dildo expert.

1037
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,980
 Scoop Jesus's artificial intelligence.

1038
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
 Yes.

1039
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,980
 Mmm.

1040
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,980
 The AI inside.

1041
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,980
 Guillermo Deltoro.

1042
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,980
 Say that again?

1043
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:52,980
 He's selling a bunch of his old movie props.

1044
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,980
 Is he really?

1045
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,980
 Yes.

1046
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,340
 I don't know if it's an existential thing or he's just trying to make some room for

1047
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,340
 stuff.

1048
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,340
 I don't know.

1049
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,040
 I don't know if it's an existential thing or he's just trying to make some room for

1050
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,040
 stuff.

1051
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
 Because he's got a lot of shit.

1052
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
 Right.

1053
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,740
 Have you seen anything that you want?

1054
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,740
 Oh my God.

1055
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,660
 I mean, not really because horror collectibles aren't my thing.

1056
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,660
 All right.

1057
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,940
 But, you know, one or two pieces would be kind of cool.

1058
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,940
 No, I mean, I'm really happy.

1059
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,980
 I actually already bought something from his.

1060
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
 Oh, really, man?

1061
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,980
 What did you get?

1062
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
 I got a case of snappy dialogue.

1063
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
 Oh, it's so snappy.

1064
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
 Yeah.

1065
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,720
 Guillermo del Toro's snappy dialogue.

1066
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,220
 I tried to open up the case and it was snap, snap, right shut.

1067
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,220
 Too snappy.

1068
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,220
 Too snappy.

1069
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,220
 Too snappy.

1070
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,420
 You know, is there a horror memorabilia thing that either of you would really want from

1071
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,300
 old horror films or either of you old horror hits?

1072
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,780
 I'd want the giant pot of boiling water from sleepaway camp.

1073
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,780
 That's what I would guess.

1074
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,780
 Oh, really?

1075
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,780
 Oh.

1076
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,460
 That got the big fat guy?

1077
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,580
 They got the big fat guy and he holds up his burning arms.

1078
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,580
 Yeah.

1079
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,580
 That's where the whole.

1080
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,580
 It's all jellied out?

1081
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,580
 Yeah.

1082
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,340
 Oh, that movie's something else.

1083
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,140
 There was, there was a time when I was a teenager, I was probably like 15, 16 years old, where

1084
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,980
 I was so over horror movies.

1085
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,980
 I was just a kid.

1086
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,060
 I was like fucking horror movies.

1087
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,580
 They're not scary at all, but I would go see them because they would have naked teenagers

1088
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,580
 in them.

1089
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,580
 Oh, yeah.

1090
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,580
 And like after the first, what, half hour of the movie, I'd be like, well, they probably

1091
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,060
 aren't going to be any more naked teenagers.

1092
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,780
 I'm kind of done with this movie.

1093
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,780
 That.

1094
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,780
 Yes.

1095
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,020
 I mean, that's sort of the formula, right?

1096
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,020
 Yeah.

1097
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,020
 Yeah.

1098
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,420
 But I was not interested in watching the horror movie part at all.

1099
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,140
 It was just like the horror movie part, which to me was just boring and stupid.

1100
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,700
 Jacob, have you seen any of the "Terrifier" films?

1101
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,180
 I saw the first one.

1102
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,180
 Okay.

1103
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,180
 Yeah.

1104
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,180
 I watched it with Matt's kids.

1105
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,980
 I was going to say, I still want to do a "Terrifier 3" with Matt's kids.

1106
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,980
 They loved it.

1107
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,700
 "Terrifier 3" with Matt's kids would be like a big Patreon level.

1108
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:02,180
 I just, I just bid on eBay for a cracked sidewalk that was the path of death's design.

1109
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,980
 So when it was, when it was cracking through the streets, I got, I got that crack there.

1110
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,900
 Someone has to have Freddy Krueger's, Freddy Krueger's glove, right?

1111
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,420
 Oh, there's, that has to be.

1112
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,420
 Yeah.

1113
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,420
 There's a couple of those.

1114
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,940
 Cause they, they did it different for a couple of the movies, right?

1115
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,940
 Yeah.

1116
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,620
 The movies went on long enough that there's a Freddy Krueger, and I bet Robert England

1117
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,300
 has one in his personal collection.

1118
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,300
 Probably a few.

1119
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,300
 Yeah.

1120
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,860
 Like the classic stuff, uh, like, like Freddy Krueger's stuff, uh, I'm talking like even

1121
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,460
 for like, he's collecting all the hammer horror stuff.

1122
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,940
 Like he's got like old Wolfman and Bella Lugosi shit.

1123
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,660
 I would love any of that stuff, like the, like the classic horror stuff.

1124
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,980
 Any of that stuff would, would, I'd, I'd display that very happily in my house.

1125
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,140
 Uh, like the pinhead stuff.

1126
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,220
 Hellraiser, I was a big Hellraiser fan of those early movies and everything.

1127
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,220
 Yeah.

1128
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,300
 There's probably some stuff that I'd like.

1129
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,620
 I, uh, yeah, they had a replica.

1130
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,820
 Um, that's actually when you watch Penn and Teller do needles, it's actually pulling the

1131
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,700
 pins from pinhead out of Teller's mouth.

1132
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
 Oh God.

1133
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,700
 Oh, that's, it is though.

1134
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,700
 Those are pinheads.

1135
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
 I've always wondered.

1136
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,700
 I, yeah.

1137
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,700
 Oh, good old pinhead.

1138
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,700
 Yeah.

1139
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,700
 That's right.

1140
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:19,900
 Cause he takes the pins, he takes the needles out and puts them in like a, I think I might

1141
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,300
 be conflating Teller's version of this with a bunch of other people's versions of this,

1142
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,140
 but does he take, does he take the needles out and put them in like a lemon or something

1143
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,140
 or a pincushion?

1144
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,100
 He takes them out of an apple to start.

1145
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,100
 That's what it is.

1146
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,100
 It's an apple.

1147
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
 Yeah.

1148
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,020
 He eats them from the apple and then he pulls them out.

1149
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,300
 Uh, so he could have like a little, instead of an apple, he could just have a little pinhead

1150
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,620
 prop and then he could just be taking the needles out of pinhead's head, I guess.

1151
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,620
 That would be, yeah.

1152
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,620
 That's nice.

1153
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,140
 I'm a, I'm going to send him a DM right now.

1154
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,540
 Teller, I have a note, I have a note on needles for you.

1155
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,540
 What's that thing called?

1156
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,020
 I have a note on your oldest, best, whatever.

1157
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,020
 What's the name of the puzzle box for the Hellraiser?

1158
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,020
 It's got a name.

1159
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,020
 Oh, it does.

1160
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,020
 Nepronomicon.

1161
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,580
 It's something like, it's something like the paint, the, the paint-a-cron or something

1162
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,260
 like that, the Lament Configuration.

1163
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,260
 Thank you, Steve Jasper.

1164
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,940
 Uh, Teller's street show, by the way, that, I don't think he's performed a trick more

1165
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,940
 than needles.

1166
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,940
 Uh, uh.

1167
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,940
 Has to be.

1168
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,340
 His most, his most performed trick.

1169
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,340
 Yeah.

1170
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,360
 That's what, he has a little, he had a little mat and he says, the show will begin when

1171
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,700
 all the needles are in the apple and he put out his mat and his little table and he just

1172
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,900
 starts sticking needles into an apple and that's when people, that's how people would

1173
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,940
 gather around him when he's a street performer.

1174
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,940
 Right.

1175
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,940
 When he's out gathering.

1176
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,940
 Yeah.

1177
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,620
 Just, who's this guy putting needles into an apple and what's going, what's about to

1178
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,620
 happen here?

1179
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,620
 Yes.

1180
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,620
 That's pretty good.

1181
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,620
 Yeah.

1182
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,620
 Yeah.

1183
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,620
 Yeah.

1184
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,620
 Yeah.

1185
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,620
 Andy Cheek asking if I have any movie props.

1186
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,620
 I don't have any official movie props.

1187
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,260
 I've got a lightsaber, but it's not, you know, a real lightsaber exactly.

1188
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,980
 So I would like to have a real lightsaber.

1189
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,500
 Do you have any?

1190
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
 Director's cut.

1191
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,220
 So you know, so you do have some actual screen used, uh, movie props.

1192
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,220
 Yeah.

1193
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
 That's cool.

1194
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
 Somewhere.

1195
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,220
 Yeah.

1196
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,220
 It counts.

1197
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,220
 It counts.

1198
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,220
 Oh, some big stuff.

1199
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
 I don't know.

1200
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,220
 I've got some stuff around here somewhere.

1201
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,220
 I just don't know what I have.

1202
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,220
 I don't know.

1203
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,220
 I have Judy Gau's ruby slippers.

1204
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,220
 Oh, that's nice.

1205
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,220
 I think I have, uh, in my house somewhere, I think I have a cane that FDR used.

1206
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,220
 That's probably my best prop is that.

1207
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,220
 That's definitely your best one.

1208
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,220
 It's right where it is.

1209
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,220
 FDR's cane.

1210
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1211
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1212
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1213
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1214
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1215
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1216
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1217
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,220
 I'm going to go with that.

1218
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:39,620
 I'm going to go with that.

1219
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:44,620
 For people who don't know, Matt does actually have a cane that FDR used.

1220
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,900
 After it was in a show in the episodes where we joked that it was FDR's cane, we found

1221
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,620
 out after the fact that it was FDR's cane.

1222
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,620
 That's really weird.

1223
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,380
 That's a really weird series of events.

1224
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,300
 And it was used in the show as FDR's cane.

1225
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,300
 Yes.

1226
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,580
 That's some weird shit.

1227
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:04,800
 It was an old cane from "Grandma Ruby's House."

1228
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
 That's the funniest thing.

1229
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
 We just talked about this for what?

1230
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
 Five minutes?

1231
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
 Yeah.

1232
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,780
 I am surrounded by Ruby Keeler stuff.

1233
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,780
 Of course.

1234
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,780
 Yeah.

1235
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,020
 You've got tons of film use props.

1236
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,020
 Yeah.

1237
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,780
 I'm lousy with Ruby Keeler stuff.

1238
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,780
 So yeah.

1239
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,900
 You have a Hollywood Walk of Fame on your wife's family tree.

1240
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,900
 Yeah.

1241
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,820
 You know what happened to that giant typewriter she danced on?

1242
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,820
 No.

1243
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,820
 Oh, I've got that.

1244
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,820
 I'm using it right now.

1245
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,820
 That is something.

1246
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:40,220
 I should have pitched this to the people who work behind the scenes at Spiegel World because

1247
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:47,900
 they put these different events and shows together, but I thought that Spiegel World

1248
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,980
 should get Sean and John together with my wife and reenact the tap dancing on the typewriter

1249
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,980
 bit.

1250
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,980
 Oh, wow.

1251
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,980
 Yeah.

1252
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:02,580
 That typewriter prop was ... If you don't know what we're talking about, you can YouTube

1253
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:08,420
 Ruby Keeler dancing on a typewriter, and it's a famous movie musical bit.

1254
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:13,580
 It's from the movie, the 1937 film, "Ready, Willing, and Able."

1255
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:18,740
 After its use in the film, the typewriter became part of the film's production design

1256
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,380
 and is now considered a piece of movie memorabilia, even though its current location is not known.

1257
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,380
 Yeah.

1258
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,380
 I bet that just got-

1259
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,380
 I mean, back in those days, it was-

1260
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,460
 I'm assuming it got taken apart in these projects.

1261
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1262
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,780
 Even just recently, even through the '90s, stuff just got trashed, man.

1263
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,780
 Oh, yeah.

1264
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,100
 Well, a lot of stuff gets reused, broken down and reused for different things.

1265
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,100
 Right.

1266
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,100
 Sometimes, yeah, but-

1267
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,460
 Yeah, if you can reuse it, they're breaking it down and reusing it for the next thing.

1268
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,460
 A lot of times, people just throw shit away, man.

1269
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,020
 Especially in the movie, the studio era.

1270
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,220
 Yes.

1271
00:53:53,220 --> 00:54:02,100
 Is it true or is it false that the Falkor is the animal skin in "Dumb and Dumber"?

1272
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,100
 That was a rumor.

1273
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,200
 I don't know if that was actually true.

1274
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,580
 I don't think that was actually the- But they might have repurposed part of him for the

1275
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,580
 mutthut truck.

1276
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,580
 Yeah.

1277
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,100
 That's what I kept hearing as a rumor.

1278
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,100
 It might have been.

1279
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
 It might have been repurposed and-

1280
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,100
 I don't think it was.

1281
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,100
 I don't think it was.

1282
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,100
 It feels too good to be true.

1283
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,100
 Yeah.

1284
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,940
 It's not quite the same fur either.

1285
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,940
 Right.

1286
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,940
 Yeah.

1287
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940
 Yeah.

1288
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,100
 Google says, "No.

1289
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
 Not used there."

1290
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,100
 Yeah.

1291
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,100
 Yeah.

1292
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:38,860
 But, yeah, it was a good thing because it wasn't close in time, was it?

1293
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,860
 The never-ending story-

1294
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,860
 No.

1295
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,860
 It was a long way off.

1296
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,860
 Was much earlier, right?

1297
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:49,100
 In fact, I do believe, I remember just a couple years ago, someone actually still has Falkor

1298
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,620
 in their barn somewhere.

1299
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,220
 Like kind of rotting away.

1300
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,220
 Half-rotten.

1301
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,220
 Oh.

1302
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,220
 Yeah.

1303
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,220
 Slower fall.

1304
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,220
 That's too sexy.

1305
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,220
 Yeah.

1306
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,220
 Like, the way that-

1307
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,220
 Show me that half-rotten Falkor.

1308
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,660
 Have you seen those fucking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle heads from the Henson designs?

1309
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,220
 Oh, yeah.

1310
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,220
 Nowadays?

1311
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,220
 Yes.

1312
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,220
 They look-

1313
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,220
 I have a friend who worked on the construction of those.

1314
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,220
 Oh, wow.

1315
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,220
 They look crazy now.

1316
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,220
 Yeah.

1317
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,220
 That's insane.

1318
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,220
 Right.

1319
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:28,220
 NECA made a line of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cross-universal monsters because they had both

1320
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,220
 those licenses.

1321
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,220
 Mm-hmm.

1322
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,780
 This was like two years ago.

1323
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,060
 They made, you know, figures of the turtles as monsters.

1324
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:40,980
 They had like Leo as Frankenstein and I think Raphael was a vampire.

1325
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,420
 They made Michelangelo a mummy, right?

1326
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,420
 Okay.

1327
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:53,940
 And they based his head sculpt design off of the rotting mask of the one that was used

1328
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,940
 in the movies.

1329
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,940
 Oh, jeez.

1330
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,940
 It looks very much like-

1331
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,940
 Oh, jeez.

1332
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,940
 It's really cool.

1333
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,940
 It's really cool.

1334
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,940
 It looks kind of skeletal.

1335
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,940
 It's wild.

1336
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,660
 If you look up, you know, rotten Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle head-

1337
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,820
 The people on the Zoom, we're about to see it right now.

1338
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,820
 Yeah.

1339
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:09,820
 No, I know.

1340
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:16,060
 We're talking with a puppeteer, Tim Lagasse, who is big in the puppet world.

1341
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,080
 He's the one who taught that puppet workshop to my kids.

1342
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,940
 And he basically says that like, you know, all the material that goes into puppets eventually

1343
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,940
 rots.

1344
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,940
 Yes.

1345
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,940
 Right.

1346
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,580
 Even like sponge and stuff like that, like sponge will just dry out and become dust.

1347
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,580
 Exactly.

1348
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,580
 Yep.

1349
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,340
 So you always have to update stuff.

1350
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,580
 And Jacob just showed me some pictures that looked horrible.

1351
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,580
 That looked really scary.

1352
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,580
 Yeah.

1353
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,580
 Yeah, yeah.

1354
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,100
 And you're just running away and then you have the teeth in there and they don't run

1355
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,100
 away.

1356
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,940
 And if you look up NECA Michelangelo mummy figure-

1357
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:51,660
 My search history is already weird enough, I'm fine.

1358
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,100
 It's basically that same head.

1359
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,460
 Also leading up to ScoopFest, boy do my Amazon recommendations get weird fast.

1360
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,460
 Yes.

1361
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1362
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,780
 As I buy things on Amazon for ScoopFest, my recommendations get real weird real quick.

1363
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,660
 But most of the time you're just searching on the site jackable.com, right?

1364
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,260
 That's right, that's right.

1365
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,260
 Cookies un-gaged.

1366
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:17,700
 Turn them cookies on, time to jack it.

1367
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,220
 Speaking of jacking it, it's time for Jock Versus Nerd.

1368
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,220
 Winner gets the jacket.

1369
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,220
 Right here on Switch.

1370
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,220
 Jock Versus Nerd action.

1371
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,220
 Who am I?

1372
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,220
 Oh boy.

1373
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:38,420
 It's exactly, it's exactly that Rotten Smash.

1374
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,420
 On the hunt for balls.

1375
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,980
 No, Rotten Michelangelo.

1376
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,260
 We got a Scooperty today from Scoopy Logic, Scoopy Logic sent this one in a couple of

1377
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,260
 years ago.

1378
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:53,100
 I've gone back into the old Wayback machine here and found this Scooperty that Scoopy

1379
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,260
 Logic sent in I think in 2023.

1380
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:03,540
 Anyway, the categories are not only a Fruit, Deals of a Lifetime, TMNT, very coincidental

1381
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,540
 there, and Hodgepodge.

1382
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,540
 Oh neat, I love it.

1383
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,540
 I'm up first.

1384
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,540
 We got some TMNT.

1385
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,420
 I'll try TMNT for 200, let's see.

1386
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:15,740
 This actor voiced Shredder in the original cartoon series will accept his best known

1387
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,740
 role.

1388
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,740
 Oh cool.

1389
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,260
 Oh, I have zero idea.

1390
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,260
 I have to pass.

1391
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,860
 This is Philip Seymour Hoffman.

1392
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,860
 No.

1393
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,500
 Famously Philip Seymour Hoffman.

1394
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,900
 Paul, who is it?

1395
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,900
 It's the guy who played Uncle Phil on The Fresh Prince.

1396
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,900
 Oh, interesting.

1397
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
 That's right.

1398
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
 I did know that.

1399
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
 James Avery.

1400
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,900
 Yes.

1401
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,900
 Matt.

1402
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,100
 If that's the $200 question, forget about it.

1403
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,220
 I know, right?

1404
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:51,780
 I will do not only a Fruit for 200.

1405
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,780
 A berry.

1406
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,780
 This tropical fruit naturally grows in bundles.

1407
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,740
 It's better than naturally growing in bindles.

1408
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,100
 Right, right, right.

1409
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,580
 Only hobos eat this berry.

1410
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,660
 I don't know.

1411
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,660
 Pass.

1412
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,660
 Paul.

1413
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,660
 Bananas.

1414
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,660
 Bananas.

1415
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,660
 It's a banana.

1416
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,660
 It's technically a berry.

1417
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,660
 That's right.

1418
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,660
 It's technically a berry.

1419
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,660
 Paul is technically in the lead.

1420
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
 Paul, you're up.

1421
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,660
 TMNT, please.

1422
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,660
 For 400.

1423
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:24,300
 The multicolored masks were established in the original cartoon.

1424
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,700
 What color did they all wear previously in the comics?

1425
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,700
 Red.

1426
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,700
 Damn it.

1427
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,700
 I knew that one.

1428
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,700
 Red.

1429
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,700
 I should have done.

1430
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,700
 I should have gone there.

1431
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,940
 Paul out with a commanding lead right now.

1432
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,100
 800 to 0 to 0.

1433
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,820
 Baton Rouge.

1434
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,980
 Baton Red.

1435
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,540
 I'm just getting the basics, though.

1436
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,340
 We got, you know, just getting the simple questions.

1437
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,340
 All right.

1438
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,340
 All right.

1439
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,900
 You have to smack talk with your lead, buddy.

1440
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,900
 Yeah.

1441
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,900
 We'll see.

1442
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,900
 We'll see.

1443
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,900
 I'll try TMNT.

1444
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,900
 Try to steal one from Paul for 600.

1445
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,900
 Here we go.

1446
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,440
 This TV producer is credited with writing the classic theme song.

1447
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,440
 I don't fucking know.

1448
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,440
 Matt.

1449
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,440
 God damn it.

1450
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,440
 Stevie Wonder.

1451
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,440
 No.

1452
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
 I don't know.

1453
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
 Stevie Wonder.

1454
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
 Paul.

1455
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,440
 Fred Wolf.

1456
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,440
 Chuck Lorre.

1457
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,440
 Oh, it's Chuck Lorre.

1458
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,440
 Okay.

1459
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,440
 Chuck Lorre.

1460
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,440
 Yeah.

1461
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
 And Paul's points are gone.

1462
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,440
 Matt.

1463
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
 I've got 200.

1464
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
 Hodgepodge.

1465
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:29,700
 James Bond creator Ian Fleming wrote this book that in 1968 was turned into a children's

1466
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,900
 movie starring Dick Van Dyke.

1467
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,460
 Hmm.

1468
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,460
 Deep Throat.

1469
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,460
 God.

1470
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:40,060
 Does it say, would you say Mary Poppins was starring Dick Van Dyke?

1471
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,060
 Probably not.

1472
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,060
 It was.

1473
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,060
 I mean, he was the...

1474
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,060
 Yeah.

1475
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,060
 He was one of the leads in that.

1476
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,060
 It was like the actual timeframe.

1477
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,060
 Yeah.

1478
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:52,380
 Oh, it's not it though, I don't think.

1479
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,380
 I think I know.

1480
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,380
 Passes to Paul.

1481
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,380
 Shitty, shitty, bang, bang.

1482
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,380
 Shitty, shitty, bang, bang is correct.

1483
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,380
 Cool.

1484
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,380
 Shitty, shitty, bad, bad.

1485
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,380
 Paul.

1486
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,380
 Shitty, shitty, bad, bad.

1487
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,380
 TMNT, please.

1488
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,380
 For 800.

1489
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,460
 According to Internet Conspiracy, what band was created after touring in a live action

1490
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:15,660
 TMNT concert series?

1491
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:21,180
 Oh man.

1492
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,620
 I don't know.

1493
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,620
 But I do know...

1494
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,620
 Come on, Paul.

1495
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,420
 You know this one.

1496
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:31,620
 Michael Ian Black was part of the promo team for The Turtle's Way back in the day.

1497
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,580
 I feel of great kinship with him doing costume work.

1498
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,580
 I'll pass.

1499
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,580
 I don't know.

1500
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,860
 You don't know about The Turtle's?

1501
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,980
 What band would you guess?

1502
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:40,980
 It's probably a boy band.

1503
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,980
 Probably...

1504
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,980
 No, it's The Turtle's.

1505
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
 No.

1506
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,980
 NKOTB, I bet.

1507
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,980
 I have no idea.

1508
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,980
 I'm passing.

1509
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,980
 Matt.

1510
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,460
 I bet the guess is New Kids.

1511
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,460
 Black Eyed Peas.

1512
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,460
 Oh, wow.

1513
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,460
 The Black Eyed Peas.

1514
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,500
 "Tonight's Gonna Be a Good Fight" was the original lyric.

1515
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,540
 Oh, yeah.

1516
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:02,500
 Let's get some pizza in here.

1517
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,620
 Let's get some pizza.

1518
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:10,980
 Let's get some pizza in here.

1519
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,800
 I'll try not only a fruit, a gourd.

1520
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,500
 The season is almost upon us.

1521
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,980
 Prepare for the olfactory overload.

1522
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,980
 Ah, yes.

1523
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,700
 Wait, what?

1524
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,220
 Oh, is it pumpkin or pumpkin spice or all those things?

1525
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,220
 Pumpkin.

1526
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,220
 Yeah, pumpkin.

1527
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,040
 It's pumpkin, pumpkin.

1528
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,060
 I don't know anything, huh?

1529
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,400
 Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

1530
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,400
 You know some things.

1531
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,260
 Let's go with Hodgepodge for 400.

1532
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:51,020
 This American actor accidentally killed two people while driving in Ireland in 1987.

1533
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,740
 This definitely tickles something in my brain.

1534
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,740
 I think it's in there somewhere.

1535
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,660
 I know, I'm trying to think, is it Robert Downey Jr.?

1536
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:04,020
 He got in a lot of trouble.

1537
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,020
 I don't know.

1538
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,020
 Pass.

1539
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,020
 Paul!

1540
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:12,500
 Um, his name is flying out of my head right now.

1541
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,700
 And into two people walking.

1542
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,780
 No, it's fucking Ferris Bueller.

1543
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,060
 Matthew, Matthew...

1544
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,060
 Damon.

1545
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,660
 Fuck, what is his name?

1546
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,660
 Matthew...

1547
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,660
 Sully.

1548
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,420
 Matthew Sullivan's Crossing.

1549
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:33,700
 Fuck, why can't I get his name?

1550
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,900
 It's going to be really funny if Paul's just doing a gamesmanship here to try to get me

1551
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,900
 to say his name.

1552
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
 I can't get his name.

1553
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,900
 I can't get his name.

1554
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,580
 I can't, it won't come to me.

1555
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,580
 Matthew...shit.

1556
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,580
 Harry.

1557
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,580
 No, pass.

1558
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,020
 I can't get his name.

1559
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,020
 Matthew Broderick, Paul?

1560
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,020
 There you go.

1561
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,020
 That's it.

1562
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,020
 I'll try Matthew Broderick.

1563
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,020
 I could not get it.

1564
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,020
 I'll try Matthew Broderick.

1565
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,660
 No, you could not get his name.

1566
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,660
 Paul!

1567
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,780
 Uh, Hodgepodge for $600, please.

1568
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:08,860
 Children's book author Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay for which James Bond movie?

1569
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,860
 Oh, boy.

1570
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,260
 James and the Giant Spy.

1571
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,180
 That's a...

1572
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,180
 I'll pass.

1573
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,180
 I don't know.

1574
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,660
 Pass this to me.

1575
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:25,100
 I'm trying to think of like, what are the weirder James Bond movies?

1576
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,020
 Like Octopussy is a weird one.

1577
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,300
 That one's all set with like a circus troupe and stuff.

1578
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,300
 Yeah.

1579
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:38,260
 There are some weird ones out there.

1580
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,420
 I guess I'll pass.

1581
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,260
 Matt?

1582
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,300
 That is James Bond, of course, Sleeping Foot to Face.

1583
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:51,780
 I bet it was Dr. No, but I don't know.

1584
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,380
 I don't know at all.

1585
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,500
 Dr. No was the first Bond movie.

1586
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
 Was it?

1587
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,980
 You Only Live Twice.

1588
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,580
 You Only Live Twice.

1589
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,780
 I think that's the one where...

1590
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:09,420
 I think You Only Live Twice is the Sean Connery one where he does Yellow Face.

1591
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,420
 Yes.

1592
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:15,220
 I think he dresses up as a Japanese man in that movie.

1593
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,220
 It's me.

1594
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,340
 It's my Deals of a Lifetime, 200.

1595
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,340
 It's a B.

1596
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:25,740
 In 2007, this creative team negotiated for 50% of all digital rights for their show and

1597
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,380
 have made almost $1 billion since.

1598
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,300
 Wow.

1599
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:37,180
 Creative team negotiated for 50% of all digital rights of their show.

1600
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,180
 What was this category?

1601
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,180
 Deal of a Lifetime.

1602
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,180
 Oh.

1603
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,140
 So these are smart people who made a really smart deal.

1604
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,540
 Yeah.

1605
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,620
 I have no idea.

1606
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,260
 I guess I'll pass.

1607
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,700
 Matt.

1608
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,580
 I think this is Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

1609
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,800
 Oh, that would make sense.

1610
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
 I think you're right.

1611
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
 Good call.

1612
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,380
 It is Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

1613
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,380
 Well done.

1614
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,380
 Matt.

1615
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,380
 I knew a thing.

1616
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,740
 Look at you go.

1617
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,100
 Boy, they must be.

1618
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,100
 They are cleaning up.

1619
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,100
 Clearly.

1620
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,100
 Yeah.

1621
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,500
 You heard it here first, folks.

1622
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,180
 Trey Parker and Matt Stone doing fine.

1623
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,740
 The reference to that, if you watched them, they're funny.

1624
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,740
 They are.

1625
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,740
 They are.

1626
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,500
 Deals of a Lifetime, 400, please.

1627
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:25,420
 Outside of the small pittance of merchandising and sequel rights, how much was George Lucas

1628
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:30,980
 paid to direct the Star Wars, the original Star Wars film, within $50,000?

1629
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,500
 Everyone knows he was paid with candy.

1630
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,500
 That's right.

1631
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,980
 I don't know.

1632
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,140
 Pass.

1633
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,740
 Paul.

1634
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:45,560
 How much was George Lucas paid?

1635
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,560
 It wasn't.

1636
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,240
 I don't even know if it was $100,000.

1637
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,240
 I'll pass.

1638
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,240
 I don't remember.

1639
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
 Yeah.

1640
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
 I mean, he can't have been paid much.

1641
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
 Do I need to guess?

1642
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
 Oh, no.

1643
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
 I'm in the lead.

1644
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
 I don't want to guess.

1645
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,240
 Pass.

1646
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,240
 $150,000.

1647
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
 Wow.

1648
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,740
 Paul would have gotten points if he had said $100,000.

1649
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,300
 I would direct Star Wars now for that money, just so you know.

1650
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,300
 Oh, OK.

1651
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,900
 I need $160,000 minimum.

1652
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,900
 I'm going to stand fast on that.

1653
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,900
 Paul.

1654
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,620
 I'll close out Hodgepodge.

1655
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,620
 For $800,000.

1656
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,620
 Daily double.

1657
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,620
 Here we go.

1658
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,620
 We finally found one.

1659
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:23,100
 Oh, now it's for the real deal.

1660
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:31,260
 Volkswagen's top selling product is not a vehicle, but iconically German food.

1661
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:36,300
 Wolf brand chili.

1662
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,060
 Well it's either a pretzel or a bratwurst.

1663
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,320
 Two bits.

1664
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,060
 I'll go pretzel.

1665
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,040
 A pretzel?

1666
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,060
 A currywurst sausage.

1667
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,060
 Oh.

1668
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:53,060
 A currywurst sauce-age.

1669
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,900
 Who would have accepted bratwurst?

1670
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,580
 If you had said currywurst, I would have accepted currywurst.

1671
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,580
 Yeah.

1672
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,580
 Currywurst.

1673
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,380
 I might have even accepted sausage.

1674
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,380
 It's me.

1675
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,820
 I'll try Deals of a Lifetime 600.

1676
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,700
 We got four questions left.

1677
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,940
 One daily double left.

1678
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:21,600
 In a 1986 antitrust lawsuit, the USFL, Donald Trump successfully sued the NFL, winning how

1679
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,860
 much money?

1680
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,860
 Hint.

1681
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,860
 Pick a number.

1682
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:32,820
 1 through 10.

1683
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,820
 I don't remember.

1684
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:34,820
 Next map.

1685
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:35,820
 A dollar.

1686
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,820
 $1.

1687
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,820
 $3.

1688
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,820
 Oh shoot.

1689
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,820
 $3.

1690
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:43,940
 I was ready to guess $1 too.

1691
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,660
 I watched the documentary.

1692
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,460
 They presented him with the check.

1693
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:56,540
 This is back when he wasn't who he is now, and so it was a very embarrassing moment.

1694
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:02,220
 Later on he would go on to prove that he wasn't capable of embarrassment, so there you go.

1695
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,060
 But very capable of vengeance, it turns out.

1696
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,060
 Yeah.

1697
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,060
 Holds a grudge for a while.

1698
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,060
 Yeah.

1699
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:10,460
 I'll go with Deals of a Lifetime to close it out.

1700
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,460
 Oh no, it's Matt's turn.

1701
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,460
 Great.

1702
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,460
 It's Matt's turn.

1703
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:18,340
 I need to make up some ground here, so I will steal Paul's question and do Deals of a Lifetime

1704
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,340
 for 800.

1705
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,340
 Daily double.

1706
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,660
 There you go.

1707
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,820
 Now you got it, Matt.

1708
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,820
 Paul with the gamesmanship.

1709
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:31,220
 Retired in 2001, this former NYMET receives a little over $1 million annually for every

1710
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,480
 July 1st until 2035.

1711
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,480
 Bobby Bonilla, baby.

1712
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,480
 Is that true?

1713
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,480
 Yeah.

1714
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,480
 Holy shit.

1715
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,480
 How did he do that?

1716
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,480
 Bobby Bonilla.

1717
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:49,380
 I have friends, my Mets friends, the day that it pays, they go, "It's happy Bobby Bonilla

1718
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,780
 Day," and it's the day that Bobby Bonilla is still being paid by the Mets.

1719
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,780
 What happened?

1720
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:59,060
 So basically they gave him a crazy contract to play baseball, which happens at baseball

1721
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:04,260
 more than any other sport, and then he ended up being so terrible, they wanted him to stop

1722
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,940
 playing, and there was no rules yet on stretch provisions, and so they basically, to not

1723
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:14,020
 hurt their salary cap or not hurt their bottom line or whatever, they asked if they could

1724
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:18,940
 stretch his contract out for whatever it was, like 27 years or something like that.

1725
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:22,500
 Anyone who got paid now is not even considered ridiculous, but back then it was a ridiculous

1726
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,780
 amount of money to play horribly for the Mets.

1727
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:29,140
 It's a ridiculous amount of money to not do anything.

1728
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,580
 Well, ask Kawhi Leonard.

1729
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,580
 Who's that?

1730
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,620
 Oh, you don't know about this one?

1731
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,780
 He's the man who's getting paid a ridiculous amount of money right now for not doing anything.

1732
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,340
 Made a really, really good ... If we did old school jock versus nerd, this would have been

1733
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:52,260
 the question of the week for sure, but Kawhi Leonard was paid $28 million to not show up

1734
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:58,220
 or do anything for this company that was a sponsor of the L.A. Clippers.

1735
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,700
 Oh, this was the way they got his ... It was like phantom salary.

1736
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:07,140
 Yes, it was to get around the salary cap, to give him an extra bonus money inside the

1737
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,140
 salary cap.

1738
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,340
 At least that's being investigated right now.

1739
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,140
 It's just blowing up now, right?

1740
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,820
 But it was supposed to be an environmental company, worried about reducing people's carbon

1741
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,820
 footprint.

1742
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:23,860
 The joke is that Kawhi Leonard never even tweeted or did anything, but what is Kawhi's

1743
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,860
 stance on people's carbon footprints?

1744
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,720
 Is he even passionate about it?

1745
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,720
 Who knows?

1746
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,720
 Who knows?

1747
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,420
 It's a weird, weird thing.

1748
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,420
 That's really funny.

1749
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:40,460
 It was first exposed nationally by Pablo Torre, which has a great podcast, Pablo Torre Explains

1750
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,460
 It All.

1751
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,460
 Yes.

1752
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:47,940
 Then Mark Cuban, I guess current part owner, but former majority owner of Mavericks, started

1753
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:48,940
 hitting up on Twitter.

1754
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:52,460
 He said, "Why don't you come on my show?"

1755
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:59,020
 They debated about who's at fault for this for two and a half hours.

1756
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:04,340
 They put an hour and 10 of it on air, and there's two people passionately arguing about

1757
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,500
 something, and there's no name calling.

1758
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,500
 No one gets called Hitler.

1759
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,500
 No one gets called the child molester.

1760
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,620
 No one is insulted.

1761
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:16,100
 It was an earnest debate where people kept their cool.

1762
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:20,420
 It's worth listening to just for that miracle, just because I didn't think people could still

1763
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,420
 do that.

1764
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:27,500
 Matt, just to be clear, you mean they edited all that stuff out, and that's in the full

1765
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,420
 version, but not in the part that they aired version, right?

1766
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,980
 They wouldn't have done all that arguing without calling each other Hitler and child molesters.

1767
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:34,980
 I know.

1768
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,140
 It's against the rules of basic conversation these days.

1769
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,140
 That's right.

1770
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,980
 I'm glad you didn't disagree with me right there, because I would have had to call you

1771
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,260
 Hitler.

1772
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,260
 Here's the craziest thing.

1773
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:56,060
 We've done so much crazy shit because of bullshit child molestation rumors that aren't true.

1774
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,020
 It's all because calling someone Hitler stopped working.

1775
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:03,140
 That used to be the worst thing you could do, and someone figured out that calling someone

1776
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,820
 child molester is worse than Hitler, and then that took over, and that really has created

1777
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:12,100
 a bunch of extra conspiracy theories that wouldn't have been otherwise.

1778
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:18,720
 Do you think that if it were released today, like if new evidence came out today that Hitler

1779
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,940
 himself was a child molester, do you think the pendulum would swing back to just calling

1780
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,060
 people Hitlers again?

1781
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:30,060
 Then I'd be like, "Life is a herald.

1782
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,300
 That's a perfect third beat of conspiracy theories."

1783
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,140
 That would be it right there.

1784
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:40,860
 Paul, you got not only a fruit for 600 or 800, you have negative 400 points, Matt has

1785
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:41,860
 400 points.

1786
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,860
 I have 800 points.

1787
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,060
 It's a very high-scoring game.

1788
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,140
 I'll try 800, please.

1789
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:53,060
 Not only a fruit for 800, according to the US Supreme Court, Nix V. Headon in 1993, it's

1790
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,060
 a vegetable.

1791
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,060
 1893.

1792
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,060
 Sorry, 1893.

1793
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,060
 Tomato.

1794
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:05,780
 So the US Supreme Court ruled that a tomato is a vegetable?

1795
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
 That's it.

1796
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,780
 It is.

1797
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:08,780
 It's a tax case.

1798
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,780
 Vegetables are not a botanical classification.

1799
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,380
 It's technically a fruit.

1800
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,140
 Yeah, you're technically a fruit, Hitler.

1801
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,340
 I'm not technically a fruit.

1802
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,340
 I'm just a fruit.

1803
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,340
 Okay.

1804
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,340
 La-dee-dah.

1805
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:27,740
 I'm closing out the category and the game, not only a fruit for 600, a composite fruit.

1806
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:35,860
 This misnamed fruit actually consists of many tiny individual fruits embedded in a fleshy

1807
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:36,860
 receptacle.

1808
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:37,860
 Oh.

1809
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,020
 I like me a composite fruit.

1810
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,020
 Let's go.

1811
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,980
 I like me a fleshy receptacle.

1812
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:55,440
 A composite fruit, this misnamed fruit actually consists of many tiny individual fruits embedded

1813
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,380
 in a fleshy receptacle.

1814
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,620
 Fleshy receptacle is really just not where I want to be in the day.

1815
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,620
 We are different people.

1816
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:04,620
 That was my high school band.

1817
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,620
 We are different people.

1818
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:10,540
 That was our number one single.

1819
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:15,220
 We open for the meat puppets.

1820
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,940
 And I mean that literally.

1821
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:20,820
 I guess I'll pass.

1822
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,660
 Matt, you can win with this.

1823
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:30,420
 Man, I don't even know if I have a guess for what a fleshy receptacle would be.

1824
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:35,620
 Fleshy receptacle, doo-doo-doo-doo.

1825
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,620
 I have a guess.

1826
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,620
 All right.

1827
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,620
 I'll pass to Paul.

1828
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,620
 Pass to Paul.

1829
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,620
 Pomegranate.

1830
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,620
 Pomegranate.

1831
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,620
 I bet you're right.

1832
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,620
 There we go.

1833
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:48,620
 No, it's a strawberry, raspberry, or blackberry.

1834
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:49,620
 Boo.

1835
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,620
 Boo earns.

1836
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:57,220
 I thought about strawberry, but I didn't think fleshy receptacle.

1837
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,060
 Fleshy receptacle threw me off.

1838
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,620
 That's the game I win today with 800 points.

1839
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,620
 Matt has 400.

1840
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:08,060
 Paul has a negative 200 after his fleshy receptacle mishap, and that is a scooperty from Scoopy

1841
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,060
 Logic.

1842
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,060
 Thank you, Scoopy Logic.

1843
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,220
 Like I said, Scoopy Logic sent that to us a couple of years ago, so if you want to send

1844
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:18,260
 us a scooperty, send us a Price is Skripe Jack vs. Nerd, send us an Obelisk Jack vs. Nerd,

1845
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,260
 send us some scoop mail.

1846
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:23,500
 You can do all those things over there at heyscoops.com, and today is evidence.

1847
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,940
 If I don't get to your scooperty when you send it in at first, I'll probably get to

1848
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,940
 it later.

1849
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,940
 Eventually.

1850
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:29,940
 It's coming.

1851
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,740
 I want to thank my favorite fleshy receptacle, Penn Jillette, for creating this podcast.

1852
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,740
 Yeah.

1853
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,740
 Thanks, Penn.

1854
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,380
 Of course, I want to thank all the people that make this show possible, who support

1855
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,820
 us on our Patreon.

1856
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:47,100
 These people all are writing on the new Powers comic book coming out next year.

1857
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,100
 Fantastic.

1858
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,100
 Circles and Circles.

1859
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:53,180
 Signature Curl Scoop, the micro scoop for shaping.

1860
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:58,620
 We all scream for Mark McLean, Unbanned Scoop, One Small Scoop for Man, a Ranch Slunk, a

1863

 J Hughes.

1864
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:19,340
 The following individuals all bob their heads vigorously while they listen to the podcast

1865
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,980
 in the hopes that someone will inquire as to what it might be that's causing them the

1866
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:27,340
 jam so hard and they try and get a successful obelisk off of it.

1867
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:34,180
 Bearded Scoop 3, Bear Scoop, BJ Joyer, Belgian Triple Scoop, Ben, Ben Dennis, Ben Gow, Ben

 The following people can be seen dancing in the video Jigging with the Devil by Sella

1872
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:57,980
 Van Halen.

1873
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:05,220
 And that would be Andrew Koenig, Andrew Ossichuk, Andy Cheek, Angela Chan, Angry Face Scoop,

1874
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:13,380
 Ant Foods, Anton Jernberg, Apple Scoop, Ameris Saar, Avin Zarlez, AWOL Scoop, Bad Pirate

1875
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:18,420
 Scoop, Bertie, Bert Vonk, Base Camp Scoops, and BB Hermit.

1876
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,420
 Sorry, yeah, I did, I said Boats and Scoop wrong again.

1877
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,020
 So Boats and Scoop, thank you Boats and Scoop.

1878
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,260
 Also, all of these people have realized, hey, Prince was incredibly good at what he did.

1879
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:38,020
 Brian Richard, Brooks Lyle, Brian McLeod, Brian Traves, Buster Kamikaze, Sea Wick,

 a weird bathroom story, head on over to fartsinabag.biz.

1903
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:45,300
 Honestly, just be part of the family.

1904
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,540
 We're just one big happy group here.

1905

 It's all about the family.

1907
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,300
 That's right, Bing.

1908
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,300
 Fast and Furious Family.

1909
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,300
 That's right, Bing.

1910
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:00,020
 All of his Bing Crosby impersonation are just perfect.

1911
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:03,700
 We're doing a heist just to show how much family matters to us.

1912
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,220
 How much family matters.

1913
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:08,260
 We rob people for the love of family.

1914
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:12,660
 That's right, come on out.

1915
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,900
 Look, Scoopfest is two weeks away, but we've got room for you.

1916
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,900
 You can still make that choice.

1917
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,900
 We do.

1918
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:18,900
 Go to scoopfest.com.

1919
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:24,860
 We're selling tickets every day right now, so yeah, we definitely have space for you.

1920
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,860
 Come on out.

1921
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,860
 It's going to be awesome.

1922
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,420
 Yeah, it's going to be really fun.

1923
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:32,020
 We just added a thing that's going to make people very happy.

1924
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,180
 It is.

1925
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,280
 Make a road trip of it.

1926
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,280
 Do what you got to do.

1927
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:40,800
 I don't know if you guys saw this in the chat of our Scoop group stuff, but we had a pair

1928
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,380
 of Scoops who are coming to Scoopfest who ran into a little financial hiccup as far

1929
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:51,780
 as return tickets went for their flights back out of Vegas.

1930
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:57,020
 Our community stepped up and already helped them out, got them some GoFundMe coin to get

1931
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,500
 them a flight back home.

1932
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,500
 Wow.

1933
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,420
 I mean, I'm telling you, we got the best listeners on the freaking planet.

1934
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:09,180
 I love every one of you guys and it just makes my heart swell every time I come to this podcast

1935
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,940
 to record and see all your lovely faces and people that message me.

1936
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,300
 I don't get mean messages.

1937
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,940
 I just get nice stuff.

1938
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:20,740
 The occasional, "Paul, you didn't get this right thing," but that's about it.

1939
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,180
 Right, right.

1940
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,180
 That's about it.

1941
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,700
 Most of the time, I get, "Paul was right," so I like that too.

1942
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:31,820
 I hardly ever get mean messages, but when I do, several people make sure to forward

1943
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:32,820
 them to me.

1944
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,620
 So I do have that going for me.

1945
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:39,700
 Yes, Winterscoop pointing out that only my heart is swollen when I come.

1946
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,060
 Yes, that's what happens.

1947
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,100
 Just my heart swells.

1948
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,100
 It's a condition.

1949
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,100
 Yeah, yeah.

1950
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,940
 I saw it in the comic.

1951
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,780
 It depicted like a circle in a circle.

1952
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,780
 Hey.

1953
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:51,780
 Yeah, that's right.

1954
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,780
 Some people out there might be looking for another podcast.

1955
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:57,340
 You can participate in our Abla scheme by selecting one person and one person only to

1956
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:58,700
 check out our podcast.

1957
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:02,660
 I say, promise them all the snappy dialogue.

1958
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,060
 That's a lot of snappy dialogue.

1959
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,060
 God damn.

1960
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,060
 Very snappy.

1961
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,060
 I got snapped on.

1962
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,740
 I snapped on for my Gilmore appreciation.

1963
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:13,700
 But the dialogue, it's so snappy.

1964
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:23,020
 Out of them, we are the Gilmore girls of dudes podcasting.

1965
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,980
 I'm sure we tackled a lot of the same issues.

1966
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,980
 Thanks, everybody.

1967
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:26,980
 Stay safe out there.

1968
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,980
 We love you and we'll see you soon.

1969
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:28,980
 We'll see you soon.

1970
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:29,980
 See you.

1971
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:54,620
 Paul is Jesse from the Gilmore girls.

1972
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,620
 Jesse.

1973
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,620
 Yeah.

1974
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,620
 Jesse is a character in the Gilmore Girls, I think.

1975
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:04,300
 Marble Tulip Scooby Tree over at Twitch is team Jesse for life.

1976
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,060
 Oh, oh, yes.

1977
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,580
 Jesse is Luke's son.

1978
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,980
 So Rory, the daughter, is torn.

1979
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:10,980
 Paul, I didn't care.

1980
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:11,980
 Oh, no.

1981
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:17,500
 But she's torn between Jesse and this rich kid.

1982
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,500
 What's his name?

1983
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,500
 Logan.

1984
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,500
 Logan Huntsberger.

1985
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,500
 Logan Huntsberger.

1986
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:28,020
 I happen to be team Logan Huntsberger.

1987
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:35,420
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Logan Huntsberger.

1988
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,100
 He calls her ace.

1989
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:42,940
 It's the cutest thing in the world and she should have stuck with him, but she was conflicted

1990
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,700
 and dumb and young.

1991
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,700
 What are you going to do?

1992
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,700
 That's how it is.

1993
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,700
 Well, I got to go.

1994
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:52,140
 You don't want to stick around for the snappy dialogue?

1995
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:57,780
 There's so much snappy dialogue though, man.

1996
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,780
 See ya.

1997
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:02,620
 I can't believe Logan Huntsberger occupies a bunch of hunk of my brain.
