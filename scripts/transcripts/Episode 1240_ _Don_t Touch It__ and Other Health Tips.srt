1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh hello there, everybody! I would like to thank all you ice cream truck drivers out there.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Those are the folks that deliver that freaking ice cream straight into your freaking ear holes.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Right now I'd like to...

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 The average internet home. It's, well, pretty average.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 It's where award-winning dramas get dinged for frequent buffering.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Some talented racers lag off the track.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 And that next promotion goes to the person not breaking up on the call.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 So don't be an average internet home. Be a Gateway Fiber home.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 With super-fast speeds, you'll catch all of that epic monologue,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 race with a permanent power-up, and present so everyone can hear you.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Unless you're on mute.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Check availability at gatewayfiber.com and make the move.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And don't forget about your first month free.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'd like to thank Richard Dunn, Sarah Boyle, Sax Guy Jimmy D, Scoop,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Scoop Brady, Scoop Dijor, Scoop Kada, Scoopy Kyae Motherfucker,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Thunder Cougar Falcon Scoop, and Travis Chiguri.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Oh, God damn it!

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Slippy Kyae Motherfucker made me say "motherfucker" instead of "motherfricker."

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Now we've been demonetized.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Right. It doesn't even matter now. It's all over.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Oh, no!

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 come help us because we've just been demonetized from this YouTube stream

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 because of Thunder Cougar Falcon Scoop and Slippy Kyae Motherfucker.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Come on over, be an ice cream truck driver, preachingfun.com, who knows?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 The life you save may be your own.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Here's the show.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Hey, Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Yeah, I'd love to.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Great. Let's go.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I don't know how I made it the first 45 years of my life without jabbing sunblock directly into my eyeball.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But for some reason I have a problem where I keep putting sunblock in my eye.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And then I'm like, fuck, for like hours.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 For hours? It's time for Matt Donnelly's Ice Cream Social.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Sitting in Las Vegas, that's Matt Donnelly.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, that's Paul Mattingly.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Also in Las Vegas, it's me, Jacob the Audio Guy.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're preaching fun.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Yeah. What's up, fools?

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Are we on Twitch? People are saying we're not doing Twitch, blah, blah, blah.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Oh, are we not on Twitch? I'll try and put us on Twitch again.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Are we not on Twitch?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I think we're on Twitch now. Maybe we weren't a minute ago.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Okay, well...

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Ah, yes, that is true. We are now on Twitch. Hello, Twitch!

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And a ranch slug, if you're asking, it is from a man finishing in my eye at a truck stop.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Oh my god, a Finnish man?

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 A Finnish man finishing.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Yeah. I was like, do any of you speak Finnish?

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You? Great. Get in the shower.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So, 50 sunblock. So sunblock, you know, whether it's 20, 30, 50, whatever the SPF.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 50 is your go-to SPF?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Alright.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because I'm a porcelain-skinned beauty.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And for those of us not familiar, what does SPF stand for?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Social Proof Functions.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 That's right. Social Proof Functions. No one wins when they wear sunscreen.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And so, but the SPF, the higher the number, it just is the more this stuff takes longer to break down in your skin.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That's the only thing. It's like, whatever's mixed with the sunblock, it's mixed with the substance that slowly goes into your skin, slowly but surely.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 So when I try to protect this beautiful moneymaker right here, the face for audio that you're listening to right now...

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 You can't see it if you're just listening to the show. Matt just pointed at his ass.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 He pointed at his beautiful white ass.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Now, I've learned my lesson.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 His alabaster white.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I ruined our interview with Colin Cloud by being a weird mess the entire time with my eyeball the entire time.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Right? That's the most embarrassing interview we've had.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Somehow Colin and I are still... No, no, no. There were more embarrassing interviews.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We're still nice to each other, but we would have been closer had it been a normal person on that podcast. We would be friends.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Fair, fair.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But, so...

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 He did actually, Colin and I had lunch yesterday and he said, "What the fuck is up with Matt's eyes?"

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 You're like, "Oh no, he's on a real streak. Nothing. Nothing. He's been on a roll."

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Actually, that's not true. We don't talk about you because it puts a weird damper on our relationship.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And so I put it in my eye and then once it starts singing I go, "Oh shit, I messed up again."

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And I know it's going to be like this way for the afternoon because it takes that long for 50 SPF to absorb.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 That's the whole idea.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 This is how I live now.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I can't make it go away.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But I did that because I went over to my kid's fun run.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So we started our recording an hour later today so I could be there for my child.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Stop your angry emails.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 You and your paternal responsibilities.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 My child comes first.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 That's what my wife keeps telling me.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You don't have a child.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 No, but she says she comes first.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Uh oh.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Oh, I thought she was telling you that Matt's children came first.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 As a rule, if you do first then she's mad?

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 No, no, in marital affair times, in snuggle times, wife comes first.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And I agree.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So I go over there.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Now the fun run, there's a few scoops who are very generous to donate to my channel's campaign.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 If they haven't already, they'll get a cute little thank you video for it.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 If you haven't gotten your thank you video and you think you're owed one, email me at matt@hayscoops.com.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Don't do that if you're in the chat.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 You've got to give me the weekend.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But this comes out on Monday.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So if you haven't gotten it by Monday, I should have gotten you a goddamn video.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 We do indeed have a wonderful, generous community.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And it's all to go to this fun run, right?

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And so this fun run raises funds for the schools while this company makes money putting it on, right?

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So I just found out today that the school doesn't get all the money.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I always thought the funding was put on by the school.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It's put on a company that runs it.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Oh, boy.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 What is there to run?

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So they show up.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 They have prizes for individuals who raise a certain amount of money, right?

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And that's when my kid's trying to get this annoying beach ball to annoy his mom.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's his campaign.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And they also come with all these accoutrements.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 When the kids do this actual run on the school, there's like a water squirting tunnel.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 There's like different obstacles.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 There's like a big foam machine.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I think they give out all these water pistol cannons to the teachers for the kids.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It's this big outdoor event, right?

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Okay.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I thought all this stuff belonged to the school and I was wrong.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Now, I get it's not -- I get like someone probably did run it for a school one year.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And like someone said, we should do this for all the schools.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Yeah.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And then it becomes a business and the business has costs and blah, blah, blah.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Yeah, sure.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So they don't get all the dough.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 But so if they got to -- they raised $50,000 for the school, which is probably $25,000

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 or something after the company gets cut.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 After they get their feet wet.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 They take half.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Good Lord.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 They probably do.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 They probably do.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And I was like, is it capped?

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Because if we go over a certain amount, all that money should go to the school.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Once you make enough to go through the fun run, you should be calling it.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But I'm not on the PTA and I'm not about to join the PTA for this issue.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Matt Donnelly, PTA president.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So the goal was to get the $50,000 for the school, you know, five or six grades altogether,

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 raising 50 grand.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 They -- the science teacher is going to shave his head for the whole school.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Oh, boy.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 The kids would go crazy for the shaving of heads.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Right.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Right.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 That translates.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 That has been a time honored tradition.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 That's always been a big thing with wrestling back in the day.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 They don't do it anymore.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I haven't seen them do it in like, I don't know, a long time.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But that used to be a big thing.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I just saw a fun interview, a fun wrestling interview this week with -- who was the -- I know his name.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 The Olympic guy who was with WWF for a long time.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Kurt Angle.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Kurt Angle.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 He was talking about a match that he had had with another wrestler who I didn't recognize, I don't think.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 But apparently, this other wrestler had really long, flowing hair.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And Kurt Angle said, "Vince McMahon came to me and said, 'Hey, you're losing your hair.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Let's do a match where you get your head shaved at the end of it.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 But don't tell the other guy, because I'm going to tell him that he has to shave his head.'"

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Oh.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 That's pretty slick, actually.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And they just played a joke on this other guy until the day of.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And they were like, "No, no, no. You're going to win. You're going to shave his head."

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Hilarious.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Pretty slick.

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Well, Vince McMahon is such a cut up.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 What a card.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Really makes you appreciate Vince McMahon's sense of humor.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I think maybe I was wrong about him.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Exactly.

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Good dude.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He's just a scamp.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Good dude.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Good dude.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Misunderstood.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Union busting and sexual predator aside, good dude.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Yeah, yeah.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I wonder if he has any spouses that could run things on a federal level.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 I bet he does.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Let's try.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 You know, a woman who's an entertainer and a magician in town.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Stacy Stardust, our friend Stacy Stardust.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Oh yeah.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 We like Stacy.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 She's one of the people that puts a lot of motivational stuff up on her Instagram feed all the time.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Gotcha.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And so I had this really heartfelt rallying speech by Dana White.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And I was like, Dana White straight up hit a woman at a party like in front of everyone.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Yeah, he slapped his wife at the slap preview.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He was at the event to preview the slap competition stuff, and he just slapped his wife.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And I was like, if you want to privately be inspired by Dana White, you go right ahead.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 As any entertainer, I don't want to put anything up with Dana White.

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 But as a woman entertainer, you want to be like, see this woman slapper?

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 You can learn from him.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 This woman slapper.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Don't forget our favorite NFL player, Ray Rice.

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Come on, Ray.

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Oh my god.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 So they hit the $50,000 goal to shave the guy's head.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 They did it.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 They had a couple more days.

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And so what they want to do is they want to add stretch goals.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Right?

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Ah, OK, good.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Bubes?

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Is he going street legal?

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 No, no, no.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 They upgrade, instead of shaving, they upgrade to Nair water cannons.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 What?

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Oh, god.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 They just braid every hair off of him.

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Oh, Jesus.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Oh, Jesus.

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Nair pressure washing.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 He's just going to look like one of those Mr. Bigglesworth true cats.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 He's going to be fucked.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Good god.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 No, no, no.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 No, we get an email from the principal saying that if we reach $55,000.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 OK.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 The principal and vice principal, we will dress up like babies for a day.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Did you tell them that we tried that and it didn't work?

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I was like, can I show you this Whistling Weirdos video from the Gong show?

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 No, I was literally like, dress up like babies?

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Like what?

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Why are you trying to be all sexy?

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Like, no, don't make me dress up like a baby.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Don't raise so much money, I got to dress like a baby.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 No.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Where would I ever find a pacifier in this bottle I could drink out of?

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 What?

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 No.

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 How will I find the time to go out to my car and get my baby out and fit?

235
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It's not Saturday.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 But I definitely don't always have it in my car with me.

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And if we get to $60,000, I'll fill my diaper.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Don't make me do it.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Don't make me shit publicly.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Don't make me publicly shit in a diaper.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I'll be so embarrassed.

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 What will I do?

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I'll never be able to show my sexy face again.

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I probably won't even be able to masturbate properly.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 No, I will.

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I'll find a way.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 If it's $65, you can discipline me for a dirty diaper by putting this dog leash on me.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Oh my God, right?

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 It just keeps getting worse.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 For $70, you can spit on me.

251
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 $70 is the spit level.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 All the students at the school can just spit on me for $70,000.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Oh, God.

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You made it to spit level, guys.

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Yep.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Scoop up Monte Cristo.

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Oh, we didn't make our goal, but oops, I'm dressed like a baby anyway.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Sorry.

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Aren't I silly?

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I'm such a silly goose.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I thought it was baby day.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Oh, boy.

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I don't want these two ladies dressed like a baby.

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Oh, they're ladies.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Yeah.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I've changed my mind.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You're in.

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Paul is now donating to my kids fundraiser.

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Yeah, exactly.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Where's that URL?

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Hold on.

272
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Paul is now getting him straight to $70,000.

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Hold on.

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Hold on.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Hold on.

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Two lady principals?

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Hold on.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Hold on.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Two ladies.

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And then there was an established goal for $60,000.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And the same guy who shaved his head was going to dye his eyebrows blue.

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And I was like, can we have a meeting about stretch goals?

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Can we just-- can we have it up?

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Just five minutes.

285
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Five minutes, everybody.

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Like, I get it.

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 You thought 50 grand was shooting for the moon.

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 You were not prepared.

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 You were not prepared to go over that goal.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Let's just circle wagons for a sec, and let's just figure some stuff out.

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Don't be a baby lady.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 We're doing some really weird kinky shit for these stretch goals.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Don't be a lady baby.

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 We've gone straight to babies.

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And I don't think all the children in the movie are like, oh my god, blue eyebrows.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 That would be the best.

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I will say that eyebrow shaving is, I think for an adult, a bigger deal than head shaving.

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 It's dangerous because sometimes they don't grow back.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Exactly.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 That's not a good idea.

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Yeah.

302
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It's a gamble.

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And even dying, if you use the wrong kind of dye, you know, it could be bad.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It'll kill you.

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 You could be stuck putting shit on your eye like I am right now.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 That could happen to you.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Matt, are you not able to use spray?

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I don't want to spray my eye.

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 That's where this all started.

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But you do it while you have your eyes closed.

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You just slightly.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That's what I do.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I use the aerosol.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I know how sunblock works, guy.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Apparently you don't.

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I'm sorry to say, Matt.

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 No, you do not.

318
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 There's evidence to the contrary.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 There's lots of evidence to the contrary.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 You do not know how fucking sunblock works.

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 You push down and the liquid just comes out like spray?

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It's aerosolized.

324
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's great.

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 No, I do that every time before I mow the lawn.

326
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I hose myself in the face and arms and legs.

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Every time before Paul mows the lawn, I hose him in the face.

328
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 That's how it works.

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And I think about two principals dressed like babies while I do it.

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 That'll make me spray every time.

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I can't stop spraying.

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 SPLs.

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I pre-spray babies.

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So much pre-spray.

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I do.

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I find the spray on my--

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 There it is.

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Scoop a body crystal as your solution.

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Yes.

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 You've got to get this.

341
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I'm not against it.

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I'm not with the weird little like suntan booth goggles.

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I'm not against it.

344
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You could just use-- I bet you have goggles.

345
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Don't you have goggles from your kids?

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Just some swim goggles.

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Yeah, don't you have to destroy your little swim goggles?

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I'm just going to put on a scuba mask and I'll just slather around the scuba mask.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 I know the scuba mask won't work.

350
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's too much area covered.

351
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Anyway.

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I know.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That's why I'm making that joke.

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I know the difference between goggles and a scuba mask.

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 You should put a bag over your head before you apply your sunscreen.

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 It won't get in your eyes.

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Another person told me to put a bag over my head.

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Boy, I got this all the time at Abu Grabe and now here?

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Geez.

360
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I've done the spray and I find that the spray when I'm out in the sun for a long time is

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 not very effective.

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Is the spray not very effective or do you touch it?

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Well, I spray the other way and I walk into it like perfume.

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Paul is not confident in Matt's ability to put on sunscreen at all.

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'm not.

366
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Paul's confidence in Matt's ability to do this on his own is at an all time low.

367
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I've been mowing my lawn in the blazing sun.

368
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Does it not work or do you touch it?

369
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I use a fucking whisper of Aldi brand spray and I'm fine for hours.

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And where do you live?

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Pennsylvania.

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Well.

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Okay.

374
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 All right.

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Hey, hey, hey.

376
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But I did that shit.

377
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I did that shit on the strip promoting as the gazillionaire and I had to spray up there

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 every day too.

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You know who else just had a personal revelation about the sun?

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Yeah.

381
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 That's the following sponsor.

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Today's show, Matt Madigan's Ice Cream Social.

383
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Trust him.

384
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And Who That Baby podcast.

385
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Who That Baby, drop it in the diaper.

386
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Brought to you by, from Coke, Inc.

387
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 It's Baroque Coke, soaked, bespoke, smoked oak cloaks.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 That's from the Gorilla Dentist from that Björk video in 2025.

389
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I'm sorry.

390
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I looked in the chat and watching the Mace clip of two people spraying each other in the

391
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 bathroom.

392
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Exactly how it would be.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Yes, I'm sorry.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That's the Baroque Coke, soaked, bespoke, smoked oak cloaks.

395
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's a cloak product.

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It's a cloak product?

397
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Cloak.

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I know it's a cloak, but it's, but it's coke soaked.

399
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 That's right.

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Okay.

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 From the Baroque period.

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 All right.

403
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So here's what I did.

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I went to a place that specializes in Baroque art and I stole a cloak from a display of

405
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 art that is Baroque.

406
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And then I soaked it in Coke.

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And while it was still wet, I had a tailor customize it to me so that it was bespoke.

408
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And then I made sure to smoke it with some essence of oak wood.

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So it was oak smoked.

410
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 It was an oak smoked Baroque cloak that was bespoke and soaked with Coke.

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I don't think you said soaked.

412
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 That's all of them.

413
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 That's all of them.

414
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Was that it?

415
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 We checked every box.

416
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 I got it.

417
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It's a full commercial.

418
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I got it.

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 We nailed it.

420
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's good to check out.

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 We nailed it.

422
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I'm in the bank.

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Now we got to get back to this sunscreen shit.

424
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Do your children burn easily?

425
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Have you taught them how to do it right?

426
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 You remember, as long as the podcast will remember, that I had a really great father-son chat.

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And then an hour later, we went to put sunblock on and they closed their eyes.

428
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And I did a spray.

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I did one and I wasn't quick enough to do the second so that he opened his eyes and

430
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I sprayed him right in the eye.

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 So this is genetic here.

432
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 This is a tradition now.

433
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 We're just not meant to be.

434
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 We should just go back to cloudy Ireland where our genetics belong.

435
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I see.

436
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Right.

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And hide and drink Guinness and tell stories and fight fires.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 This is what we should do.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But yeah, finally back to the sunscreen talk.

440
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Yeah.

441
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Anyways.

442
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Yeah.

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So I hear you, Paul.

444
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I usually can spray.

445
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 No problem.

446
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But I'm in the sun.

447
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I know I'm going to be in the sun for a long time.

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You go with the cream.

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 50 proof SPF so that I don't burn my nose.

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Have you thought about going with like those zinc products that are color?

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I should have.

452
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I have it.

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 I know that the mineral ones where I look like a ghost, but it works.

454
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Well, not even that.

455
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Like there's the ones like, remember all the ones that like turn you blue until it, until it sinks in.

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 The, the, the life guards used to have the blue on their nose.

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 There's, there's mineral based sunscreens that are maybe way thicker than what you're talking about, but you still have.

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I know what you mean.

459
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Yeah.

460
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Yeah.

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And they do.

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 They really do do the job.

463
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 They do do.

464
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 They do do the job.

465
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 They do specifically designed for darker skin.

466
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 If I'm not mistaken.

467
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Well, I look legit, there's a legit Irish jeans in terms of that, like skin cancers in my family.

468
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 That's why I don't like to rely on the spray.

469
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Oh, you should just stay out of the sun, man.

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I try.

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 What are you doing in Las Vegas?

472
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Matt, Matt, you should get some sunscreen.

473
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I'm getting different, just a different brand sunscreen.

474
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 By the way, the thing that frozen custard put in the chat there that like, kind of like that, like it's basically a deodorant stick, a tiny mini deodorant stick of, of.

475
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Yeah.

476
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Rub on some black.

477
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Those do work.

478
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They're effective.

479
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 But again, in Las Vegas, if you leave it outdoors anywhere, that's melty, melty.

480
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It just, it's like, like a candy bar.

481
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It just melts.

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 It's just gone.

483
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Yeah.

484
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Yeah.

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Even the car or whatever it's, it's all.

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 You need a cooler for your sunscreen.

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 That's it.

488
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Like a white mask on my face, a cooler of sunscreen.

489
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 You'll be fine.

490
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You'll be fine.

491
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 You have all those coolers with the wheels on it.

492
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 You can just pull it behind you.

493
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 You should just get, just get some, just straight up Bukkake yourself and don't even rub it in.

494
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 There you go.

495
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 That's exact.

496
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Tin Scoop has exactly the look I'm talking about.

497
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Oh, those principles go full baby.

498
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I'm Bukkake myself.

499
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 That's for sure.

500
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 For $75,000.

501
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Yeah.

502
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 We will let you powder our asses.

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I'm actually wiping away my constant tears with an old t-shirt just because Keata Clumsy,

504
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 it's her favorite specific about men, is having old t-shirts around.

505
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 So.

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Oh yeah.

507
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I figured I'd collect tears.

508
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 There.

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 That is true.

510
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I cleaned my shop yesterday and I was looking for rags and I used two old t-shirts.

511
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 There you go.

512
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 That were on a shelf in my shop.

513
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 That's why you keep them.

514
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 That's it.

515
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's it.

516
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I was walking around yesterday.

517
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I was walking around on the strip yesterday and a fella approached me.

518
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I was on my kind of regular circuit.

519
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 My nice, Matt just has a sock that he's now dabbing his eye with.

520
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Yeah, that request that I switched to a sock.

521
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Oh good.

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Oh, I sent you a text about your eye.

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 We need a picture of your eye.

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Oh God.

525
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 For what?

526
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 We need a selfie.

527
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Yeah, probably.

528
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Oh, I hate you.

529
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Okay.

530
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Anything for the pod.

531
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 That's right.

532
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So I'm walking around yesterday and I am in front of the Harris Casino.

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 At the Harris Casino, they have a crosswalk there that crosses across the strip there.

534
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 So I'm waiting there.

535
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I'm waiting for the crosswalk to change to cross over like 10 lanes of traffic that is

536
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 the Las Vegas Strip.

537
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And I am underneath a little overhang in the Harris Casino as is my habit when I stand

538
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 there, because it has one of those air curtains, one of those outdoor air curtains.

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 So it keeps the hot air outside and keeps the cold air inside.

540
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So I just stand under that and it keeps me nice and cool.

541
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 So as I'm standing there, a young man approaches me.

542
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I would say in his mid-20s, and this has happened on occasion before, and I believe I told some

543
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 stories from Portugal where I was offered some various types of drugs in Portugal.

544
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,600
 So this guy comes up to me and he says, "The weirdest thing to open," but then I very much

545
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,600
 appreciated him later, because his opening was, "Hey, when you want to graduate to ski

546
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
 boots, let me know."

547
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Oh, that's a good opener there.

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And I knew what he meant already.

549
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 I knew what he was offering me already.

550
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 He's offering me cocaine.

551
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 He was going to fill a ski boot with bourbon and you're going to drink straight from the

552
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 boot.

553
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Oh, God.

554
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But I didn't know what he meant by graduate to ski boots.

555
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 He meant you were high already at other things.

556
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 That's what graduate is.

557
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 That too.

558
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 He was like, "When you're ready to get higher than you are."

559
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That's probably what he meant, actually, now that you say it.

560
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 He was mistaken, but that's probably what he meant.

561
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 So I'm standing there and I'm opening my mouth to say basically, "No, thank you."

562
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And he thinks that I don't understand him.

563
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 So he goes, "Yeah, we're going to go skiing.

564
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 We're going to go skiing."

565
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And I still can't get my mouth open.

566
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 He goes, "In the snow.

567
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 We're going to go skiing in the snow."

568
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And then he leans in and I'm just smiling at this point.

569
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I'm thrilled at this point.

570
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 He leans in close to me and goes, "Cocaine."

571
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And everyone around him was like, "Cocaine."

572
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Yes.

573
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I was like, "I need you to do less cocaine.

574
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I am worried about you.

575
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I need you to do this less.

576
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 All of your friends and family are very concerned."

577
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 He's like, "I actually could have just been more direct.

578
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 No one cares, but I just love slang.

579
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I just love to speak the street."

580
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 He had a whole thing that he just ratted.

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 He was like, "You want to graduate with some ski boots?

582
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 We're going to go skiing.

583
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I mean in the snow.

584
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Cocaine."

585
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You need to have more faith in your metaphors, sir.

586
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Yeah.

587
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Clearly.

588
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I got it.

589
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I had you the first time, man.

590
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I was already not interested in buying cocaine from you after the first thing you said.

591
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 But I laughed, and I gave him a smile.

592
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I said, "I'm all set right now."

593
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I think I said something like, "I'm all set for ski boots right now," or something like that.

594
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And he smiled.

595
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 "O-caine-kay."

596
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 "O-caine-kay."

597
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 He just goes into Big Latin.

598
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 "O-caine-kay."

599
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 "Ud-way.

600
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 U-way.

601
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I-lay.

602
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 U-day.

603
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I-bay.

604
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 U-caine-ay."

605
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I'm on Mount Fuji with a Yeti, bro.

606
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I'm good.

607
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I have a nasal salve in powdered form.

608
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 What?

609
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Mood enhancer.

610
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I was like, "I'm good, man.

611
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I'm good."

612
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Mood enhancer.

613
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 And he smiled.

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 He said, "Well, if you change your mind, I hang out right over here."

615
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And I said, "I got you, man."

616
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 We gave each other the nice fist bump, and we parted friends.

617
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 But I have a cocaine dealer friend now.

618
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 How many guys do change their minds?

619
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 How many guys walk five steps and go, "Actually, yeah, I'll take the cocaine."

620
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Probably not zero.

622
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Not one.

623
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Yeah, it's not zero.

624
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Hey, you want to erode your septum?

625
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Yeah.

626
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Huh?

627
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Cocaine.

628
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Ooh.

629
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Street drugs.

630
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Guys, I didn't mean to swipe the A-block with my PTA talk there.

631
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Well, you did.

632
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Thanks a lot.

633
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 We have to get down to talking about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey's engagement, right?

634
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Finally.

635
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 We're late enough in the news cycle that I think the backlash against it is hilarious.

636
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 I can't believe there's backlash.

637
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Who cares?

638
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Have you seen the Taylor Swift haters out there, mostly hardcore right-wing people,

639
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,760
 MAGA people, that have said Taylor Swift's career was going down the toilet so she attached

640
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
 herself to a famous man?

641
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Oh, boy.

642
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Oh, boy.

643
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Yeah.

644
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 That's insanity.

645
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 That's insanity.

646
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 She made more money than anyone.

647
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 No, no, no, no.

648
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 That's just idiocy.

649
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 That's meant to be trolling.

650
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 They're not actually trolling.

651
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I think so.

652
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Yes, I think so.

653
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I'm sick of living in this world where bizarro opinions matter.

654
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Yes.

655
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,860
 Everybody knows that Taylor Swift has billions more dollars than Travis Kelsey in her bank

656
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
 account.

657
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
 Right.

658
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:49,200
 But I'm all for it taking up space in the news non-politically because all we're doing

659
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,160
 is assaulted by these terrible things.

660
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,680
 I love having non-political big news stories.

661
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,600
 I was like, "I don't even care that much, but you know what?

662
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,280
 I'm going to root for it and I'm going to be here for it because it just means I'm not

663
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,820
 reading a story about Trump.

664
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
 So let's go.

665
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
 Let's dive in."

666
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
 Yeah, it's great.

667
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,000
 I want nothing but good things for them.

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Good for them.

669
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,100
 Hooray, billionaire people.

670
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,200
 Go have a good life.

671
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,680
 Paul has no beef with this at all.

672
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,720
 I don't have any beef with it, honestly.

673
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 It's fine.

674
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
 It's cute.

675
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,520
 My wife is very invested.

676
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,280
 I mean, I have bought several Taylor Swift songs.

677
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,720
 I like Taylor Swift's work.

678
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,320
 I'm not a Taylor hater by any means.

679
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,760
 I think she's really very talented, very good.

680
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:45,040
 But there's rumors she will play the halftime show and/or possibly the Sphere.

681
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,280
 Oh yeah, yeah.

682
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,040
 That makes sense.

683
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,120
 The halftime show I think makes more sense to me.

684
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
 Here's why the halftime show makes sense to me.

685
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,240
 The Sphere doesn't make as much sense to me because it ties her here and she can't make

686
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,760
 as much money in the Sphere as she can in stadiums.

687
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,040
 Unless she charges crazy money per Sphere seat.

688
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:11,420
 But they already charge crazy money per seat in the stadiums as the only person in the

689
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:18,720
 three of us who has bought Taylor Swift concert tickets and has bought Sphere concert tickets,

690
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,000
 the Taylor Swift concert tickets were much more expensive.

691
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,600
 Actually, you have invested a percentage into their wedding planning.

692
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
 Yeah.

693
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
 Yeah, yeah.

694
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
 I think I paid for the veil or something.

695
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,200
 You may have paid for one or two of those flowers during the photo shoot for the proposal.

696
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:47,480
 One petal of the flower, one little tiny hoop of the veil, one tiny little tiny hole.

697
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,280
 You paid for a tiny hole, Jacob.

698
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,600
 I paid for a tiny hole.

699
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,400
 But the Super Bowl thing makes sense because we were talking about on chat yesterday.

700
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
 The album is coming out.

701
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,320
 The Showgirl album is going to come out in October, which means that by the time the

702
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,320
 Super Bowl rolls around, she could be into full swing promo mode for whatever new tour

703
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,240
 she's going to make another $3 billion off of.

704
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
 Yeah.

705
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
 Yeah.

706
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,120
 So I mean, the Super Bowl thing makes sense just from an advertising standpoint.

707
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
 Yeah.

708
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
 But the Sphere-

709
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
 The Sphere would be amazing.

710
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,080
 For a rap standpoint, because she would have to play like 50 concerts or something for

711
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
 multiple years.

712
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,800
 I mean, she could just do a year-long Sphere residency.

713
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,960
 Yeah, she could just park it in Vegas and just make it-

714
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,600
 She's one of the only ones that could actually do that.

715
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,120
 She could just do five days a week at the Sphere if she wanted to.

716
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
 She really could.

717
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
 Yeah.

718
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
 Yeah.

719
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
 Yeah.

720
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
 And just sell it out and just do it that way.

721
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,080
 She could just have a full-time job.

722
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,640
 And then I could apply to be her sunblock applier, and I could try to spray and have her walk

723
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,040
 through the spray and yell, "Don't touch it!"

724
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
 "Don't touch it!"

725
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,320
 Don't touch it as she goes through it.

726
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,080
 And she'll be like, "It doesn't work!" and you'll be like, "Did you touch it?

727
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,000
 Is it the product or did you touch it?"

728
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,080
 You know you touch it.

729
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
 You touched it.

730
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
 You touched it.

731
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,040
 You know who else touched it?

732
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 The following sponsor.

733
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,160
 Today's show, Matt and Manly's Ice Cream Social is brought to you by Uncle Johnny's Super

734
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,240
 Mega Awesome Golden Puke Bucket Emporium.

735
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
 It's from Brian the Boulder Scoop in 2022.

736
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,920
 This is Uncle Johnny's Super Mega Awesome Golden Puke Bucket Emporium.

737
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,800
 Hey, you butthole-faced dummy.

738
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,440
 I'm Uncle Johnny.

739
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,200
 Uncle Johnny is here with the puke bucket.

740
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
 Hey!

741
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,000
 You want a look in it?

742
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,400
 Better be a quarter, a shiny quarter to Uncle Johnny before you get to look inside Uncle

743
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,760
 Johnny's puke bucket, you butthole-faced turd.

744
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 Come over here.

745
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
 Come over here.

746
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,200
 Let me see your face.

747
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,400
 Come over here next to Uncle Johnny.

748
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,920
 Uncle Johnny wants to touch it.

749
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
 Your face.

750
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
 Just your face.

751
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
 No, thank you.

752
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,080
 Put it in the bucket.

753
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,760
 Put the quarter in the bucket and puke on it.

754
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,240
 Uncle Johnny's got a million dollars.

755
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,880
 Uncle Johnny's got a million dollars.

756
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,520
 Uncle Johnny's got a million dollars.

757
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,720
 And our hate scoop's a check out.

758
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
 No!

759
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,320
 Jacob, why are you cutting off that goal?

760
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
 I don't know.

761
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
 That bit was just getting warmed up.

762
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,800
 I must have had a leave of license.

763
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,640
 That bit was just getting warmed up now.

764
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
 Clearly.

765
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,520
 Oh, they had just been cleared for takeoff.

766
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,080
 Uncle Johnny was going to go to some real dark places.

767
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:55,600
 There was a lot of gold still to be mined in Uncle Johnny.

768
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,920
 The voice reminded me a little too much of my real Uncle Johnny.

769
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
 Triggered.

770
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,720
 Yeah, yeah, triggered.

771
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
 Triggered.

772
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,920
 My Uncle Johnny, who's not really my uncle, I think he's like a second cousin or something.

773
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
 Yeah.

774
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,200
 But yeah, that was a little too close to Uncle John right there.

775
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,800
 It's very tricky to balance that Uncle Johnny voice and not slip into full Cosby, which

776
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,440
 I was dancing on the line.

777
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,640
 But I managed to do it.

778
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
 I was pretty proud of myself.

779
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:32,680
 I just put an inspirational quote from Cosby up on my Instagram.

780
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,160
 Oh, good.

781
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,720
 Here, drink this.

782
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
 I separate art from the artist.

783
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
 Yeah.

784
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
 Good.

785
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,960
 I separate art from the Garfunkel.

786
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:52,800
 Oh, so you guys can figure out whether you want Uncle Johnny there to be in the Hollywood

787
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,520
 Squares come Scoop Fest and figure out which characters you want for that.

788
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
 Uncle Johnny.

789
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
 Oh, Uncle Johnny.

790
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,640
 You get Uncle Johnny three lines, the three line character Uncle Johnny, who just basically

791
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,240
 says Uncle Johnny has a million dollars.

792
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,960
 But that, you know what?

793
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,000
 And the promise is he's going to get a lot worse.

794
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,320
 He's got three lines and a promise.

795
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,960
 The promise of getting terrible.

796
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,400
 Just a reminder, I'm going to be in San Antonio next week, so by the time you hear this, I'm

797
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,200
 here Monday through Saturday, the first through the seventh with shows every night at the Magic

798
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
 Saloon in downtown San Antonio.

799
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,240
 Come check it out.

800
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
 Nice.

801
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
 You guys want to do a little Scoop Mail?

802
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
 More than anything.

803
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,000
 Let's do a little Scoop Mail.

804
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,280
 Message for you, son.

805
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,280
 Well, y'all want to hear from the Satanic Scoop?

806
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,000
 My dearest churn migrants, I have long thought about a frustration I've heard voiced by Matt

807
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,880
 and Jacob and also by other commentators that I probably would put in the box labeled normal.

808
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,920
 How much you can consider a magician slash improv comic normal is left as an exercise

809
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,360
 for the observer that you never see in sports, movies or TV shows anymore as a fictional

810
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
 exercise.

811
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,080
 You get little drips here and there like Ted Lasso or that Will Ferrell show or the upcoming

812
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,600
 movie Hymn from Jordan Peele.

813
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,560
 But it is an undeniable fact, even to sports ball denier like myself, that the institution

814
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,960
 of the sports show has disappeared from the popular consciousness, at least in America.

815
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,920
 You see, gentlemen, there is one place where the sports drama is still strong and it's

816
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,920
 motherfucking anime.

817
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,520
 What?

818
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,800
 Every year brings in a new crop of stories of big dreams of athletic glory.

819
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,960
 Like some of them like Yuri on Ice are delightfully gay.

820
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,240
 There's even an American hand egg anime.

821
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
 It's called Ice Shield 21.

822
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,360
 And while tragically heterosexual, that is still pretty darn good.

823
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,120
 There are racing soccer, figure skating, track and field and basketball animes, tennis and

824
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,280
 basketball are there.

825
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,040
 There are boxing and wrestling shows of every stripe.

826
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,680
 It's all there, my friends.

827
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,080
 There's even a show about girls trying to knock each other into a pool with their asses.

828
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,080
 And it's treated as serious as heart surgery.

829
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:26,080
 In this time when conventional sports ball has failed you, has failed all of us, might

830
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:33,240
 I suggest taking in the zany antics of cartoon pretty boys embroiled in ridiculous melodrama,

831
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,440
 respectfully fucking you in the face while giving you a 15 minute monologue about my

832
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
 tragic backstory.

833
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,040
 That's the Satanic Scoop.

834
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 All right.

835
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
 That's a fine pitch.

836
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
 Thank you, Satanic Scoop.

837
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,760
 Those are good suggestions.

838
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:53,280
 I remember back in my day when I was an old anime head getting my 18 hundreds on VHS and

839
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
 whatnot.

840
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,440
 Yeah.

841
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,320
 There was a basketball one.

842
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
 This is manga mostly.

843
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,760
 I think there maybe was an anime for it.

844
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,720
 There was a basketball one.

845
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,280
 I remember the other manga that I read.

846
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,280
 There was a big tennis one.

847
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,960
 I read a few of those just to see.

848
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,440
 And then I got into the, there was a manga all about the game of go, which we would call

849
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,240
 a fellow here in the States.

850
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
 Oh yeah.

851
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
 Yeah.

852
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
 Yeah.

853
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,560
 A manga all about go players and the competition.

854
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,720
 It was interesting.

855
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:39,000
 So they have never shied from going deep into obscure subjects to mine from.

856
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,880
 And I applaud them for it.

857
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,920
 Well, all right.

858
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
 Let's go.

859
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,720
 Let's applaud them too.

860
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
 How brave.

861
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
 Well done.

862
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
 Thank you.

863
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
 Well done.

864
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
 Thank you, anime.

865
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
 Heroes that we don't deserve.

866
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,920
 Oh, we got an email here from Scott.

867
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
 Hello.

868
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
 My name is Scott.

869
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
 I think my Scoop name is Scoop Me.

870
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,120
 No, Scoop You.

871
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,800
 Listener since 2018 yet have never wrote in, which at this point feels weird.

872
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
 Okay.

873
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 Well, I'm glad you wrote in Scott.

874
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,880
 I have a story from my dad from a couple of years ago, which I've remembered multiple

875
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,120
 times since and I've chuckled about each time.

876
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,520
 So I figured I'd pass this on.

877
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
 Please.

878
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,600
 He used to get a roll and a cup of coffee from this bakery multiple times a week.

879
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:28,800
 He walks in one particular morning to the lights half off and someone moaning help quietly

880
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,080
 from the back.

881
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,280
 Oh God.

882
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,200
 My dad being born and raised in Queens in the seventies assumes he's walked into an

883
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,400
 armed robbery yet feels too bad to not check out what's happening.

884
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,640
 Lo and behold, the older woman opening the bakery that morning fell into the steep basement

885
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,520
 while trying to put the kitchen lights on.

886
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,920
 The best part is after my dad helps her out in the basement and into the front of the

887
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,680
 shop, she immediately says to him, so what do you want?

888
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,960
 Very sharply.

889
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
 Amazing.

890
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,160
 So he like helps her up and she's like, all right, now what do you want?

891
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
 Yeah.

892
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
 My dad confused and flustered by the situation said, huh?

893
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,780
 To which she replied, why did you come in?

894
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,880
 Resulting in my dad placing his normal order and paying full price as if nothing had just

895
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
 occurred.

896
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
 Hilarious.

897
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,200
 She gave no fucks.

898
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,200
 I would provide follow up, but my dad has decided to go to Duncan ever since.

899
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
 I bet.

900
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
 I would too.

901
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,440
 It's not the best story, but you fellas have worked for the worst.

902
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,840
 Thanks for the awesome comedy.

903
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
 That's Scott.

904
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
 Hilarious.

905
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:43,720
 If I help a store connoisseur, a store owner up after having, after she has fallen into

906
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,840
 the basement, I expect at least the discount.

907
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,640
 I mean, just to thank you so much.

908
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
 Yeah.

909
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
 Yeah.

910
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,560
 Maybe, maybe a donut, maybe a free donut or a, yeah.

911
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
 Just say thank you.

912
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,280
 Not even just, what do you come in for?

913
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,120
 Thanks for helping me out of the basement.

914
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,760
 Here's a donut.

915
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,920
 I would have, and maybe this is strong, thrown her back in the basement.

916
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,160
 I think you could have done one better and put sunscreen on her.

917
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,680
 Charge me full price from down there.

918
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,360
 Charge me full price from down there.

919
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,840
 Just help her apply some sunscreen, Matt.

920
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
 That'd be far more favorite.

921
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
 Yeah.

922
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,560
 I'll just sort of mace her face and then let her stumble down the basement on her own.

923
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
 That's really funny.

924
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,920
 That's really funny.

925
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,960
 But there you go.

926
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
 And there you go.

927
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
 How funny.

928
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
 Indeed.

929
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
 Right?

930
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,160
 And also lost a customer for life.

931
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,680
 Lost a ritualistic customer.

932
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
 Well, at least weirded one out.

933
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,120
 I mean, he went to Duncan.

934
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
 Yeah.

935
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
 Like that's it.

936
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,640
 That's not something, I bet that woman went home that evening and was like, man, I fell

937
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,840
 down the steps.

938
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,520
 This patron came in and helped me up.

939
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,000
 I bet she didn't think to herself, I bet I lost that patron.

940
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,520
 I don't think she was, I don't think she's thinking anything.

941
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,760
 As someone who works early in the morning, my brain doesn't really kick in until about

942
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,040
 two hours onto my shift.

943
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
 Oh, you're right.

944
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
 You're right, Paul.

945
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,400
 An hour later, she's like, I shouldn't have charged him for that.

946
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,000
 I should have given him a doughnut.

947
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,680
 She probably, yeah, probably.

948
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
 Maybe.

949
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,360
 You're probably right.

950
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,960
 You know, you're just kind of like going through the motions of, I gotta do this shit, I gotta

951
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
 do that shit.

952
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
 Oh, fuck.

953
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
 Whatever.

954
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
 So.

955
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
 But she's gone.

956
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
 He's gone.

957
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
 Nope.

958
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
 Yeah.

959
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
 You're probably exactly right.

960
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
 Yeah.

961
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
 Oh, well.

962
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,960
 I'll tell you what you won't be right about.

963
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,000
 The questions in Jock vs. Nerd.

964
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 Oh, that was really, that was clever.

965
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 That was a good one.

966
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 King of the segment.

967
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Oh, am I?

968
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Fuck yeah.

969
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 I'm on the hunt for balls.

970
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 Explosion.

971
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Hunt for balls.

972
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 Hunt for balls.

973
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 On the hunt for balls.

974
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Oh.

975
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 What?

976
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:06,640
 We got a scooperty coming at us today from Scalawole Scoop.

977
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,800
 He said this is a spoof, all like spoof stuff.

978
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,000
 What did he say in his email here?

979
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,040
 Oh no, I already got rid of the email, but yeah, he said it was all like spoof stuff.

980
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:24,560
 The categories are Zazz movie spoofs, music spoofs, fake TV spoofs, and...

981
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
 Spoof-a-ree.

982
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,800
 How do you say Pope-a-ree but with spoof?

983
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
 Spoof-a-ree.

984
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
 Yeah.

985
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
 Spoof-a-ree.

986
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
 Yeah.

987
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
 Spoof-a-ree.

988
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
 Paul, you're up first.

989
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,440
 I'll take fake TV spoofs for 200, dick.

990
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
 My name is Jacob.

991
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,740
 What would you rename a critically acclaimed Apple TV series if you turned it into a zombie

992
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,140
 show about a deceased soccer coach?

993
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,800
 The Walking Dead Lasso.

994
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,240
 Oh, the Walking Dead Lasso is good.

995
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
 What is Dead Lasso?

996
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
 Yeah.

997
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
 Nice.

998
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
 Nice.

999
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
 That's me.

1000
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,040
 I'll try the spoof-a-ree for 200.

1001
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,760
 Some consider this the greatest spoof of all time, making fun of the French by making fun

1002
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,900
 of the British.

1003
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:13,440
 It spawned its own Broadway musical spoof named after canned meat that a rather famous

1004
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,760
 audio guy worked on.

1005
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,760
 That would be Vienna, the musical.

1006
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
 Spamalot.

1007
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,760
 Vienna.

1008
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
 What?

1009
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
 No.

1010
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,680
 Oh, it spawned one of the movie name, not the musical name.

1011
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
 Tricky.

1012
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,680
 Wow.

1013
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
 You got spoofed.

1014
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

1015
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
 Pretty sneaky, sis.

1016
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
 I got spoofed.

1017
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
 We got spoofed.

1018
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,680
 Spoofed and boofed.

1019
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,680
 I'll take spoofed and boofed.

1020
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,680
 God damn it, Teen Wolf.

1021
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
 Fake TV sports.

1022
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
 Fake TV.

1023
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
 There's no sports.

1024
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,680
 Fake TV spoofs.

1025
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
 Oh, spoofs.

1026
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,680
 You wouldn't need to change the name of this TV show if the Muppets took it over, and instead

1027
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,680
 of the more obvious choice of the Swedish chef used Fozzie as the lead character, Rizzo

1028
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
 would be hilarious as Richie.

1029
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
 The Bear.

1030
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
 The Bear.

1031
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,680
 The Bear.

1032
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
 The Bear.

1033
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:09,680
 What is the Bear?

1034
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,680
 Paul.

1035
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,680
 I'll try Zazz Movie Spoofs.

1036
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,680
 I'm intrigued.

1037
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,680
 Zazz Movie Spoofs for $200.

1038
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,680
 Daily Double.

1039
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
 Oh my God.

1040
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
 I wasn't ready.

1041
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,680
 I hope you were really intrigued.

1042
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:32,680
 This spoof franchise has almost as many films as the horror franchise that inspired the

1043
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,680
 spoofing.

1044
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,680
 David Zucker directed parts three and four with a writing assistant by Abrahams for number

1045
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
 four.

1046
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,680
 Scary Movie, I believe.

1047
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,680
 Scary Movie is correct.

1048
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,680
 Yay.

1049
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,680
 Which was the original title of Scream.

1050
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
 Oh yeah.

1051
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
 That's right.

1052
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
 It's me.

1053
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,680
 I'll try Music Spoofs for $200.

1054
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,680
 Coolio wasn't so cool about Weird Al making this spoof, but we can see why as some could

1055
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,320
 argue that it's gone on to eclipse the original song it's based on.

1056
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,680
 Even Ezekiel thinks it's a better song.

1057
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
 Let's see.

1058
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,680
 So let me reread the question carefully this time so I know what it's actually asking me

1059
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,680
 for.

1060
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,680
 It's asking you for the spoof, not the original.

1061
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,680
 So cool about Weird Al making this spoof.

1062
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,680
 This spoof is called Amish Paradise, which is a spoof of Coolio's Gangster's Paradise.

1063
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,680
 There you go.

1064
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
 There we are.

1065
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,680
 Raid the question carefully and get the answer correct.

1066
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
 Matt!

1067
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,680
 Are you at barn raisings often?

1068
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
 Fake TV spoofs.

1069
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,680
 For $600.

1070
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,680
 Already spoofed by this podcast, this Netflix series title would work as a reality show

1071
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,680
 pitting princes or princesses against one another or a real 100 meter dash to determine

1072
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,680
 royal bloodlines.

1073
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,680
 Sill wouldn't be as funny as the real series though.

1074
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,680
 Is this is so the original?

1075
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
 Oh, oh, I get it.

1076
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,680
 It's spoofed by this podcast, this podcast being this podcast, Matt, like our podcast.

1077
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,680
 Yes.

1078
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,680
 This one right here.

1079
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,680
 We have made fun of this Netflix series.

1080
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
 Yes.

1081
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,680
 It is a current Netflix series that we have discussed at length.

1082
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,680
 Quarter lengths, half lengths, full lengths, all the lengths.

1083
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
 Yes.

1084
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,680
 The Crown?

1085
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,680
 I don't think The Crown is a reality show.

1086
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
 All right.

1087
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,680
 I'll pass.

1088
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,680
 I'm missing it.

1089
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
 Paul!

1090
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,680
 It's the...

1091
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,680
 Oh, if Paul misses it now, it's great.

1092
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,680
 No, no, no.

1093
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,680
 It's called Race for the Crown.

1094
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,680
 Race for the Crown.

1095
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,680
 Oh, I'm dumb.

1096
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
 I get it now.

1097
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
 Yeah.

1098
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
 Paul!

1099
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,680
 He's just not going to get it.

1100
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,680
 We didn't need that question to determine that I was dumb, but it's a good reminder.

1101
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,680
 I'll go with Zazz Movie Spoofs.

1102
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,680
 For 400, this spoof franchise was recently rebooted and according to two young discerning

1103
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,680
 movie critics may just be the funniest movie of all time.

1104
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,680
 Move over, Ace Ventura.

1105
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,680
 That's got to be The Naked Gun.

1106
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,680
 Got to be The Naked Gun, right?

1107
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,680
 Yes.

1108
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
 Move over, Ace Ventura.

1109
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
 Oh, I can't.

1110
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,680
 I'll never make room.

1111
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,680
 That's me.

1112
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,680
 I'll try Spoof Parie for 400.

1113
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,680
 James Bond was ripe for spoofing, so it was surprising that it wasn't until the late 90s

1114
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,680
 that this character introduced us to a lot of fagina.

1115
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:38,680
 Felicity Shagwell, Robin Swallows, and the twins, Fook Me and Fook You.

1116
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:47,680
 That would be the International Man of Mystery whose name is not Maxwell Smart.

1117
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,680
 His name is definitely not Maxwell Smart.

1118
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,680
 It is...

1119
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,680
 Our Man Flint.

1120
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
 Our Man Flint.

1121
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,680
 That's it.

1122
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,680
 His name was Q. His name was Austin Powers.

1123
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,680
 Isn't it funny how the brain just goes big holes in it?

1124
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
 Yeah.

1125
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
 Yep.

1126
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,680
 Matt, you're up.

1127
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,680
 Getting old is awesome.

1128
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,680
 It's so much fun.

1129
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,680
 Fake TV spoofs, please.

1130
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,680
 For 800, already a kind of a spoof of all the 80s entertainment we grew up with, this Netflix

1131
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,680
 series with a Stephen King tone and a title font has a character with a name that recalls

1132
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,680
 the hilarious line from the brilliant spoof, "This is Spinal Tap."

1133
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,680
 Man, I don't know.

1134
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,680
 I have no idea.

1135
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,680
 Does that go to me?

1136
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,680
 Paul, it goes to you.

1137
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,680
 Yeah.

1138
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
 It's "Stranger Things."

1139
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
 Oh, "Stranger Things."

1140
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,680
 Because it's 11.

1141
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,680
 She goes to 11.

1142
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,680
 Well, okay.

1143
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
 Do you remember 11?

1144
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
 Did you see...

1145
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
 I remember Spinal Tap.

1146
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,680
 Did you see that Spinal Tap played a secret show in front of the actual Stonehenge?

1147
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,680
 Yes.

1148
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
 Fucking crazy.

1149
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,680
 And they're coming out with a new Spinal Tap as well.

1150
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,680
 Just hesitate and cheat because people keep taping the real answers into the chat.

1151
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,680
 It's an honor system, Matt.

1152
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,680
 I don't look at the chat.

1153
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,680
 You can just close the chat, too, if you're too tempted.

1154
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,680
 Paul, you're up.

1155
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
 I can't see the chat.

1156
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,680
 When I share the screen, I can't see the chat.

1157
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,680
 How did you make marks on the screen?

1158
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,680
 I didn't do it.

1159
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,680
 Did Newman do that?

1160
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,680
 I don't know.

1161
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,680
 You did the Daz Movie spoofs for $600.

1162
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,680
 How would Newman do it?

1163
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
 Newman's walking outside in the park.

1164
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,680
 I don't know.

1165
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,680
 You did that somehow, Jacob.

1166
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,680
 I didn't do it.

1167
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,680
 Hold on.

1168
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680
 Stop sharing the screen.

1169
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,680
 Don't come back.

1170
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,680
 I don't know what that is.

1171
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,680
 Some of the marks suddenly appeared on the screen.

1172
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,680
 The granddaddy of the spoof genre.

1173
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
 What now?

1174
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,680
 Why is Newman who he suspected of drawing on there?

1175
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,680
 Because Newman's name popped up when it was appearing.

1176
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,680
 Newman, you can unmute if you feel offended, if you feel attacked.

1177
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,680
 Go ahead, Newman.

1178
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,680
 Have I offended your delicate sensibilities?

1179
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:19,680
 Little out of left field, buddy.

1180
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:29,680
 Okay, so for people who are listening, all of a sudden on the shared screen, marks just appeared on it.

1181
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,680
 And on my screen, next to those marks, it had the name Newman.

1182
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
 All right.

1183
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,680
 I'm actively trying to mark on your face.

1184
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,680
 Damn it.

1185
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
 Spoof.

1186
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
 Oh, no.

1187
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,680
 He got spoof in my eye.

1188
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,680
 Thanks for having me.

1189
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,680
 Always a pleasure.

1190
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,680
 The granddaddy of the spoof genre.

1191
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,680
 Paul, this is your question.

1192
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:05,680
 This film had its own sequel and made fun of disaster films, Saturday Night Fever, From Here to Eternity, and Zero Hour.

1193
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,680
 It might encourage you to order lasagna on your next flight.

1194
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,680
 Airplane.

1195
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,680
 Airplane.

1196
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,680
 Absolutely.

1197
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,680
 Hell, yeah.

1198
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,680
 See, it's me.

1199
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,680
 I'll try movie spoofs for 800.

1200
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,680
 I still don't know what Zazz means.

1201
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
 Does anybody know what Zazz means?

1202
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,680
 I don't.

1203
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
 Somebody in the chat.

1204
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,680
 It might just be one of those things that this movie's got Zazz.

1205
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,680
 Got Zazz.

1206
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,680
 It could be that thing.

1207
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,680
 This Zazz classic stars Val Kilmer.

1208
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
 Oh, Zucker, Abram Zucker.

1209
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
 It is.

1210
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
 Okay, so it's all Zucker films.

1211
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,680
 Oh, gotcha.

1212
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,680
 Okay.

1213
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:46,680
 This Zazz classic stars Val Kilmer and riffs on old war films, Elvis era musicals, Blue Lagoon, and spy movies.

1214
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,680
 It all sounds like some bad movie.

1215
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,680
 Ah, you shouldn't hang me on a hook.

1216
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,680
 My father hung me on a hook once.

1217
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,680
 Once.

1218
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,680
 That and that movie, it's not Spies Like Us.

1219
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,680
 Nope, it sure isn't.

1220
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,680
 You could pass.

1221
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,680
 I know I could pass, Paul.

1222
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,680
 I know how the fucking game works, Paul.

1223
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,680
 I know what I'm able to do by the rules of the game.

1224
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,680
 I'm encouraging you to pass, that's all.

1225
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,680
 That we invented?

1226
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,680
 Oh, shit.

1228
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
 That is.

1229
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:34,680
 That's not right.

1230
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,680
 Fuck.

1231
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,680
 Again, close.

1232
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
 All I can think of is Spies Like Us.

1233
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,680
 Okay.

1234
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:47,680
 Man, I saw that movie a bunch, too.

1235
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,680
 Man.

1236
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,680
 I guess I'll pass, Matt.

1237
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
 Top secret.

1238
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,680
 Top secret, motherfucker.

1239
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,680
 Correct.

1240
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,680
 By the way, the same thing would have happened if I got the question.

1241
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,680
 I would have frozen.

1242
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,680
 It happens.

1243
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,680
 You struggle and pop right into my head.

1244
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,680
 It happens.

1245
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,680
 That's how it works.

1246
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,680
 Matt, you got spoofs or spoofs.

1247
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
 Music spoofs or spoo-per-ee.

1248
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
 I got to gain ground on Paul here, huh?

1249
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
 Oh, yeah.

1250
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,680
 Paul has 2,800.

1251
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
 Matt has 1,200.

1252
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,680
 I have 400.

1253
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
 Thanks a lot, top secret.

1254
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,680
 And there are five questions left.

1255
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,680
 One daily double left.

1256
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,680
 I'll take spoo-per-ee for 800, please.

1257
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
 All right.

1258
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,680
 The legendary director of this film and so many classic spoofs

1259
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,680
 recently announced a much anticipated sequel.

1260
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,680
 No telling if it's going to suck or blow, but one thing's for certain,

1261
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,680
 the merchandise is where the real money is made.

1262
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
 The search for more money.

1263
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,680
 Spaceballs.

1264
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,680
 Let's see.

1265
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,680
 Oh, wait.

1266
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1267
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,680
 This film.

1268
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,680
 Stop, stop, stop.

1269
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
 Mel Brooks.

1270
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,680
 Woo.

1271
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,680
 Spaceballs.

1272
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
 Thanks.

1273
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
 You saved it.

1274
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,680
 Well, the first line sounds like it's asking for the director and the movie.

1275
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,680
 It does, yeah.

1276
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,680
 Paul, you're up.

1277
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,680
 Music spoofs, please.

1278
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,680
 For 400.

1279
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,680
 This spoof.

1280
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,680
 See, Newman's name just popped back up on my screen again.

1281
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
 What are you doing, Newman?

1282
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,680
 Why are you messing with this game so much?

1283
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,680
 You did it.

1284
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,680
 This spoof of MacArthur Park has one of Weird Al's best videos rendered in

1285
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,680
 classic California raisin style stop motion claymation.

1286
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,680
 They certainly spared no expense.

1287
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,680
 As Jurassic Park.

1288
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,680
 Oh.

1289
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,680
 Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

1290
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,680
 All the dinosaurs are running wild.

1291
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,680
 Beautiful.

1292
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
 Yes.

1293
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,680
 Beautiful.

1294
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,680
 Let's see.

1295
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,680
 It's me.

1296
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
 I guess I need to avoid the daily doubles.

1297
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
 So hopefully I can't win.

1298
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,680
 It doesn't matter.

1299
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,680
 Music spoofs.

1300
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,680
 800.

1301
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,680
 A fantastic reminder of grammar rules that any teacher would love.

1302
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,680
 Weird Al's Word Crimes is a spoof of the big hit that many retroactively

1303
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,680
 deemed to be a bit rapey and was considered a crime itself.

1304
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,680
 The subject of several lawsuits.

1305
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:24,680
 That is the classic song Long Distance.

1306
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,680
 Long Distance.

1307
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
 That's right.

1308
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:34,680
 I mean, if you read between the lines, it's pretty dark.

1309
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,680
 I have no idea.

1310
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,680
 I passed, Matt.

1311
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
 Grammar rules.

1312
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,680
 Teacher would love Weird Al's Word Crimes.

1313
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:48,680
 It's a big hit song that many retroactively deemed a bit rapey.

1314
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,680
 Scoop and Overgirl just typed Blurred Lines in the chat.

1315
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
 I'm going to go with Blurred Lines.

1316
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,680
 You're cheating ass.

1317
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,680
 It is Blurred Lines.

1318
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,680
 Well done, Matt.

1319
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
 I was going to say it's a--

1320
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,680
 Well done, Matt Donnelly and only Matt Donnelly.

1321
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,680
 The song had some growing pains.

1322
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,680
 Ah, growing pains.

1323
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
 There you go.

1324
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,680
 Matt, you got Spoof, Spoof, Spoof, Puri.

1325
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
 That's a good hint, Paul.

1326
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,680
 That was a good hint.

1327
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,680
 Just play this episode backwards and it'll make sense.

1328
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,680
 That'll be good.

1329
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,680
 It was Alan Thicke's Rapist Child.

1330
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:25,680
 Allegedly.

1331
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
 Is it my turn?

1332
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,680
 I don't know.

1333
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
 Alan Thicke had more than one kid.

1334
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,680
 Yes.

1335
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,680
 Eddie?

1336
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,680
 I'll take Spoof Puri, please.

1337
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,680
 For 600.

1338
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,680
 The way the amazing cast of Rickman, Rockwell, and Weaver played it so straight in this film

1339
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,680
 truly makes it an underappreciated spoofing of the Star Trek series.

1340
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:52,680
 Let us know if anyone in ICS ever worked in a situation similar to this film.

1341
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,680
 Oh, shoot.

1342
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,680
 This happened to me.

1343
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
 It's about the Jacob.

1344
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,680
 The name would be in my head right now.

1345
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,680
 I never know the name of this name.

1346
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
 Our whole gang went to go see it.

1347
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,680
 It was really a fun day.

1348
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1349
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,680
 Everybody from the experience went to go see it.

1350
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,680
 I'm just stalling for someone to just type in the chat.

1351
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
 No, don't do that.

1352
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,680
 That's race for the crown.

1353
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,680
 There you go.

1354
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
 Thank you.

1355
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,680
 Also race for the crown.

1356
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,680
 I'll pass.

1357
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,680
 That passes by the game rules.

1358
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,680
 That passes to Paul.

1359
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,680
 I think it actually passes to me though.

1360
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,680
 It's called Galaxy Quest.

1361
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,680
 Galaxy Quest is it.

1362
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,680
 And Paul closing out the category.

1363
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,680
 Now I'm stuck with the double, right?

1364
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,680
 Music spoofs for 600.

1365
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,680
 Daily double.

1366
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
 This is it.

1367
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,680
 This is the fucking biggie.

1368
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,680
 For all 3,800 and the win.

1369
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,680
 Oh, man.

1370
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,680
 For first place or last place.

1371
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,680
 AI really took it to one of the legendary Beatles.

1372
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,680
 Oh, it's not AI.

1373
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,680
 That would be Al.

1374
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,680
 Al really took it to one of the legendary Beatles when he quite accurately spoofed this

1375
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:07,680
 song by writing his own version entitled This Song's Just six words long.

1376
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,680
 There's more lyrical craft in Al's version than the original.

1377
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,680
 It's I Got My Mind Set on You by George Harrison.

1378
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,680
 I Got My Mind Set on You by George Harrison.

1379
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,680
 I'm sorry, Paul.

1380
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,680
 It's Got My Mind Set on You, not I Got My Mind Set on You.

1381
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
 Oh, tough day.

1382
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,680
 That's a loss, Paul.

1383
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,680
 I'm sorry.

1384
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,680
 You're right.

1385
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,680
 It's a rough game, Paul.

1386
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,680
 Oh, sure.

1387
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,680
 Top but true.

1388
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,680
 I mean, it is seven words instead of six.

1389
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,680
 That's right.

1390
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,680
 That is the game.

1391
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,680
 We'll give Paul the win with 7,600 points.

1392
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,680
 Matt's gotten second with 2,800.

1393
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,680
 I've got third with 400.

1394
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,680
 Thanks a lot, Top Secret.

1395
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,680
 And that is from Scala Wall Scoop.

1396
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,680
 Thank you, Scala Wall Scoop.

1397
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,680
 If you want to send us a scooperty or a Price is Right jock versus nerd or an obelisk jock

1398
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,680
 versus nerd or just some good old fashioned scoop mail, head over to HeyScoops.com right

1399
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,680
 there on the home page.

1400
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:05,680
 You can do all those things at HeyScoops.com where you can also buy yourself some tickets

1401
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
 to Scoop Fest.

1402
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
 Buy tickets to Scoop Fest.

1403
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,680
 It's going to be awesome.

1404
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,680
 I saw some chats.

1405
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:19,680
 Jacob, make sure you're checking the messages coming through Scoop Group or the Instant

1406
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,680
 Messenger on the old Facebook.

1407
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,680
 Somebody wanted to buy an extra ticket for the barbecue for their wife.

1408
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,680
 I'm not checking anything on Facebook, but if you want to buy an extra ticket to the

1409
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,680
 barbecue, go to HeyScoops.com.

1410
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,680
 Click on it.

1411
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,680
 Buy an extra ticket to the barbecue because there are a couple of tickets on there.

1412
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,680
 There are some tickets on there.

1413
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,680
 We've expanded the barbecue tickets.

1414
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,680
 And I even told Eric the other day, we were talking about it a little bit.

1415
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,680
 I think at this point, if anybody wants to come to the barbecue, sorry, not if anybody

1416
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,680
 wants to come to the barbecue, if anyone would like to purchase tickets to the barbecue and

1417
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,680
 come to the barbecue, we'll figure out a way to make it happen at this point.

1418
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,680
 So come on down.

1419
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,680
