1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,280
 Oh, hello there.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,080
 I am so glad you are here

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,120
 because I would like to thank the ice cream truck drivers.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,840
 Who are the ice cream truck drivers?

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,240
 Well, those are the folks to deliver that fucking ice cream

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
 straight to your fucking ear holes.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,760
 Right now, I'd like to thank

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,840
 Darth Scooper,

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,960
 David Walker,

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,160
 Ted Laszlo,

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,440
 Dirty Old Scoop,

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,760
 Dr. Scoop Little,

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,880
 and Elton Magic Scoop.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,920
 If you want to be an ice cream truck driver,

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,600
 just like these fine folks,

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,160
 head over to preachingfun.com

18
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,140
 that's where you can go to sign up

19
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,480
 to be an ice cream truck driver

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,280
 and who knows,

21
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840
 the life you save.

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,380
 Ah, the fade out button didn't work.

23
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,220
 It was the--

24
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,760
 (laughing)

25
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,600
 - That was the stop button?

26
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,080
 - To be fair, to be fair,

27
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,540
 I suppose the fade out button might work.

28
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,380
 I haven't tested it,

29
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,620
 but the stop button works effectively.

30
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,460
 - Okay, good.

31
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,280
 - Yeah.

32
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,120
 - All right.

33
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,960
 - The stop button works just fine.

34
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,080
 - I literally was like, wait, do you have to start over?

35
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,280
 Like, what's happening?

36
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,300
 - No, no, no.

37
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,760
 I'm covering it with all of this.

38
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
 See, nobody even noticed it

39
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
 because I covered the lack of a music fade

40
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,160
 with this clever banter.

41
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,240
 (laughing)

42
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,400
 - Hey, Johnny,

43
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,080
 do you want to go to an ice cream social?

44
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,480
 - Yeah, I'd love to.

45
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,920
 - Great, let's go.

46
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
 (upbeat music)

47
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,300
 - Oh, I'm so excited, guys.

48
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,000
 We're broadcasting from Core Sensors

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
 in Morristown, New Jersey.

50
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,440
 (laughing)

51
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,800
 I'm in a conference room.

52
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,320
 - Yo, very nice cabin.

53
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 - Yeah.

54
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
 - Nice cabin in the cabin.

55
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,920
 (upbeat music)

56
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,840
 - It's time for Matt Godley's Ice Cream Social.

57
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
 Sitting in Jersey, it's Matt Godley.

58
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,880
 Sitting in Pittsburgh, it's Paul Mattingly.

59
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,840
 Sitting in Vegas, it's me,

60
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,160
 taking the audio guide.

61
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,000
 We're preaching fun.

62
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
 - Oh, that's where you're wrong.

63
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
 I don't know if I can break a computer with that.

64
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,800
 - I couldn't see, what's in there?

65
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,240
 - Pressure sensors and pressure transducers.

66
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,720
 - That's what's on display.

67
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,100
 - That's what's made and sold here.

68
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,000
 - Do you have an in with the pressure sensor

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,760
 and transducer mafia?

70
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
 - I do.

71
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,440
 - What's going on?

72
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,260
 - I do.

73
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
 - Who's your hookup?

74
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,160
 - I've been connected to the pressure transducer industry

75
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,400
 for quite some time.

76
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
 - Is it true?

77
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
 - Yes.

78
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,880
 - Who's your pressure transducer pimp?

79
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,240
 - Who's your pressure transducer guy, Matt?

80
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
 - One of my original roommates

81
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,940
 in my party house of Fort La Forge, my buddy Sam.

82
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,640
 - So the ones that are on display in that cabin.

83
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
 - Where was this one last week

84
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,320
 when I was like, I need new pressure transducers.

85
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,440
 Where were you then?

86
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,920
 - I don't want you to take it up my supply.

87
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,160
 - Come on.

88
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,320
 - The ones that I'm seeing in that cabinet,

89
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,960
 are those on display as check out the hotness

90
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,720
 or are they our vaunted history?

91
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
 What is this?

92
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,400
 What am I seeing?

93
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,220
 - I don't even know.

94
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,060
 I wasn't given a clue.

95
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,900
 - Or are they free samples?

96
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,160
 - I was, 'cause here's the thing.

97
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
 So my buddy Sammy, it's his company.

98
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,220
 I'm staying at his house.

99
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,960
 His office is closer to my magic show

100
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
 that I have to literally, as soon as we wrap,

101
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
 I'm leaving and going to do two magic shows.

102
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
 - Oh, okay.

103
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,360
 - And he said, "And the internet's stronger here."

104
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,160
 So he said, "Let's just sit you up in my conference room."

105
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,240
 - What a nice guy.

106
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,000
 - Yes, he's a very nice guy.

107
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,140
 And so, yeah, I did not get the two penny tour though.

108
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,740
 So I'm very curious myself as to what is on display

109
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,520
 on these shelves as well.

110
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,720
 - And I assume when you leave,

111
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
 you will be given several pressure transducers.

112
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
 - Oh yeah, I gotta bring the kids home.

113
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
 There's something.

114
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,220
 - Does he end every sales call?

115
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,940
 Does he end every sales call with, "No pressure."

116
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,200
 (laughing)

117
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,120
 - No, no, no, no.

118
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
 - Good, 'cause that would be the end of his business.

119
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,920
 - He did tell me something.

120
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
 So he gets, you know, he's a business owner.

121
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
 He gets cold called all the time and spam called.

122
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
 - Sure.

123
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,920
 - Ah.

124
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,440
 - He found out if I should betray this or not.

125
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
 - Oh shit, here we go.

126
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,360
 Getting the fucking pressure sensor tea, y'all.

127
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
 - There it is.

128
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do, do ♪

129
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360

134
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,660
 - So--

135
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,360
 - It's our new segment on the show.

136
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
 - If you're spam called by someone in India.

137
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,640
 - Uh-huh.

138
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 - There's a term, you can use an insult in India

139
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,400
 that basically makes people break script

140
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,240
 and either curse you out or hang up on the spot.

141
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
 - Wow.

142
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,900
 - No.

143
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,820
 - Yes.

144
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,600
 - There's a magic super curse

145
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
 that we could be using this whole time?

146
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,020
 - Yes.

147
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,040
 And it basically translates to basically sister fucker.

148
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
 Like you're--

149
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
 - Okay.

150
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
 - You fuck your sister.

151
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
 - It's a good one.

152
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,360
 - So we're implying that they have more fun

153
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,200
 than they're comfortable having, is what you're saying.

154
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,980
 - It's pronounced, you know, Ben shot.

155
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,660
 That's how you pronounce, that's the term.

156
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,500
 So right now we just got--

157
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,340
 - What did you say to me?

158
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,960
 - Exactly, we just got flagged.

159
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,200
 - We apologize to our Indian listeners right now

160
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,820
 who are zooming into their phones.

161
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,880
 - We just got, and he indeed proved it to me.

162
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
 He took a spam call while we were having breakfast.

163
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,920
 - Huh?

164
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,300
 - There was someone trying to buy his home.

165
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,140
 - Uh-huh.

166
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,960
 - And they said how much?

167
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,080
 And he goes, "About 140, 150 Ben shots."

168
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,040
 And the person hung up the phone immediately.

169
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
 - Hilarious.

170
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,400
 (laughing)

171
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,060
 150 Ben shots.

172
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,320
 This is one of those terrible things

173
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,880
 because on one hand I feel it's a little punching down

174
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,380
 because the person running the phone

175
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,640
 isn't the asshole who's doing all of the shitty things,

176
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,440
 but they are the one actively doing it.

177
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,700
 So it's, yeah, I don't know.

178
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,540
 I do like it though.

179
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,360
 I like having a magic word just in these phones.

180
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,840
 - It's a good solution, nobody gets hurt.

181
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
 - I've been getting a lot of phone calls lately

182
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,940
 from numbers that I don't have saved,

183
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,800
 so I've been answering unknown numbers

184
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,520
 when they're popping up.

185
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,960
 And yeah, so I've been getting hit

186
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,840
 with a couple of good spams lately.

187
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,880
 And I'm glad to have a code.

188
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,840
 - I really couldn't believe it.

189
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,240
 - Yeah.

190
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,200
 - When I saw it in action, I was like, "Oh my gosh."

191
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
 - Yeah, I'm seeing in the chat with a T,

192
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,880
 it's with a D, shah-duh.

193
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,320
 - Oh, shah-duh.

194
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,720
 - Which part of it is, is it a direct translation?

196
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,680
 Does shah-duh mean like fucker?

197
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,240
 - I mean, I think like it's like a, to a degree,

198
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,320
 like the ultimate degree, right?

199
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,160
 - Okay.

200
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
 - Like I know like in Italian you can say like Blanco

201
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
 or like, you know, whatever that means white.

202
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
 But if you say like Blanchesumo,

203
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
 it means like the most whitest white.

204
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
 I said that to somebody.

205
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,080
 - How do you know that, Matt?

206
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,480
 - I was joking with an Italian where I was talking

207
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,920
 about whether I was good at basketball like my brother.

208
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,840
 And I said, I was not only Blanco, but Blanchesumo.

209
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,760
 I was the most white and it made him laugh really hard.

210
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,600
 - It's weird that basketball is the place

211
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,960
 where we get to talk about race

212
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,840
 with the least amount of concern.

213
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,680
 - Right.

214
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,480
 - No, yeah, yeah. - It's in life.

215
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,640
 It's really kind of nice.

216
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,440
 - I was, you know, hanging out on the ship.

217
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
 I just got off yesterday.

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,120
 And one of the artists was, he was from Israel.

219
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,960
 He lives in, you know, the United States currently,

220
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,560
 but it was from Israel.

221
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,360
 And we were out with a black comedian.

222
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,120
 This great comedian named Orlando Baxter.

223
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
 - Okay.

224
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,200
 - And I already had some like weird conversations

225
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,840
 with my Israeli friend as he would drift

226
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
 into certain politics from time to time.

227
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,280
 - Oh, he had interesting views

228
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,000
 that you didn't necessarily find incredibly comfortable

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,960
 to talk about?

230
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
 - Yes.

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,120
 - Oh, okay, okay, interesting.

232
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,920
 - And somehow the topic came over to the Cosby show.

233
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,080
 (laughing)

234
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,760
 And then the fact that Malcolm Jamal Warner

235
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,720
 had died recently.

236
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,960
 - Oh, that's right, yeah.

237
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
 - He had died drowning in--

238
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,600
 - Yeah, swimming, yeah, it was terrible.

239
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
 - Costa Rica.

240
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
 - Trying to save his daughter.

241
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,200
 Did his daughter live?

242
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,480
 - I don't know.

243
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
 - I believe so.

244
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,520
 - Okay.

245
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,360
 - I'll find out.

246
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,760
 - And this person then made a joke

247
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,720
 about black people in swimming and I excused myself

248
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,760
 from the table and went to the bathroom.

249
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,000
 - Oh dear, oh my.

250
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
 (laughing)

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
 - Because you were laughing so hard

252
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,640
 you were gonna push yourself.

253
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,680
 (laughing)

254
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,640
 - Jesus Christ.

255
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,880
 Oh, God damn it, God damn it.

256
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
 What the fuck is wrong with people?

257
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,400
 - No.

258
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,240
 (laughing)

259
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,320
 And then he brings up that, Orlando brings up

260
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,720
 that his wife is indeed a chemist from Harvard

261
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,880
 and then my mentalist friend then brought up

262
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,120
 that Harvard was supporting genocide in Sudan

263
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
 and that he should be mad at Harvard.

264
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,280
 (laughing)

265
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,200
 - And then Matt had to excuse himself again

266
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,440
 because he was laughing hysterically again.

267
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,720
 - Why, why, who taught you that this is the way

268
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,080
 to have conversation?

269
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,760
 (laughing)

270
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
 - All right, this was so similar.

271
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,200
 My mom used to teach, when my mom was a college professor

272
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,400
 she would teach all of these international students

273
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,560
 and it was not uncommon around the holidays

274
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,360
 for an international student or eight

275
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,480
 to show up at the house for the big holiday meal

276
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,080
 because she would invite them over

277
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,520
 because they didn't have family or whatever in the area

278
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,480
 to go spend the holidays with.

279
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,920
 And there was this cat one time,

280
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,080
 never saw him again, never met him before

281
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,240
 but he was just an Israeli student of my mom's

282
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,040
 and I remember his, because he was Israeli,

283
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,760
 he had been in the Israeli military

284
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
 before coming over to the US to go to college

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,120
 and his job in the Israeli military had been peel potatoes.

286
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,000
 He had worked as a cook and so he was like,

287
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,180
 I peel thousands of potatoes a day,

288
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,440
 let me peel the potatoes for dinner,

289
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,720
 I can peel them instantly and he could.

290
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
 We gave him a potato peeler at first

291
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,000
 and he was like, I don't know how to use a potato peeler,

292
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
 I just need a knife.

293
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,940
 And so I got him like a little paring knife

294
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,600
 and he peeled enough potatoes for like,

295
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
 there were probably 20 of us at the house that day,

296
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,540
 he peeled enough potatoes for everyone

297
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,760
 in like a minute and a half, it was incredible to watch.

298
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,160
 - That's awesome.

299
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,720
 - But I was over there, I was probably in junior high,

300
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,080
 maybe young high school or something like that

301
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,720
 and I was over there and he was telling me about

302
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 like Israeli military and telling me jokes

303
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
 about Israeli military or jokes

304
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,880
 that they would tell each other in the Israeli military.

305
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,240
 And yeah, as a young teenager, I was like,

306
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,680
 I need to not be in this conversation,

307
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,360
 this guy is saying things that I am not.

308
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,680
 This is his thing, I'm gonna go piss myself in the bathroom.

309
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,600
 - He has forgotten the first rule, the potatoes have eyes.

310
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,440
 - That's right.

311
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,680
 - You can't just go around behaving however you want

312
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,640
 around the spuds, yes.

313
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,520
 - Malcolm Jamal's, Warner's daughter was saved,

314
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,200
 she was saved by a surfer, so yeah, she was okay.

315
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,660
 - Cowabunga, dude, what happened to Theo?

316
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
 No way, gnarly.

317
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:55,080
 - Matt, were there any jokes you wanted to repeat

318
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,160
 about Theo Huxtable drowning?

319
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,520
 - No, no, no.

320
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,480
 - Oh, interesting, okay.

321
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,520
 - No, I didn't think of any in the bathroom

322
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
 when I walked away.

323
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,200
 I didn't think of any.

324
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
 - Oh God.

325
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,520
 - I just saw a preview for something last night

326
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,800
 with Malcolm Jamal Warner in it,

327
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,640
 and I was like, oh shit.

328
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,680
 - Oh no, yeah, yeah.

329
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,400
 - Was it the ocean?

330
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,720
 - I know, that was what it was, it was Davy Jones locker.

331
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,800
 - Yeah, no, no, that wasn't even

332
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
 the only awkward conversation.

333
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,800
 - Oh, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet.

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,640
 - It wasn't even the most awkward conversation.

335
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,600
 - You know, if I gave a damn enough to wanna talk to people,

336
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,520
 I'm sure I'd have a lot of fuckin' awkward conversation.

337
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
 - Right, right.

338
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,120
 - I don't push myself, you're a bold man.

339
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,600
 Also, you're stuck on a boat, it happens on boats.

340
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can't, you know,

341
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,080
 we all have to like, what am I gonna do,

342
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,560
 like, you know, get irate and then spend the last three days

343
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,760
 giving someone the silent treatment

344
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,720
 for not walking around the ship?

345
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
 - Yeah, and you're gonna see 'em every five minutes.

346
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
 - Yeah, exactly.

347
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
 - You're playing pinball with people on the ships.

348
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

349
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,440
 - No, no.

350
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
 Oh, speaking of awkward conversations,

351
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,360
 I forgot to talk about this one.

352
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 I went out with Rondell Sheridan when we went out.

353
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
 - Oh, yes.

354
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,080
 - We went out, and so we went to a little bar

355
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,160
 after the comedy club at the bar.

356
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
 All the staff wanna take pictures with Rondell.

357
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,960
 We get back out on the street,

358
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,160
 and the four of us are waiting for an Uber,

359
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
 and there's a gentleman, like, 10 feet off

360
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,720
 of our conversation who just sees us jokin' around.

361
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
 - Ah, good.

362
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,440
 - Decides to insert himself.

363
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,280
 - And he was into his cups.

364
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,760
 - Oh, yes!

365
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
 - Oh, dear.

366
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,360
 - He was like--

367
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,640
 - You met the mayor.

368
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,880
 - He was, I met the mayor.

369
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,000
 He literally, and he literally just stumbled towards us.

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,080
 (laughing)

371
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,960
 He had this big maroon UMass sweatshirt on over shorts.

372
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
 - Fuck yeah.

373
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,480
 - And he had a perfect newly for my first mustache,

374
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
 like, 22 years old.

375
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 My first bushy mustache-like mustache.

376
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,960
 That looked like it was put on by a costume person

377
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,960
 and didn't belong on him.

378
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,320
 And he literally, while wobbling,

379
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
 smiles ear to ear and goes, "Can I get in on this?"

380
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,840
 (laughing)

381
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 - Damn it!

382
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,280
 - And that person is a hero.

383
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,840
 - Damn it, damn it.

384
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,880
 Can I get in on, what the hell?

385
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
 Can I get in on this?

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
 - Y'all having a good time?

387
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,360
 Let me get in on this good time.

388
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,880
 - Oh my God.

389
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,480
 - You look like a bunch of good time fellas.

390
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,320
 Let me get in on this.

391
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,520
 - Good Lord, can I get in on this?

392
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,600
 - And then like, we just like, I hear that,

393
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
 but my two friends are still talking,

394
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,440
 like, just keep talking, you know?

395
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
 - Yeah.

396
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,600
 - And he's like, and he's just like leaning in

397
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,680
 and going, "Uh, yeah."

398
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,600
 (laughing)

399
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,920
 - Seamless transition.

400
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,640
 - Just like, like as if he's like,

401
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,720
 camouflaging into a party or something.

402
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,880
 But like, it's just the four of us.

403
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,200
 - This is great!

404
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,360
 - Can I get in on this?

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,200
 - And the other three are like, just like,

406
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,280
 including Ronella, just like, not, like looking at me,

407
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,920
 like, I am not engaging this man, right?

408
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
 But he like, is not gonna get in here.

409
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,680
 - Oh, because they don't wanna live.

410
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
 - And he is staying like, two-dimensionally confident.

411
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,880
 Like, he is just still doing like, listening,

412
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,960
 like, eyebrows and listening ears and like,

413
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,640
 he literally puts like, an arm up like a teapot,

414
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
 like a teapot arm.

415
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,080
 (laughing)

416
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,480
 - I am in this conversation.

417
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,320
 - Like, uh-huh, uh-huh.

418
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,680
 - This is a conversation that I'm gonna be a part of.

419
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,720
 - Finally, just go like, all right,

420
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,520
 I'm gonna jump on this grenade, I'll isolate.

421
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,120
 And I just, I just square to him and I go like,

422
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,160
 you doing all right, pal?

423
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,080
 You having a good night?

424
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,960
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

425
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 You guys seem like a lot of fun.

426
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
 You guys, you guys like comedy?

427
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
 I like comedy.

428
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
 You like comedy?

429
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,960
 And I was like, I can't tell whether he is

430
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,640
 or isn't making out Rondelle Sheridan or not.

431
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,480
 Do you know?

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
 Like, why is this happening?

433
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,600
 - As much as I have involved my life with the comedic arts.

434
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,480
 - Yeah.

435
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,600
 - I have never, ever initiated a conversation

436
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,960
 or even said the words, "I am into comedy."

437
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
 - No. - I don't think.

438
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,800
 You know what I mean?

439
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,320
 Like, I've never, I've never said that, I don't think.

440
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
 (laughing)

441
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
 I mean, I'm into comedy.

442
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,000
 You know what I mean?

443
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
 No, no.

444
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,520
 - It's in the same, it's in the same category

445
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,080
 as people who criticize jokes right after saying

446
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 that they really like to laugh.

447
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,600
 You know, I love to laugh, but you know,

448
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,120
 this joke just really pushed me in the wrong direction.

449
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
 - Right, right, right.

450
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,520
 - You know, it's that same family.

451
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
 - Oh.

452
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,480
 - My buddy.

453
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,360
 - I'm really into comedy.

454
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,200
 - My buddy, Tom, noting that I stepped in it,

455
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,720
 decides to just push me further in,

456
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
 and he goes, "Oh, if you like comedy podcasts,

457
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,920
 "he knows a bunch of people who do comedy podcasts."

458
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,040
 (laughing)

459
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,880
 - Oh, hero.

460
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
 - I mean, this is a guy to chip.

461
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
 If there was ever a guy to chip, this is a guy.

462
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,200
 (laughing)

463
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
 Get him listening.

464
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,240
 - And then I did probably one of the most obnoxious things

465
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
 I've ever done.

466
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,200
 (laughing)

467
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,960
 He keeps bringing up famous people that he likes

468
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,040
 that are funny from the improv comedy world.

469
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,880
 - Good.

470
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,700
 - Oh boy.

471
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,540
 - Do you remember any of his examples?

472
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,880
 - I'm not gonna say examples, I'm gonna tell you what I did.

473
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
 - Oh, okay, okay.

474
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
 - I got out my phone and showed that that person

475
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 was someone I could call, and then said,

476
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,760
 "But we're not gonna call him."

477
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,520
 And I would close my contacts,

478
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,440
 and he brought up someone else, I go, "Oh, sure.

479
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,920
 "Yep, we can call that person too, but we're not gonna,

480
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 "you and I are not gonna call that person right now."

481
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,760
 (laughing)

482
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,080
 - That's a good asshole move.

483
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,880
 - That's a hell of a move.

484
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,240
 - I just kept showing him all these people I knew

485
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,040
 from the UCB theater from back in the day,

486
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,820
 'cause that's what we liked from the comedy "Bang Bang"

487
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,920
 and other kind of podcast space.

488
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,340
 And he literally was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

489
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,960
 - I can't believe it.

490
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,320
 - He was like flipping out.

491
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,640
 - There's no way this could be faked.

492
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,160
 - Exactly, exactly, right?

493
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,080
 - There's no way somebody could have these names

494
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,020
 stored in their phone without the correct numbers.

495
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,920
 (laughing)

496
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,240
 - Good point, good point.

497
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,840
 I could have just been like, "Sure, Alec Baldwin, here."

498
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
 You know, whatever, just made a contact.

499
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,420
 - Look, it says Alec Baldwin.

500
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,260
 - Got it.

501
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,720
 - Isn't that the NoteZap?

502
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
 - Isn't this amazing, though, Matt?

503
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,280
 - It's not the NoteZap.

504
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,760
 - I'm just thinking this is-

505
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,320
 - Matt's NoteZap says, "Alec Baldwin, wow!"

506
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
 - We're here now, we're here now for phone.

507
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,640
 We are fully here now for phone, right?

508
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,680
 If I'd done this 30 years ago,

509
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,840
 people would have thought I was insane.

510
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
 - Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

511
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,640
 - This means phone.

512
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,120
 - Yeah, oh, you're talking about the gesture

513
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,960
 that I'm holding a brick?

514
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,680
 - My creepy claw hand means phone.

515
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

516
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,960
 - Matt's just holding up his hand to the camera

517
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,840
 like he's holding a phone.

518
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,680
 - Yeah, we don't do a hang loose-

519
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,880
 - No, we don't do that anymore.

520
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,720
 We don't even do hold like a thing, like a receiver type.

521
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 We do claw hand.

522
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,820
 - But we still do the crank thing for a car window.

523
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,880
 - We do somewhat, we do somewhat.

524
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,920
 Well, I will say that-

525
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
 - And of course, we still have the picture

526
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,040
 of the floppy disk to save things.

527
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,080
 - The car that I have right now-

528
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
 - Nobody knows what that is anymore.

529
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
 - The car that I have right now,

530
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,780
 which is just about to turn six years old,

531
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,000
 or rather 10 years old,

532
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 is the first car I've ever had with power windows.

533
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,840
 - Uh-huh.

534
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
 - So, it was only a decade ago.

535
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,980
 - Just so you know, if you ever get a text from me

536
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,700
 with a celebrity's name on it,

537
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,920
 it means you're about to get a phone call

538
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,420
 and you're supposed to be that celebrity

539
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,640
 when you answer the phone.

540
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,480
 - I, oh.

541
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,140
 - I would do that in a heartbeat.

542
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,980
 I would do that in a heartbeat.

543
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,820
 - Deal, deal.

544
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,240
 - That's a really good idea.

545
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,840
 - That is, yeah, yeah.

546
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,160
 - That'd be really fun, actually.

547
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,820
 - The three of us need to remember that.

548
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,660
 - Yes, yeah.

549
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,320
 - We should, we should remember that.

550
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,920
 That could be really good.

551
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,160
 I did a bit for Teller. - Daniel Craig.

552
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,320
 - I did a bit for Teller a couple years ago.

553
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,000
 - Oh, this is Daniel Craig, isn't it?

554
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,140
 - He had a friend that wanted his kid to talk to Batman.

555
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,100
 So I did Batman for the kid.

556
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,880
 - That's pretty great.

557
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,700
 - He ain't doing it on Batman.

558
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,540
 - On a phone call?

559
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,380
 Yeah, I did.

560
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,200
 - Ask me, Batman, what do you want?

561
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
 - It was very bail.

562
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
 It was very bail.

563
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,800
 I was like, I understand you can help me find the Joker.

564
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,860
 - Oh, nice.

565
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,840
 - And I was like, the kid was looking for the Joker

566
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,680
 for like a week.

567
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
 (laughing)

568
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,480
 I was like, yeah, totally.

569
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,440
 Keep an eye out.

570
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,520
 When you're in a parking lot, just scan.

571
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,980
 Make sure you look everywhere.

572
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,240
 (laughing)

573
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,960
 The kid started haunting the Joker.

574
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
 So yeah, I think that's a good bit, Matt.

575
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,940
 - That kid grew up to be an ICE agent.

576
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,780
 - Let's start.

577
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,360
 (laughing)

578
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,080
 - You sent him down the wrong track, man.

579
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
 - No, I don't know.

580
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,320
 I don't think they can find the Joker.

581
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
 - We have this guy that's gonna change his wife's name

582
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
 to Bob De Niro on his phone.

583
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
 That's great.

584
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,000
 (laughing)

585
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,480
 - Oh, it's me, Bob De Niro, isn't it?

586
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,320
 Now they're gonna--

587
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,560
 (laughing)

588
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,240
 - Gonna get me some bangers and mash 'em, Bob De Niro, I am.

589
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
 - You guys are just getting better and better

590
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,120
 at your PIF impression.

591
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,280
 - Yeah, we were just doing PIF the whole time.

592
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,160
 - It's true, it's true.

593
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,120
 By the way, anybody who goes to see Matt

594
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,800
 at any of the magic shows,

595
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
 if you come see Matt at a Scoop event,

596
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,480
 feel free to name celebrities

597
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,440
 and see if Matt has the name as well.

598
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,260
 (laughing)

599
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,100
 - It was obnoxious.

600
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,400
 I just, I didn't know how to, like,

601
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
 he wasn't gonna go away, so I just,

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,160
 I literally was like, it literally was like shiny keys.

603
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,800
 Like, how do I bounce shiny keys in front of his face

604
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,760
 to keep him from, I basically was like,

605
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,160
 I have to keep him from either recognizing

606
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,080
 or festering Rondell Sheridan, is what I was thinking.

607
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,800
 - It was probably, also, it was probably

608
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 the nicest thing you could do, really.

609
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

610
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,880
 - 'Cause you probably made his day, like, oh!

611
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 I'm two degrees from that guy!

612
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,000
 - Lemur Screamer Creamer wants Clooney Batman, Paul.

613
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,640
 Let's hear on Clooney Batman now.

614
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,800
 - I don't know what your game is, Freeze.

615
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,200
 (laughing)

616
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
 - Perfect.

617
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,360
 - I don't know what your game is, Robin.

618
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,740
 (laughing)

619
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,580
 I don't know what you think your game is.

620
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,880
 - Batman didn't know a lot of game.

621
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,680
 - I don't know what you think your game is, Poison Ivy.

622
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,760
 - Jesus, and Myra wants post-cancer Kilmer Batman.

623
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,600
 - Jesus.

624
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,320
 (laughing)

625
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,020
 - It's a lot quieter.

626
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,360
 - I don't know what your name is, Robin.

627
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,760
 I don't know what your game is, Batman.

628
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,300
 Wait, I'm Batman.

629
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,400
 (laughing)

630
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,880
 I don't know what your game is, Poison Ivy.

631
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,940
 - Wait, no, two vays was the one in mind.

632
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,800
 Also, the--

633
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,080
 - I'll tell you who else definitely did not feel

634
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,440
 uncomfortable by that impression,

635
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,280
 and that is the following sponsor.

636
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,200
 - Today's show is brought to you by Dicks Out for Democracy,

637
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,060
 Crouchless Shorts for your next anti-Trump rally.

638
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,320
 (laughing)

639
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:07,160
 - Hello, I am Jerry "Daisy" Duke Farlaflon.

640
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
 And I've started a company--

641
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,320
 - Of the Montana Farlaflons?

642
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,140
 - The same.

643
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,600
 Out here in God's country, we all like to free ball,

644
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,280
 but we also don't care for the rubbing of a denim.

645
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,320
 So what we've done is we have eliminated the middle man,

646
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,300
 literally.

647
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,040
 We've cut out the spot where your wiener's at

648
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,000
 in all of our jeans.

649
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,320
 And I don't sell just jeans.

650
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,600
 I sell Daisy Dukes, cut high and tight

651
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,160
 to where you can't tell if it's ass or what it is,

652
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
 because it's so high.

653
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,560
 (laughing)

654
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,800
 - Ass or other options?

655
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,320
 (laughing)

656
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,760
 - Right, ass or who can say?

657
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
 (laughing)

658
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,120
 And now we've confused the issue even further

659
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,400
 by eliminating more of the material on the jean

660
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,840
 to let your dick and balls fly loose.

661
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,680
 - That's right.

662
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,720
 Go to FreeAsYourOwnBalls.org

663
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,240
 and sign up today to get on the mailing list.

664
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,160
 We're just pre-ordering them right now.

665
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,680
 - There is nothing more democratic

666
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,120
 than crotchless Daisy Dukes

667
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,800
 and the question of what is that?

668
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 Ass or what have you?

669
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,520
 - There's a time people debated whether the snake

670
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,760
 or the turkey or the eagle was the greatest symbol

671
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,640
 of us in our rights when our own free swinging scrotum

672
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,040
 was hanging right there the whole time.

673
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,800
 - Seriously, it incorporates both snake and eagle.

674
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,040
 (laughing)

675
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,000
 Because you have the serpent-like phallus

676
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,760
 and the comfortable bald nest of the majestic eagle bird.

677
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,520
 - America, oh America. - There's nothing more American

678
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,080
 than a coiled wiener sitting atop

679
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,000
 a pile of fuzzy balls.

680
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,440
 - Enter Hay Scoops at checkout, patriots.

681
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,480
 - I also would like to endorse this product for the grave.

682
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,320
 - Thank you, Val.

683
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,880
 - Oh, Val Kilmer, Batman.

684
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,120
 - Yes, I wore very tight pants.

685
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,760
 I wish I'd had a hole for my ween ween

686
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,680
 'cause, boy, I had to hold my pee in a lot.

687
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,440
 On most days, many days I couldn't pee.

688
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,520
 What's your game, Killer Croc?

689
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,600
 - There've been some good drug ads lately.

690
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,800
 An acne medication that I saw the other day,

691
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,560
 it had a warning that it would just cause eye problems.

692
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,600
 Instinct eye problems.

693
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,440
 That's all it said was eye problems.

694
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,640
 - What is this? - And I thought that was--

695
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,400
 - Did I take this medicine?

696
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,040
 - It was probably a pall medicine.

697
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,080
 It caused eye problems.

698
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,480
 And I thought that was gonna be the worst one I saw.

699
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,040
 I saw one last night.

700
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
 I paused it and had to rewind to it.

701
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 It caused an increased risk of lower limb loss.

702
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,520
 (laughing)

703
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
 - Lower limb loss.

704
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,240
 - But it doesn't say legs.

705
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,080
 It just says lower limb.

706
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,320
 - And it doesn't say what the loss might be.

707
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
 'Cause the way it's phrased,

708
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,920
 it definitely looks like it's just gonna fall off.

709
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 - Wow, and what does the drug help?

710
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,600
 - This was a cholesterol medication.

711
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,800
 - All right, lucky you.

712
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,480
 - Well, I mean, I guess I want that low LDL enough.

713
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,160
 I'll give up a foot.

714
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,440
 I guess, this seems,

715
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,640
 if we're gonna advertise drugs in this country,

716
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,560
 the warnings at least have to make sense.

717
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,320
 - No, there's no, no, they don't.

718
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,640
 - And I know our European listeners are just confused

719
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,480
 about drug companies being able to advertise on TV.

720
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,120
 We are too.

721
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
 - It's insane times, man.

722
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,520
 It's insane.

723
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,040
 I was just seeing somebody talking

724
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,040
 about the whole Tylenol debacle, right?

725
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
 - What do you mean, debacle?

726
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,880
 We figured out what causes autism, that's Tylenol.

727
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,640
 - Well, this is a cause for celebration.

728
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,280
 - The thing that they mentioned,

729
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,000
 and I don't know, it seemed to make some sense to me

730
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,720
 that they were like,

731
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,480
 why wouldn't Tylenol have started a lawsuit by now

732
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,200
 if their sales had been impacted in any way?

733
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,040
 Apparently, nobody's listening to this bullshit.

734
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,600
 Everybody's just still piloting fucking Tylenol.

735
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
 Right, I mean, we're in the land of commerce here.

736
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,160
 That's all that matters is bottom line.

737
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,720
 So apparently it's not hitting them

738
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,440
 in the pocketbook enough to make them,

739
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
 'cause there is no more litigious society

740
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,240
 than the United States.

741
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,080
 - Right.

742
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,080
 - So I, you know, I can only, you know.

743
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,520
 - Not only has Tylenol stock not dropped,

744
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,800
 it is trading near its 52 week high.

745
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,840
 - There you go.

746
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
 So there it is.

747
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,160
 Okay. - Yeah.

748
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,760
 - It was a brief significant drop in September.

749
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,240
 But apparently it bounced right back like the next day.

750
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,600
 - Okay.

751
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,680
 Interesting. - There you go.

752
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,520
 - That is fascinating.

753
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,960
 That actually makes me feel good

754
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,720
 that it was that dumb that people were like, okay.

755
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,200
 - And it also kind of makes me feel good

756
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,720
 that they aren't suing.

757
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,040
 Like they're like, oh, we can't demonstrate damages.

758
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,280
 So I guess we'll just leave this one alone.

759
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
 - Yeah, that's so strange.

760
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,080
 - Oh, I never, Bassey, Bassey in the chat,

761
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,680
 just the thing that was created in the '50s

762
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,680
 is responsible for something that was discovered in 1911.

763
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,960
 - Yeah, exactly.

764
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,800
 Yeah.

765
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,880
 - I need to think about that aspect of it.

766
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,160
 That's a fine way to think about that.

767
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,240
 - There's not a whole lot of medical research

768
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,000
 going on here at all.

769
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,920
 - Well, I didn't believe it until now.

770
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,600
 I mean, it's not like Bassey's statement

771
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,360
 just caused me to shift my opinion on Tylenol.

772
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,640
 - Excuse me, excuse me, Jacob.

773
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,400
 You're talking, you're talking out of your neck.

774
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,040
 I gotta tell you, I'm pretty sure just looking at you,

775
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,840
 'cause I could just look at people and diagnose them.

776
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,720
 I'm pretty sure that you were circumcised way too early.

777
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,800
 That's what I think now.

778
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,280
 - Damn it.

779
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,120
 - Val Kilmer?

780
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,600
 - It's me, Val Kilmer, back from the dead.

781
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,120
 (Val laughing)

782
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,840
 - Quado from "Total Recall"?

783
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,400
 - Watch your game, Freeze.

784
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,200
 - He'd be an amazing, he is an amazing villain.

785
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,040
 What the fuck am I saying?

786
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,720
 He is a fucking Batman villain.

787
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,200
 - He is a Batman villain.

788
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,840
 - Jesus Christ, we're surrounded by Batman villains.

789
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,880
 - And not in the good way.

790
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,080
 - No, not, there's nothing fun about it.

791
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,680
 - None of them look like Uma Thurman dressed in plants.

792
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,120
 - Oh, Uma Thurman.

793
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
 - No, Uma Thurman.

794
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,160
 - Uma Thurman.

795
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,520
 - Sorry, everybody, I just got Paul started on jacking it.

796
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,240
 He just set him off, everybody, I'm sorry, that's my fault.

797
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,600
 I said Uma Thurman.

798
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,440
 - Come on.

799
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,240
 - I'll be back in five and just a nap on camera.

800
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,720
 - So we're getting the house repainted.

801
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,240
 It's been crazy out here.

802
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,000
 We're trying to juggle, making sure we get home in time

803
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,680
 to help them get the stuff they need or whatever,

804
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,120
 and, you know, but we're staying out of their way

805
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,040
 as best we can, but we gotta put the dogs outside sometimes,

806
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,280
 but then the dogs, the stuff's getting painted.

807
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,960
 So stuff got painted last night,

808
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,280
 right where the dogs were outside,

809
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,640
 so we had to lay down some cardboard,

810
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,040
 and then the dogs wouldn't go on the cardboard,

811
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,920
 so we had to carry the dogs all around.

812
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,840
 It was a sight, and had to go get some special new clothes,

813
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,560
 'cause she had a special interview come up last minute,

814
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,120
 last night, yesterday.

815
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,960
 So we were out--

816
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
 - I thought you meant the dogs were such a mess,

817
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
 she had to go get new clothes.

818
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,680
 Did you do like an '80s movie montage

819
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,160
 where you wait outside the dressing room,

820
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,720
 and she just kept coming on outfit after outfit,

821
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,680
 and you were like, "Yes, no, maybe."

822
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
 - That's how we do it.

823
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,680
 - That's the one.

824
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,680
 - Every time we go to Cole's, and I go first into Cole's,

825
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,400
 I have her wait in the car, and I go into Cole's first

826
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,440
 and grab a couple of scarves and sunglasses,

827
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
 and I basically transform into the character of Hollywood

828
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,840
 from "Mannequin" and "Mannequin 2."

829
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,480
 And so I take on this new persona,

830
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,120
 and when she comes through the door, I just say,

831
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,000
 "Oh my, let's find something for you that will just work."

832
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
 And then she starts trying things on,

833
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,800
 and then as she comes out as Hollywood,

834
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,760
 I will then comment and say,

835
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,820
 "Well, I guess the 1950s called back."

836
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,800
 Something to that effect.

837
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,400
 And then she'll come out again and be,

838
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,920
 "Oh, goodness, no one told me Ms. Greta Garbo

839
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,520
 was going to be in the building."

840
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,520
 Huzzah, things like that, things of this nature.

841
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
 - Huzzah.

842
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,800
 - Things of this nature.

843
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,840
 - I wonder what percentage of our audience was not alive

844
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,800
 when the movie "Mannequin" was released.

845
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
 (all laughing)

846
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,280
 - That makes me scared to think about.

847
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,240
 - 'Cause it's not zero, it's not zero percent.

848
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,720
 - Yeah, you're right, it's not zero.

849
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,240
 - That movie's older than a seat of medicine.

850
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,080
 - Someone in the chat says,

851
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,080
 "The seat of medicine was actually used back in 1893."

852
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,540
 I don't, I mean.

853
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,380
 - Whatever.

854
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,720
 - I think we can fact-check everything,

855
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,260
 including the link between Tylenol and autism.

856
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,100
 Is that fair?

857
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,280
 - Yeah, missing link.

858
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,120
 - Fair.

859
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,440
 - The missing link.

860
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,280
 - Yeah.

861
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,480
 - Nobody thinks that we know what we're talking about.

862
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,500
 - Uh-huh.

863
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,340
 - Yeah.

864
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,180
 I admit it.

865
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,280
 - Of course, apparently nobody thinks that RFK

866
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,200
 knows what he's talking about either,

867
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,020
 since that doesn't affect Tylenol's stock price.

868
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,720
 - That's for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

869
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,560
 I'm constantly doing this noise

870
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,560
 while I'm going down on Cheryl Hyde's, so she's just.

871
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,640
 (laughing)

872
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,940
 Her pussy is just full of this voice.

873
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,200
 (laughing)

874
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:30,200
 It's hard enough, most men, to find the clitoris.

875
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,480
 Her clitoris runs away from my voice.

876
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,320
 (laughing)

877
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,480
 - All right, Andy Cheek points out

878
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,360
 that we have done more research than the government

879
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,200
 on the link between Tylenol and autism just here.

880
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,920
 I believe that's true.

881
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
 I believe that is true.

882
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,920
 - Agreed to disagree.

883
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,120
 (laughing)

884
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
 - Oh no, he got us.

885
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,920
 - What's your game, calendar man?

886
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,200
 - Drove through Taco Bell the other night after work,

887
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,720
 and the guy on the speaker goes,

888
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,320
 yeah, it's like 1 a.m. or so,

889
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,440
 and the guy on the speaker goes, hey, how's your night going?

890
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,120
 Yeah, it's doing all right, how you doing?

891
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,240
 Shitty, man.

892
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,080
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

893
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,960
 - Thanks for asking.

894
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,240
 - So I put my order in, I pulled up to the window,

895
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,200
 and this dude just leans out of the window.

896
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,640
 He goes, man, I've been having a night.

897
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,880
 (laughing)

898
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,160
 He proceeds to tell me, just all the jerks

899
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
 that have pulled up to the Taco Bell drive

900
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,680
 through that night.

901
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,400
 And he just needed to vent.

902
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,600
 - That's amazing that you were there for him.

903
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,440
 - I was like, what you got, buddy?

904
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,080
 I'm here for you, man.

905
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,920
 - I was just talking--

906
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,320
 - We just sat and chatted in the drive through

907
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,400
 for about five minutes, too.

908
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,480
 We had a nice little chat.

909
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
 He's a good guy.

910
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,000
 - We were just talking Taco Bell at work the other day,

911
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,600
 and some of my younger coworkers,

912
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,720
 I was like, guys, I don't know if you know,

913
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,720
 but back in the day, if you spent $20 at the Taco Bell,

914
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,520
 you had ordered the entire menu.

915
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,360
 - Oh yeah.

916
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,560
 (laughing)

917
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,400
 - Yeah.

918
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,000
 (laughing)

919
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,840
 - But now--

920
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,760
 - But you can get the big case of tacos.

921
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,440
 - Yeah, you can get a box for like $3.

922
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,960
 - For like 15 bucks, yeah.

923
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,840
 15 bucks for like 16 tacos.

924
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,400
 It was crazy.

925
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,000
 Yeah, and now it's just, it's a hard time.

926
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,520
 ♪ Get ready for some Middle East ♪

927
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,880
 ♪ What I got on ♪

928
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,520
 - Things used to be cheaper.

929
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,160
 - Brought to you by Taladol.

930
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,280
 - Yeah, yeah, we're raising the prices of tacos.

931
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,720
 Don't say taco around the Mr. President.

932
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,520
 He doesn't like that.

933
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,400
 - Paul Brogan in the chat already mentioned

934
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,920
 that they were not alive when "Mannequin" came out.

935
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
 - Well--

936
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,920
 - So there's one already.

937
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,520
 - Brogan, I hope you have at least seen "Mannequin"

938
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,880
 and "Mannequin 2."

939
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,120
 - No, Brogan is shaking their head in the chat.

940
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,760
 - Well, Brogan, you've got homework.

941
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,240
 'Cause Hollywood is I fucking conic.

942
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,080
 Yes.

943
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,200
 - Brogan, you don't have any homework.

944
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
 You don't have to watch "Mannequin."

945
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,120
 Matt Mattingly's Ice Cream Social

946
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,920
 does not want to encourage people

947
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,600
 to watch the film "Mannequin."

948
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
 - I mean-- - Oh, I do.

949
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,360
 - Peak Andrew McCarthy, you know?

950
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 - Peak Andrew McCarthy.

951
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,200
 - That is true.

952
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,400
 Peak Andrew McCarthy for sure.

953
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,000
 - It's, what's her name?

954
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,120
 It's, oh my God.

955
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,960
 - Kim Cattrall.

956
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,000
 - Kim Cattrall at the height of her powers.

957
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,440
 My God.

958
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,240
 She's unstoppable.

959
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,600
 I mean, if you wanted a little peek

960
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,040
 into what formed old Paul,

961
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,600
 baby Paul's idea of--

962
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,640
 - 'Cause it was so mysterious up until this point.

963
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
 (laughing)

964
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,640
 - Who would have thought that Paul's ideal woman

965
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,360
 would be a beautiful Kim Cattrall

966
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,640
 that could then turn into a life-size action figure?

967
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,360
 (laughing)

968
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,960
 Who would have ever imagined?

969
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,200
 (laughing)

970
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,120
 - I'll tell you who else wanted to fuck a mannequin

971
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,360
 when they were a kid, and still kind of do,

972
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,600
 and that's the following sponsor.

973
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,640
 - That's the whole thing about "Mannequin."

974
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,720
 He sets up these beautiful, elaborate sets in the windows

975
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,320
 and becomes famous for his beautiful sets.

976
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,720
 I just wanted to see one where the mannequin is dripping goo.

977
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,960
 (laughing)

978
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,520
 - Did they use this mannequin and shoot a "Ghostbusters?"

979
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,000
 It's covered in slime.

980
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
 (laughing)

981
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,400
 Following sponsor.

982
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,920
 - Why does this Macy's display say,

983
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,680
 "Mine if I use your shower?"

984
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,920
 (laughing)

985
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,600
 - Today's show is brought to you by--

 (laughing)

988
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,600
 - Please do not touch the mannequin goo.

989
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,200
 (laughing)

990
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
 - Seriously, no wash? - It's in the open stores.

991
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,080
 - Seriously, no washcloths?

992
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,480
 Today's show is brought to you by

993
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,800
 Feral Child's wedding video voiceover service.

994
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,960
 That's right, if you need a wedding video voiceover,

995
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,920
 you can get it done by Feral Child.

996
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,080
 That's from Nola Scoop in 2021.

997
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,680
 - What was like when proposed to stay together for life?

998
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,240
 Well, now can remember with Feral Child's voice.

999
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,680
 Remember, mom and dad walk down aisle?

1000
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,680
 Remember dog carry ring?

1001
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,680
 Oh, remember little boy pee on altar?

1002
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
 Accidents happen?

1003
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,560
 Remember bridesmaid get caught on fire

1004
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,160
 from standing next to candelabra?

1005
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,960
 Remember bridesmaid require eight years plastic surgery

1006
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,680
 to regain facial recognition?

1007
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,760
 Remember bridesmaids still not right in head

1008
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,080
 about terrible burning?

1009
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,120
 - Oh, I gotta fast forward through this part.

1010
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,960
 - Bridesmaid.

1011
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,360
 (laughing)

1012
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,760
 - I'm gonna fast forward.

1013
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,080
 - All right, let's see what this is.

1014
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,440
 - And bridesmaids say vengeance will be hers.

1015
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,120
 - Oh man, we got a lot of bridesmaids.

1016
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,960
 I'm gonna fast forward a little more.

1017
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,120
 - Hotel rooms from state to state.

1018
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,380
 (mumbling)

1019
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,520
 - Okay, here we go.

1020
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,400
 - She's still alive.

1021
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,200
 Most of head look hamburger, but she not gone.

1022
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,640
 - Enter eight scoops and check out.

1023
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,560
 - Short surgery, not successful.

1024
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,200
 (laughing)

1025
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,600
 - That bridesmaid ruined my wedding video.

1026
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
 (laughing)

1027
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,720
 - I mean, it's an event to remember.

1028
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,560
 - It is.

1029
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,280
 - You'll never forget that time the bridesmaid caught on fire.

1030
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,640
 - No, you won't.

1031
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,480
 You won't.

1032
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,960
 - Oh man.

1033
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,960
 I watched hacks, season four of hacks on the plane.

1034
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,240
 - Okay.

1035
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,080
 - On the plane here.

1036
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,920
 - I fell off of hacks.

1037
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,880
 I liked the first two seasons a lot.

1038
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,240
 And then I fell off somewhere at season three.

1039
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,840
 And then I picked up a season four,

1040
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,560
 obviously missing some of the information

1041
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,280
 from the end of season three.

1042
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,120
 I feel like I gathered all that information pretty quickly.

1043
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,160
 (laughing)

1044
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,400
 And then I just watched three episodes

1045
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
 of them being horrible to each other

1046
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,480
 and them being horrible people.

1047
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,460
 And I was like, where are the jokes?

1048
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,160
 What am I supposed to be watching?

1049
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,400
 - Because the first two seasons of it were like,

1050
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,160
 they were too close to home for us.

1051
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,400
 - Oh, sure.

1052
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,720
 - It was too much Las Vegas showbiz.

1053
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,160
 It was too accurate.

1054
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,320
 - Yes.

1055
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,000
 - And yeah, now it's, oh, well, this is just,

1056
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,960
 okay, I get it now.

1057
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,800
 All right.

1058
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,760
 - Yeah.

1059
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
 - Broken people being mean.

1060
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,600
 - Yeah.

1061
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,920
 - And they changed what the show is.

1062
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,000
 They changed it from, she's like the older person

1063
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,040
 who's trying to revitalize her career

1064
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,200
 and now she's just rich and powerful.

1065
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,040
 - Yeah.

1066
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,000
 - And I was like, who am I supposed to be rooting for

1067
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,920
 and where and why?

1068
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,720
 What am I supposed to, who do I want to do things?

1069
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,560
 - Right.

1070
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,600
 - And I just was like, oh man,

1071
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,480
 it put me in such a bad mood.

1072
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,040
 I was really in like a sour mood getting off my plane.

1073
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,440
 And I literally was like, why am I in a bad mood?

1074
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,600
 I was like, today's nothing.

1075
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,440
 I'm just traveling.

1076
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,120
 All I'm doing is traveling

1077
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,200
 and get to get to get to my friend's house

1078
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,840
 to go grab dinner and watch football.

1079
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
 Why, how am I in a bad mood?

1080
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,480
 And I was like, I think hacks put me in a bad mood.

1081
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,240
 (laughing)

1082
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,760
 - Thanks a lot, Elizabeth Smart.

1083
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,000
 - Well, there's your hacks hacks.

1084
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,960
 Don't watch it.

1085
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,200
 - And I know people who write on it.

1086
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,040
 I know people who film it and stuff,

1087
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,880
 and I pulled their names out on my phone

1088
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,920
 and showed them to my friend.

1089
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,480
 (laughing)

1090
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,680
 - Gene Smart, thank you.

1091
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,600
 - Who was it designing women with me, Shaq Taylor,

1092
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,600
 who played Hollywood, iconic mannequin character.

1093
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,760
 (laughing)

1094
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,440
 Seven degrees to Hollywood.

1095
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,320
 - You know it all goes back to mannequin.

1096
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,160
 You know it.

1097
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,600
 - It all goes back to mannequin.

1098
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,560
 - Paul, Paul, Elizabeth Taylor.

1099
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,360
 - Okay, Elizabeth Taylor, married briefly to Michael Jackson.

1100
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,240
 Michael Jackson, married briefly to Priscilla Presley.

1101
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,680
 Priscilla Presley, married briefly to a mannequin

1102
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,560
 named Michael Jackson.

1103
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,800
 Michael Jackson was a mannequin.

1104
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,640
 Hollywood.

1105
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,320
 - I say only four degrees.

1106
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,520
 - Four degrees. - Only four degrees.

1107
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,360
 - Four degrees.

1108
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,040
 - Elizabeth Smart was a girl who was kidnapped, right?

1109
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,880
 - Elizabeth Smart is the poor one that got kidnapped.

1110
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,240
 - I would rather watch that

1111
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
 than the rest of the hack season.

1112
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,480
 (laughing)

1113
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,760
 - You'd rather watch Elizabeth Smart be kidnapped.

1114
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,080
 - I'd rather just watch it.

1115
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,160
 - Apologies to Elizabeth Smart.

1116
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,080
 - Oh yes, and Andy Cheek is pointing out I got it wrong.

1117
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,320
 It wasn't Priscilla Presley.

1118
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,800
 It was Lisa Marie that he married.

1119
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,520
 - I mean, I don't know that he didn't marry Priscilla.

1120
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,480
 I'm not a Michael Jackson historian.

1121
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,800
 - Exactly.

1122
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,400
 She went from one King of Pop to the next.

1123
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,440
 - I am watching "Task."

1124
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,640
 - You're still doing it.

1125
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,480
 - Okay, yes.

1126
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,320
 It's so depressing.

1127
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,400
 - You're putting Matt in a bad mood.

1128
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,240
 - But I'm just in.

1129
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,080
 It does make me so sad.

1130
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,920
 But I'm at least prepared.

1131
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,840
 I know, but I'm going to bed then.

1132
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,680
 - You're ready though.

1133
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,520
 You're ready for that.

1134
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,360
 - I'm gonna go to bed sad.

1135
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,160
 - I did that for my whole childhood.

1136
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,000
 - No, so.

1137
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 But the thing about it, this is so Mark Ruffalo,

1138
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,080
 he grows his hair out, you know,

1139
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,800
 he's got like kind of like bushy hair.

1140
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,800
 And then he gets like a head injury at one point,

1141
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,960
 and he also gets beat up.

1142
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,680
 So his back is all jacked up.

1143
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,240
 So at one point he walks in, it's like a dead serious scene.

1144
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,880
 It's like a pivotal scene in the series.

1145
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,520
 And he is walking and talking like Columbo.

1146
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,360
 Like he is just being Columbo.

1147
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,560
 - It's full on now at this point.

1148
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,960
 - It just looks like Columbo.

1149
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,840
 And he's literally doing the like, yeah, just one more thing.

1150
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,320
 And like, he's bringing up things that he knows

1151
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,400
 that he figured out.

1152
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,680
 And he's trying to make a guy basically cave.

1153
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,600
 - He is Peter Falk in it.

1154
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,440
 - And I'm so distracted.

1155
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,840
 Cause I'm like, this is like four o'clock in the morning

1156
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,680
 on my cruise ship.

1157
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,360
 And I'm like, this is just Columbo.

1158
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,960
 I'm just watching this thing from Columbo.

1159
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,000
 (laughing)

1160
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,880
 - This guy could have found Elizabeth Smart.

1161
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,480
 - Six episode windup of watching the most depressed hunk

1162
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,440
 of like American life.

1163
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,920
 And I am just totally distracted

1164
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,320
 by this Columbo impersonation.

1165
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,920
 I'm watching that happen on this thing.

1166
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,240
 It looked right out of Columbo.

1167
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,080
 - Wow.

1168
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,640
 (laughing)

1169
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,080
 - Mark Ruffa Columbo.

1170
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,920
 - Yeah.

1171
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,360
 (laughing)

1172
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,560
 - Well, my other excitement and all the fracas

1174
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,800
 that went on last night

1175
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
 and getting everything squared away

1176
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,080
 and getting the dogs where they need to be

1177
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,360
 and cause we're wrestling around.

1178
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,120
 I'm wearing my, this new hoodie that Mizzoula got for me

1179
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,960
 which I love.

1180
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,120
 It's this really cool Star Wars hoodie that he got for me.

1181
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,120
 And I put some doggy treats in the pocket to

1182
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,520
 cause I was, you know, wrangling dogs.

1183
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,760
 I'm doing laundry today and I put it in my second load

1184
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,840
 and I go to clear out my second load

1185
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,600
 and I had left the doggy treats in the pocket.

1186
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
 (laughing)

1187
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,880
 And I'm like, fuck me.

1188
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,600
 - Cleanest doggy treats in Pittsburgh.

1189
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,160
 - I'm so mad.

1190
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,960
 And it's just, luckily it was the gunk of it.

1191
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,920
 The treats were all just in the pocket and the sweater.

1192
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,760
 - It didn't break out.

1193
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,600
 - Oh, that's good.

1194
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,560
 - No, you didn't get the rest of the laundry exactly.

1195
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,920
 But I had to clean, clean, clean the sweater out

1196
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,560
 and it's still not coming clean exactly.

1197
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,800
 It's in the dryer now.

1198
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,240
 But I took the rest of that load that looked fairly okay.

1199
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,600
 You know, didn't have like stuff in it,

1200
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,800
 but it had been washed.

1201
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,000
 - I've always said that about your loads.

1202
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,520
 Your loads usually look fairly okay.

1203
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
 - They look fairly okay, but well,

1204
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,280
 they look best when dripping out of mannequins.

1205
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,120
 - Sure, sure.

1206
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,520
 (laughing)

1207
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,520
 - But I--

1208
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,160
 - Use the eye wash station.

1209
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,360
 - Please, save yourselves.

1210
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,560
 But I threw everything in the dryer

1211
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,160
 and then I go to take the stuff out of the dryer

1212
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,000
 and I'm taking it out and I, you know,

1213
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,160
 'cause I use the like the little, the scent booster stuff,

1214
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,040
 the, anyway, the downy scent, whatever it is.

1215
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,880
 - Yeah.

1216
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,560
 - Anyway, I give a little sniff

1217
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,360
 and it's got just this sort of very faint,

1218
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,080
 but they're sort of beefiness to it.

1219
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,600
 And it was like, fuck,

1220
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,040
 I have to wash all these clothes again.

1221
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,240
 (laughing)

1222
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,200
 Why did you have to wash?

1223
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,080
 But they already had the scent of beef.

1224
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,760
 Why did you wash them again, Paul?

1225
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,560
 - I'm trying to rid myself of the scent of beef.

1226
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,160
 I'm trying, I'm trying to un-beef my laundry.

1227
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,760
 - You have beef experience.

1228
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,080
 - I do, brother, do I?

1229
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,920
 So this is--

1230
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,760
 - I'm looking for that right now.

1231
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,480
 - This is my afternoon is--

1232
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,080
 - I know what beef is.

1233
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,400
 I have had beef experience.

1234
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,360
 I know beef.

1235
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,960
 - It's true.

1236
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,440
 And brother?

1237
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,880
 - Hoo, know it, I wear it.

1238
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,560
 (laughing)

1239
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,480
 - Exactly.

1240
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,320
 So, yeah, that's my excitement for the day,

1241
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,760
 is cleaning my new favorite shirt

1242
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,720
 and finding I sabotaged my new favorite shirt

1243
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,360
 with a bunch of fucking dog treats.

1244
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,360
 - With beef scent.

1245
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,280
 - With beef scent.

1246
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,120
 So hopefully--

1247
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,760
 - Some say sabotage, some say improve.

1248
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,000
 - Hopefully it's fixed.

1249
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,440
 We'll see.

1250
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,160
 It dried finally.

1251
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,560
 We'll see what's going on.

1252
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,160
 Good Lord, I don't know.

1253
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,720
 - I want all of Paul's wardrobe to just smell like beef.

1254
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,800
 - Well, give it a couple days, it might.

1255
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,600
 We'll see.

1256
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,400
 I need to put some more perfume on it, maybe.

1257
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,240
 - Yeah, that's probably what it's missing.

1258
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,600
 You wanna do a little Scoop Mail?

1259
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,440
 - Let's do Scoop Scoop Scoop.

1260
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
 - I ache for it.

1261
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,200
 - Message for you, sir.

1262
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,640
 - We got one here from Poutine Scoops.

1263
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,120
 Hello fuckers.

1264
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,520
 Here's an Italian air show story from my childhood.

1265
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,920
 Back in 1995, there was a referendum in Quebec

1266
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,560
 to separate from Canada.

1267
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,160
 As dumb as 13-year-old me and my friend thought,

1268
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,640
 we're gonna need our own money as a country.

1269
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,920
 We proceeded to heat up a Canadian penny with a lighter

1270
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,360
 to engrave it with a fleur de lis or something.

1271
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,560
 The lighter didn't soften the penny enough,

1272
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,120
 so we went outside and grabbed the red gas can

1273
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,040
 for the lawnmower.

1274
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,160
 Oh, gas can, gotta be gas.

1275
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
 Grabbed the red gas can for the lawnmower

1276
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,560
 and tried to soften the penny some more.

1277
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,560
 Spoiler, you can't melt a penny with gas as a 13-year-old.

1278
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,680
 - What?

1279
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,880
 - Jet fuel doesn't melt steel pennies.

1280
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,240
 - No, I guess not.

1281
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,320
 We put too much gas on, and at some point,

1282
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,320
 my genius self tries to put the fire out by stomping it down

1283
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,160
 with the first thing I got on my hand,

1284
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,920
 which was the red gas can.

1285
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,280
 What?

1286
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,880
 So you had a fire that you were trying to melt a penny

1287
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,520
 in the fire, pouring gasoline on it,

1288
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,880
 and then you had the gas can in your hand,

1289
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,880
 and so you tried to use the gas can

1290
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,360
 to then tamp out the fire?

1291
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,040
 - To tamp out the flame, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,520
 - Oh, no.

1293
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,440
 - Oh, yeah.

1294
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,240
 - We now have a significant red gas can fire on our hands.

1295
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,480
 My friend runs to grab the water hose,

1296
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,400
 but the full red gas can on fire won't stop burning

1297
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,320
 because it's a gas can.

1298
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,720
 - Quick, get more gas.

1299
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,720
 We gotta put up this gas fire.

1300
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,080
 - Throw some rice on that.

1301
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,720
 - Oh, that would have fixed it.

1302
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,600
 Now, do you guys remember the red gas cans

1303
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,160
 exploding in '80s movies?

1304
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,920
 Because I did, it's gonna explode and destroy the house.

1305
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,520
 I'd better kick it further away from the house.

1306
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,760
 - Oh, no.

1307
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,280
 - So the bottom of the red gas can

1308
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,880
 had already melted on the grass,

1309
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,200
 so only the top of the can got kicked away

1310
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,200
 and the not yet burned gas went everywhere.

1311
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,480
 So as a 13-year-old on fire guy, I proceeded to...

1312
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,880
 I don't know what that's supposed to say.

1313
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,200
 This is an oddly written letter.

1314
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,840
 I think this person might still be on fire

1315
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,680
 when they wrote this letter.

1316
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,320
 - This is a traumatic event, clearly, for this individual.

1317
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,280
 - Yeah.

1318
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,840
 - I am watching it burn right now.

1319
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,880
 I type as I...

1320
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,280
 I type as I...

1321
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,120
 - I'm doing Voice the Text!

1322
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,720
 - Scope is reliving this, yeah.

1323
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,840
 - Went all the way around the house to the back

1324
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,840
 to get my water hose friend who then extinguished my legs.

1325
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,000
 - Oh, my God.

1326
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,320
 - Your legs caught fire?

1327
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,720
 - Yeah.

1328
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,720
 This reminds me of a wedding video I just saw.

1329
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,880
 - Of the girl with the flame...

1330
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,000
 The girl with the flame on the chain

1331
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,640
 and she tosses it all over the place?

1332
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,800
 - Oh, I haven't seen that.

1333
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,800
 - Oh, okay.

1334
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,840
 - Did it really happen?

1335
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,920
 She burned up people?

1336
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,640
 - Yeah, yeah, she like tossed up basically a flame ball

1337
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,320
 into the crowd of people at a wedding.

1338
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,520
 - Did they all freak out when it happened?

1339
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,240
 - Yes, yeah, yeah.

1340
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,080
 - Did anybody die?

1341
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,280
 - Three months in the hospital, skin grafts,

1342
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,760
 all the things. - Oh, shit!

1343
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,240
 - My legs still look weird,

1344
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,080
 but they work great.

1345
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,920
 - Dear God.

1346
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,040
 - Worst thing about it is my scars won't sweat

1347
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,840
 and it's a good part of my legs,

1348
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,440
 so the end of the scars sweat like crazy

1349
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,480
 because it's all going out wherever it can.

1350
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,320
 - Oh!

1351
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,760
 - It gets a little itchy, but no big deal.

1352
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,000
 - What a strange set of facts. - I'm so sorry, Poutine Scoop.

1353
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,840
 Oh, that's so awful.

1354
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,280
 - Oh, the referendum went 50.2 to 49.8,

1355
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,040
 so no, I'm still Canadian

1356
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,240
 and we still don't have our own pennies.

1357
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,400
 That's Poutine Scoop.

1358
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,720
 - You know, I don't think Canada even has pennies now.

1359
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,000
 - So it's all for naught.

1360
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,720
 - Well, I don't think they even have pennies now,

1361
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,560
 just like us.

1362
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,640
 I think they also got rid of their pennies.

1363
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,120
 I see Crystal Twist is saying I'm right.

1364
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,880
 They don't have pennies anymore.

1365
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,720
 - Oh!

1366
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,680
 - So not only was it for naught,

1367
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,000
 but it wouldn't have even worked before.

1368
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,360
 - Huh.

1369
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,120
 Well, technically, the US has never had pennies.

1370
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,640
 We have one cent pieces.

1371
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,120
 The English and the Canadians have pennies.

1372
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,360
 There's no US-- - Poutine Scoop.

1373
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
 That is such a heartbreaker.

1374
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,680
 As a former young adolescent boy who played with fire,

1375
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,800
 I can only say that I, there but for the grace of fate,

1376
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,680
 do I not join you in insanity.

1377
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,480
 I remember one day we were at a friend's house

1378
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,480
 and he put gasoline in one of those little

1379
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,320
 plastic dinosaurs that are about six inches tall, right?

1380
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,360
 Do you remember those old hard plastic dinosaurs?

1381
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1382
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,440
 And they were hollow in the middle.

1383
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,280
 - Exactly.

1384
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
 So he filled it up with gasoline

1385
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,960
 and he set the mouth on fire

1386
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,360
 thinking it was gonna look like breathing fire.

1387
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,800
 - I'm with this kid.

1388
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,840
 This is a smart kid.

1389
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,960
 - It didn't really do much.

1390
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,240
 It just started melting the face.

1391
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,240
 But then he went and tipped the tail

1392
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,360
 and the gasoline barfed out of the thing

1393
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,280
 and it filled this basement with fire.

1394
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,200
 And lucky there was nothing on the floor.

1395
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,680
 - You were inside doing this.

1396
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,440
 - Yeah, it was inside a basement.

1397
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,000
 It's a concrete floor.

1398
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,760
 And luckily nobody got hurt and it got out.

1399
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,080
 But it was scary.

1400
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,240
 - It didn't burn the house down.

1401
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,400
 - It was scary for a minute.

1402
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1403
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,800
 - It's actually pretty scary here

1404
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,880
 at the core sensors building.

1405
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,480
 Zach broke the light.

1406
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,880
 So there's a light broken.

1407
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,720
 Zach broke the light and now

1408
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,360
 we'll never find our way out of here.

1409
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,200
 I live here now.

1410
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,640
 - Well, at least you've got some sensors and gauges.

1411
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,480
 - That's right.

1412
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,680
 - I'm wondering how much pressure

1413
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,720
 I'm under to finish this episode.

1414
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,440
 I can actually figure out that number right now.

1415
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,360
 - But I appreciate Poutine sharing that trauma with us

1416
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,200
 for our entertainment.

1417
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,440
 - We definitely went through like a fire period

1418
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,640
 when we were kids.

1419
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,160
 - Yeah, every little boy does.

1420
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,520
 - Everything we would hear about.

1421
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,360
 Yeah, but like everything.

1422
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,800
 There was this period of time in the '80s and '90s

1423
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,120
 where you'd hear about these things

1424
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,480
 and people would tell them as cautionary tales.

1425
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,280
 Like make sure you don't mix, what was it?

1426
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,280
 Ivory soap and gasoline on an electric stove top

1427
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,800
 because that's how you can make napalm.

1428
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,640
 - Yes.

1429
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,120
 - And would be told that, it would be like,

1430
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,560
 well, clearly that's what we're gonna do now.

1431
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,720
 - I'd say it's time to make some napalm.

1432
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,200
 - Yeah, and we would do that.

1433
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,480
 We had like a hot plate out somewhere.

1434
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,160
 Like somebody had gotten a hot plate

1435
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,440
 and I remember we were in a culvert one time

1436
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,800
 in some neighborhood.

1437
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,080
 - A hot plate in a culvert?

1438
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,960
 - Yeah, it was crazy shit.

1439
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,280
 We read one time that if you cut off

1440
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,880
 a whole bunch of Strike Anywhere match heads

1441
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,760
 and shoved them into a tennis ball

1442
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,800
 that it would act like a hand grenade.

1443
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,000
 - Right.

1444
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,920
 - Which it shockingly almost worked exactly like that.

1445
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,560
 It was, you talk about like pouring gas

1446
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,920
 on the floor of the basement.

1447
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,640
 The hand grenade tennis ball was my pouring gas

1448
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,600
 on the floor of the basement.

1449
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,440
 - Where'd you throw it?

1450
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,200
 - We were outside and I don't think I threw it.

1451
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,880
 I think one of the other guys threw it

1452
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,960
 and just up against a brick wall.

1453
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,960
 - Oh shit.

1454
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,280
 - And like it just went.

1455
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,280
 It exploded and little nubs of fire,

1456
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,400
 just thousands of little nubs of fire

1457
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,600
 just went in every direction.

1458
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,440
 - Wow shit.

1459
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,800
 - And it definitely started a couple of fires.

1460
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,640
 It was terrifying.

1461
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,040
 - Oh God.

1462
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,880
 - Yeah.

1463
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,200
 - We used to ride our bikes up to the recycling center,

1464
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,640
 steal newspaper out of the recycling center newspaper

1465
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,520
 and then we took matches from a bucket of matches at 7-Eleven

1466
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,960
 and then we would go light newspaper on fire.

1467
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,560
 - It's its own fault for being so flammable.

1468
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,280
 - That'll teach it.

1469
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,120
 That'll learn it.

1470
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,960
 - We got one here from Anonymous Scoop X.

1471
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,080
 This recently happened and understandably

1472
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,240
 I can't possibly tell anyone in my life,

1473
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,120
 but this is where you three boys

1474
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,120
 and your confession booth of frozen dairy delights comes in.

1475
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,960
 - Yay.

1476
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,800
 - Here we are.

1477
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,560
 Now we're actually serving our purpose.

1478
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,280
 - This gentleman falls within the first blow job topic.

1479
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,400
 - Oh.

1480
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,240
 - Been a minute.

1481
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,080
 - Falls in?

1482
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,160
 Sounds like there's some qualifiers here.

1483
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,400
 - It sounds like there might be.

1484
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,360
 I've been dating my almost 40 year old partner

1485
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,840
 as a 34 year old woman.

1486
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,960
 I can't bring myself to say boyfriend

1487
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,840
 for the last few years.

1488
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,080
 We were flirtatious friends for many years,

1489
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,320
 which escalated to friends with benefits

1490
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,520
 and finally to long distance partners.

1491
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,720
 We'd meet up every month or so in person,

1492
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,120
 go on dates, play games, and perhaps most crucially,

1493
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,960
 fuck for hours.

1494
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,080
 It's been a journey of exploration for both of us.

1495
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,400
 We both have what is probably an unreasonably high sex drive

1496
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,440
 and we both enjoyed exploring new kinks and experiences.

1497
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,400
 I take particular pride in bringing any dream

1498
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,000
 or fantasy to life for the chap.

1499
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,560
 As a former cosplayer, I've also had a lot of fun

1500
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,400
 sewing costumes, making outfits,

1501
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,680
 and embroidering and embodying new characters.

1502
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,520
 - Amazing.

1503
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,240
 - As much as I've wanted to play out some of these things,

1504
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,840
 it's the first time I've met someone

1505
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,760
 who was as adventurous as I was,

1506
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,040
 who I was comfortable with.

1507
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,840
 - Jacob, this is clearly AI

1508
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
 or some weird old penthouse forum thing

1509
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,240
 where someone's just pretending to be awesome.

1510
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,040
 - I never thought it would happen to me.

1511
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,480
 This is not, this can't be true.

1512
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,320
 This can't be true.

1513
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,400
 - This is real life, David.

1514
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,760
 - Matt, Matt, all of those penthouse forum letters

1515
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,560
 had to come from real people.

1516
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,120
 So I mean, clearly those things really happened.

1517
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,960
 - All right.

1518
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,960
 - Oh, this is important context for what came next.

1519
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,160
 It was always a running joke in our friendship group

1520
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,560
 that my fellow was two scoops of plain old vanilla.

1521
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,080
 As an alternative lass covered in tattoos

1522
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,840
 and arresting bitch face to rival the best in the business,

1523
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,760
 we managed to go completely under the radar

1524
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,800
 for a long time, but behind closed doors,

1525
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,640
 he was very different.

1526
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,520
 We dabbled in toys, different positions, role plays.

1527
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,320
 We would laugh about how if they knew, they'd be shocked.

1528
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,200
 Cut to a few weeks ago, years down the line,

1529
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,720
 two days in a row, I'd woken the chap up

1530
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,360
 with a good morning blow job.

1531
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,320
 He recovers quickly, so both mornings,

1532
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,880
 he'd managed to come twice in a row before work.

1533
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,120
 - Holy smoke. - What can I say?

1534
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,840
 I'm dedicated to the craft.

1535
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,880
 - That's an incredible refractory period.

1536
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,520
 - That is.

1537
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,360
 - Anyway, after day two-- - This man should be

1538
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,120
 studied by R.F.K. Jr.

1539
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,400
 - I don't know how you do that.

1540
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,200
 - Anyway, after day two, we were talking away

1541
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,360
 and it got into the topic of porn.

1542
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,120
 He let me in on the fact that he watches role play porn.

1543
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,640
 The boy watches it for the plot.

1544
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,960
 I was in absolute hysterics.

1545
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,840
 I couldn't believe it.

1546
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,800
 I didn't know these people still existed.

1547
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,720
 He's really rooting for that pizza delivery boy.

1548
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,760
 He asked what porn I watched and I had to explain

1549
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,640
 that I didn't think he would know

1550
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,440
 what all the letters stood for in my search term.

1551
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,520
 I'd simply said, if there are less than four people

1552
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,920
 in the room, I'm probably not interested.

1553
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,520
 He was also surprised when I said

1554
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,080
 that I can't stand the introduction,

1555
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,680
 so I just passed forward to the good bits.

1556
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,560
 - So L-E-M-O-N, those are the types of things

1557
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,800
 that you put in there?

1558
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,640
 - That's right, that's right.

1559
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,520
 - Lemon party. - P-A-R-T-Y.

1560
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,640
 Because I like it.

1561
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,200
 That's when the situation escalated

1562
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,160
 and it hit me like a bus to the face.

1563
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,920
 Well, I'm quite vanilla.

1564
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,800
 You know that, or I was before we met.

1565
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,360
 Before you, I'd only had one blowjob,

1566
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,000
 he mumbled, somewhat embarrassed.

1567
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,440
 Then in an even quieter voice,

1568
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,600
 he said, well, sort of half of one.

1569
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,440
 He explained, one girlfriend once had tried it

1570
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,040
 and decided it wasn't really for her.

1571
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,280
 (laughing)

1572
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,200
 Had been married since,

1573
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,880
 and she was absolutely not forgiving it a go.

1574
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,960
 Boys, I'm ashamed to say I laughed my fucking ass off

1575
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,760
 for a long time.

1576
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,160
 Throughout the day, periodically,

1577
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,040
 I laughed repeatedly, and not a chuckle.

1578
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,200
 I laughed at the volume of a demented, drug-addled clown.

1579
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,080
 I couldn't believe that he was telling me

1580
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,120
 this many years down the line

1581
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:59,360
 what must be literally hundreds of blowjobs later.

1582
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,600
 He'd had four blowjobs in the space of 24 hours

1583
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,160
 compared to the half a job he'd had

1584
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,560
 in the previous 38 years of life.

1585
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,520
 It's important to say I wasn't laughing at him.

1586
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,480
 I was just laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation.

1587
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,200
 Although apparently clarifying that

1588
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,200
 did not make up for how hard I was laughing at the time.

1589
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,320
 So that's my story of how my partner's dreams came true

1590
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,760
 when he realized he'd met a human vacuum cleaner

1591
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,080
 who'd happily putter around in a homemade poison ivy outfit.

1592
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,560
 Ooh, poison ivy outfit, full circle.

1593
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,280
 If it meant he'd be happy,

1594
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,360
 although not quite a first blowjob story,

1595
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,080
 you'd have to have a very specific category

1596
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,160
 for the first blowjob story for that one.

1597
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,000
 Thanks for giving me an outlet for this tale.

1598
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 The podcast brings me absolute joy.

1599
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,080
 That's Anonymous Scoop X.

1600
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,520
 Thank you, Anonymous Scoop.

1601
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,960
 And like most people that like our podcast,

1602
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,520
 Anonymous Scoop insists on remaining anonymous.

1603
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,560
 (laughing)

1604
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,520
 People don't want to like our podcast openly.

1605
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,720
 I get it, I get it.

1606
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,760
 Hey, the fade button works.

1607
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,920
 - Nice.

1608
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,200
 - That's a nice change.

1609
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,600
 It's time for "Jock vs. Nerd".

1610
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,760
 (howling)

1611
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,600
 - It's on.

1612
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,040
 - You wanna do a little "Jock vs. Nerd" action?

1613
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:16,880
 - Oh, am I?

1614
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,280
 - Fuck yeah.

1615
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,480
 - I'm on the hunt for balls.

1616
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,060
 (upbeat music)

1617
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:28,920
 - I'm on the hunt for balls.

1618
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,760
 - No!

1619
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,000
 We got a scooper today from Swedish Scoop.

1620
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,160
 The categories are San and Santa,

1621
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,480
 Shakin' My Spear,

1622
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,760
 Ol' MCD, Deformed Farm.

1623
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,600
 - Do you think that girl went on to blow someone else?

1624
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:50,360
 Like, do you feel like she's also had to retell that story

1625
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,720
 to a partner and be like, you know?

1626
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,080
 - The one who didn't, who wasn't for me.

1627
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:54,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

1628
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,280
 Like, do you think like later she was like, you know,

1629
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,120
 got used to it?

1630
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:58,940
 - Tried another?

1631
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,780
 I doubt it.

1632
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,440
 - Hello, I didn't used to like this nearly as much

1633
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,280
 as I do now.

1634
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,120
 (laughing)

1635
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,520
 But these days, I don't even talk without a cock in my dick.

1636
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,840
 That's right.

1637
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,920
 - Ol' McDonald's Deformed Farm.

1638
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,560
 - Oh, that's what that Ol' McDonald's Deformed Farm

1639
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,800
 and songs I weep for.

1640
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,080
 - Okay.

1641
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:21,920
 - Paul, you're up.

1642
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,760
 - Well, I gotta try Ol' McDonald's Deformed Farm.

1643
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,840
 - For 400, this animal had an ab-ab here

1644
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,460
 and an ab-ab there, here an ab, there an ab,

1645
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,160
 everywhere an ab-ab.

1646
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,400
 That's A-A-B is how ab is spelled.

1647
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,840
 - Oh, geez.

1648
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,680
 - I mean, like a deformed sheep, I guess.

1649
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,820
 - I guess.

1650
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,600
 Oh, a dyslexic sheep.

1651
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,560
 - Oh, they all have a condition.

1652
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,400
 Okay.

1653
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,080
 - All right, we get it now.

1654
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,000
 - All right.

1655
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,840
 - Matt, you're up.

1656
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,820
 - Songs I Weep For.

1657
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:10,840
 - Eponine, I never remember how to say her name.

1658
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,640
 - Eponine sings this song of unrequited love and loneliness

1659
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,720
 in Les Miserables.

1660
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:24,560
 - What's it called?

1661
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:32,400
 ♪ I love him that every day I'm learning ♪

1662
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,000
 - Master of the House, that's it.

1663
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,440
 - Master of the House.

1664
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,520
 - I can't remember, Pass.

1665
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,920
 - Passes to me, shit.

1666
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,920
 All I can think of is, oh wait, is it Castle on a Cloud?

1667
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,400
 - That's the little girl song.

1668
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,560
 - Yeah, I don't remember who is who.

1669
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,460
 I don't remember what French name belongs

1670
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,960
 with what character in Les Mis.

1671
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,500
 - ScooperNovaGirl typed it into the chat

1672
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,840
 if you just want to read it and get it right.

1673
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,440
 - Oh, okay.

1674
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,520
 Why, I can't see the chat.

1675
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,240
 You guys can see the chat during the--

1676
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,800
 - Oh, I didn't realize we had this advantage on you, Jacob.

1677
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,480
 - Oh yeah, no, I can't see the chat during the Scooperties

1678
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,560
 'cause I'm sharing my screen so you guys

1679
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,400
 could see the Scoopertie.

1680
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,440
 - Pretty great.

1681
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:20,320
 - Oh, is it, on my own, on my own.

1682
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,480
 Wait, you can't see the chat?

1683
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,760
 - Hey, you grabbed.

1684
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,600
 - No.

1685
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,640
 - That's so funny.

1686
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,920
 - He grabbed it.

1687
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,760
 - All right.

1688
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,720
 - I mean, I know the show.

1689
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,040
 - You knew the song, yeah.

1690
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,080
 - Yeah, I just had to find it in my head.

1691
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,840
 Me, it's, I don't know what San and Santa is,

1692
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,920
 so let's try that, 400.

1693
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,680
 Jesus' mom in Espanol.

1694
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:48,080
 So, how do you say fictional in Spanish?

1695
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:54,120
 How do you say historical fiction?

1696
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:00,320
 What, so it's just Mary in Spanish?

1697
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
 - I think it's different than that.

1698
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,040
 - Okay, I pass then, Paul.

1699
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,400
 - I think it's Magdalena.

1700
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,720
 - Oh, I see.

1701
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,200
 Santa Maria.

1702
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,440
 - Well, shit on me.

1703
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,800
 - Shit on my penis.

1704
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,400
 - Mary Magdalena.

1705
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,240
 - Paul.

1706
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,720
 - Fucking shit my dick.

1707
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,320
 I'll do songs I weep for for 2000,

1708
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,400
 'cause I gotta get on the board.

1709
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,320
 - Fire Maple Song is a single off the first album

1710
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,600
 by this '90s rock band,

1711
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,000
 better known for Wonderful and Santa Monica.

1712
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,040
 - Oh, that's Everclear.

1713
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,600
 - Everclear is correct.

1714
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,680
 - I saw them at concert.

1715
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,280
 - Paul on the board. - They were terrible.

1716
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,360
 - No.

1717
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,600
 - Yeah, they were awful.

1718
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,880
 - Matt, you're up.

1719
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,000
 - I left before they were done.

1720
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,200
 - I'll do Shakin' My Spear for 400.

1721
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
 - I've never gone out of my way to see Everclear.

1722
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,120
 This tragedy focuses on a pair of star-crossed lovers

1723
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,320
 from Fair Verona.

1724
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,320
 Did you know the girl was only 13?

1725
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,840
 - Yoinks.

1726
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,320
 - It's about Jerry Lee Lewis.

1727
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,320
 - This is Romeo and Juliet.

1728
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,480
 - Romeo and Juliet.

1729
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,880
 Is that the whole answer?

1730
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,280
 I don't know, I forgot what the category is.

1731
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,880
 - I believe that's the answer.

1732
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,280
 - Oh yeah, Romeo and Juliet.

1733
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,120
 I didn't know if it was gonna be like a Romeo and Juliet,

1734
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,720
 get fucked or something like that.

1735
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,640
 (laughing)

1736
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,400
 Let's see, I'll try, I don't know,

1737
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,680
 Shakin' My Spear for 800.

1738
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,520
 Daily double!

1739
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,560
 Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow is a famous soliloquy

1740
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,640
 from this Scottish play.

1741
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,040
 That would be the Scottish play, Macbeth.

1742
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,560
 - MacGregor the Bridge Builder, no.

1743
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,480
 (laughing)

1744
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,520
 - Macbeth is correct.

1745
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,360
 Paul.

1746
01:07:53,360 --> 01:08:00,920
 - I'll try Old MacDonald for 2,000.

1747
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,960
 Wow, this animal had a crack, crack here

1748
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
 and a crack, crack there, here a crack,

1749
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,160
 there a crack, everywhere a crack, crack.

1750
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,440
 - Oh my gosh, it's probably an arthritic duck,

1751
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,720
 but I don't wanna guess for 2,000 points.

1752
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,560
 I'll pass.

1753
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,400
 - Matt.

1754
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,240
 - Pass.

1755
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,120
 - Or what's that condition that Mr. Glass had?

1756
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,200
 - A drug dealing duck.

1757
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,360
 - Oh, drug dealing duck, good lord.

1758
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,960
 See, there's a lot of ways I could've gone,

1759
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,440
 crack, crack here and a crack, crack there.

1760
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,560
 - Yeah, I would've gone like a plumber duck or something.

1761
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

1762
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,680
 - Matt, you're up. - Yeah, I could've been

1763
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,080
 a plumber.

1764
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,520
 - Shake Me My Spear, 1,200.

1765
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,600
 - This title Prince of Denmark asks,

1766
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,880
 am I a coward in Shakespeare's longest play?

1767
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,240
 - Hamlet?

1768
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,880
 - Indeed.

1769
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,520
 - Hamlet is correct.

1770
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,800
 Where's the thing, there it is.

1771
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,080
 Me, I'll try, I'll close out Shake Me My Spear,

1772
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,360
 I actually know these.

1773
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,040
 Shakespeare's wife shares a name

1774
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,960
 with this modern actress of The Dark Knight Rises,

1775
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,960
 Selena Kyle and Le Miserable, Fantine Fane.

1776
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,520
 - It's your girl, Matt.

1777
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,360
 - Oh yeah.

1778
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,920
 - Catwoman.

1779
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,480
 - Batgirl or Catwoman, I don't remember,

1780
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,680
 but it's one of them.

1781
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,720
 - It was actually Catwoman, but she went Batgirl.

1782
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:26,320
 Who was Batgirl in that movie?

1783
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,640
 - I can't think of her name.

1784
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,040
 - Princess Diaries. - I got to pass Paul.

1785
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,360
 - Now you got me on it.

1786
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,040
 - I can't really remember her name either.

1787
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,480
 I don't like her at all.

1788
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,880
 - Pass, baby, pass.

1789
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,440
 - Matt's just sitting there just slowly jacking it.

1790
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,400
 He's just keeping it in half staff, he's ready to go.

1791
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,240
 - I can't remember her name.

1792
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,400
 - All right, half staff, Donnelly, what you got?

1793
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,200
 - And hath a way about her.

1794
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,760
 - Oh, yes, there it is.

1795
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,080
 - Don't know what it is. - And hath a way.

1796
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,840
 Where there is a will and hath a way.

1797
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,880
 - Yeah, she does.

1798
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,920
 I'll try songs that weep four for two, 1200.

1799
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,920
 - It's not time to make a change.

1800
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,880
 Just relax, take it easy.

1801
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,880
 Sings Cat Stephen, Yusef Islam in this tearjerker.

1802
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,400
 - Oh.

1803
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,840
 - Oh, this is a good one.

1804
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,480
 - This one got me, this one got me for real, in real life.

1805
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,440
 'Cause I listened to that, I went to the Cat Stevens binge

1806
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,840
 when I moved to the Virgin Islands,

1807
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,080
 and I was like living off of my own.

1808
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,080
 And then I listened to it after I had a child,

1809
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,760
 and I indeed felt both sides of the song,

1810
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,360
 and it fucking destroyed me.

1811
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,080
 Yeah.

1812
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,560
 - I have to pass 'cause I can't remember the title of the song.

1813
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,760
 - It goes to Matt, what is it?

1814
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,400
 - Father and Son.

1815
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,600
 - Father and Son, that got you?

1816
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,960
 - Believe it or not, yeah, yeah.

1817
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,680
 - Huh, huh, interesting.

1818
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,440
 - I hope you don't ever have kids, it'll really get you.

1819
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,280
 - Yeah.

1820
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:10,840
 - It's really, you know, the lyrics respond back and forth

1821
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,320
 between father and the son, and it's super, super deep.

1822
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,120
 - No, I think it's a really good song.

1823
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,520
 - That they sued, who is that psychedelic band?

1824
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,400
 Ended up just absolutely just copying the song by accident

1825
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,120
 and had to pay up in the lawsuit.

1826
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,960
 - Oh, I don't know.

1827
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:29,800
 - I'll look it up in a sec.

1828
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,160
 'Cause I'm gonna check and look it up.

1829
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,840
 - Was it in the '60s they did it?

1830
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,400
 - No, it was in the late '90s or the 2000s.

1831
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,280
 There's Flaming Lips, that's who it was.

1832
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,120
 - Flaming Lips, yeah.

1833
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,160
 - Oh, Flaming Lips basically ripped one off.

1834
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,320
 - It was too similar to Father and Son.

1835
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,160
 - Yeah.

1836
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,640
 - In the settlement, the bands agreed to a royalty split

1837
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,760
 with Stevens receiving 75% of the publishing royalties

1838
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,800
 for a fight test.

1839
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,640
 - Yeah. - Okay.

1840
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,720
 - Man, Cat Stevens had some good lawyers on that lawsuit.

1841
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,280
 - He sure did, he sure did.

1842
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,280
 - Holy shit.

1843
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,120
 Let's see, what is it?

1844
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,000
 Matt, your turn.

1845
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,960
 - I will do...

1846
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,840
 - Score check, by the way,

1847
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,920
 Matt is crushing both Paul and I.

1848
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,200
 He has 4,800, Paul and I both have 1,200 each.

1849
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,920
 - I can step into it with Daily Doubles here.

1850
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,120
 I'll do songs at week four for 800.

1851
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,120
 - Daily Doubles! - There it comes.

1852
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,960
 - Oh no. - You got this.

1853
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,080
 - From your mouth to my ears.

1854
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,000
 This legendary Academy Award winning song asks,

1855
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
 "If happy little bluebirds fly, why, oh why can't I?"

1856
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,200
 It also ranked number one on AFI's 100 years,

1857
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,880
 100 song list.

1858
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,920
 - That's Baby Got Back.

1859
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,920
 Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

1860
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,920
 - Somewhere Over the Rainbow. - Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

1861
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,080
 - Oh, I just brought back a flashback of Judy Garland

1862
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,120
 singing that 100 feet high in the sphere.

1863
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,920
 - Was it crazy? - I'll try.

1864
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,320
 Yeah, it was, it was really crazy.

1865
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,680
 Santa and Santa for 800.

1866
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,760
 This is what you get when you eat breakfast

1867
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,760
 on the beach in California.

1868
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,200
 High property taxes, am I right?

1869
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,480
 (laughing)

1870
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,600
 - I don't know.

1871
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
 - What's the thing, salmon sand?

1872
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:30,120
 - I have no idea, I'll pass, Paul.

1873
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,800
 - A breakfast sandwich?

1874
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,640
 - Oh.

1875
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,840
 San Diego.

1876
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,360
 - Oh, San Diego.

1877
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,600
 - Yeah, I get it now, Paul.

1878
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,440
 Old Deform McDonald for 1200.

1879
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,800
 - This animal had a rubbit, rubbit here,

1880
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,960
 and a rubbit, rubbit there.

1881
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,280
 Here a rubbit, there a rubbit, everywhere a rubbit, rubbit.

1882
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,200
 - It's gotta be a habitual masturbating frog.

1883
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,000
 - Habitually masturbating frog?

1884
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,880
 Close enough, perverted frog, yes.

1885
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,560
 (laughing)

1886
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,600
 - Man. - A horny toad.

1887
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,920
 - I'll do San Santa. - Oh, horny toad.

1888
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,600
 - 1200. - Great horny toads.

1889
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,840
 - Musicals adore this New Mexico city

1890
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,480
 with characters in both Newsies and Rent,

1891
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,680
 dreaming of running away to there.

1892
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,760
 - Santa Fe?

1893
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,920
 - But how do the songs go, Matt?

1894
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,760
 Come on.

1895
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,280
 - I don't know the Newsies Santa Fe song.

1896
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,800
 ♪ Santa Fe ♪

1897
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,080
 - But I'll do the whole score of Rent for you right now.

1898
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,160
 - The Newsies are trying to get to Santa Fe?

1899
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,000
 - The one, Christian Bale's character,

1900
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,560
 he sings the whole song about Santa Fe.

1901
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,400
 - What?

1902
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,320
 - It's like, it's the big torch song.

1903
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,160
 It's like Santa Fe, I'll be there.

1904
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,000
 I don't remember anymore.

1905
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,400
 - I mean, I've been to the city, it's fine.

1906
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,800
 - It's a perfectly plausible song.

1907
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,640
 - How can that compare to New York?

1908
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,200
 I don't get it.

1909
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,960
 - Well, that's why there's only two songs about it,

1910
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,960
 not the dozens about New York.

1911
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,800
 - I suppose you're right.

1912
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,560
 - Let's see, it's me, I have 1200, Paul has 1600,

1913
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,080
 Matt has 10,800.

1914
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,080
 There are two questions left and no more deadly doubles.

1915
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,560
 - Anybody's game.

1916
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,720
 - I'll try Santa and Santa for 2000.

1917
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,280
 This character threatened Chris the octopus

1918
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,240
 in a heartwarming children's tale.

1919
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,960
 It isn't Chris's fault, he lost his hat.

1920
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:28,800
 - Yeah.

1921
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,960
 - So that's the homeless guy, the bum.

1922
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,920
 - No, no, no, he didn't threaten him.

1923
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,320
 - Okay.

1924
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,080
 - What's the category, Jacob?

1925
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,280
 - Oh, I don't remember.

1926
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,040
 - Santa and Santa.

1927
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,120
 - Oh, he's the bum dressed as Santa?

1928
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:50,960
 Is that what it means?

1929
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,800
 - It's just Santa Claus.

1930
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,200
 Santa Claus is the villain in "Christmapus".

1931
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,200
 - Right, yeah.

1932
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,840
 - Santa Claus is basically the bad guy in "Christmapus".

1933
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,840
 - Isn't Santa Claus the bum though, too?

1934
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:05,440
 - No, he is the surrogate for Rudolph.

1935
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,480
 - Oh, I haven't read "Christmapus" recently enough.

1936
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,040
 - I get that, it's all right.

1937
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,960
 Well, we're working on the sequel.

1938
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,320
 - It'll be a big thing.

1939
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,040
 - Yeah, I'll bone up on the original

1940
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,640
 so I'm not confused by any of the plot lines in the sequel.

1941
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,360
 - We're gonna do some reprints, yeah, it'll be awesome.

1942
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,200
 It's gonna happen.

1943

1950
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,520
 If Mike Tyson was a snake, this is what I would sound like.

1951
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,800
 It's a, it's a, it's a lispy snake.

1952
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,600

1953
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,440
 Nailed it.

01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,240

 are her special weapon kind of thing?

2036

 - Like, no, it's just goes to,

2037
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,080
 like in Gymkhada, it just goes to a village

2038
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,160
 and just people just wanna kill 'em

2039
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,080

2040
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,920
 Is that a bunch of people--

2044
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,920
 - And the village happens to have a pommel horse

2045
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,840
 in the center of it.

2046
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,680

2047
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,600
 - Right, right.

2048
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,080
 'Cause if it's not for that pommel horse, he's dead.

2049
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:06,920

2052
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,920
 - Okay, all right.

2053
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,040
 - There's a ballet bar in the middle of a village.

2054
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,620
 If it weren't for that ballet bar, it should be dead.

2055
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,400
 - One of the whole walls of the village

2056
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,680
 is a mirrored wall with a ballet bar.

2057
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,680
 - Yeah, yeah, they have a ballet bar

2058
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,520
 and a mirrored wall.

2059
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,340

 (laughing)

2067
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,260
 - I had thought of a joke.

2068
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,100

2069
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:38,940
 - I did.

2070
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:39,760
 I had thought of a joke.

2071
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,600
 - Do you want someone else to go?

2072
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,440
 Jacob, go.

2073
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,280
 - Oh, shit.

2074
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,380
 No, I don't have a joke.

2075
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,920
 What do you think I have a joke ready for?

2076
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,760
 - Yeah, don't--

2077
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,080
 - I don't have a joke already.

2078
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,040
 - I'll finish up then.

2079
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,500

 Hey, that Patreon, the whole goddamn thing

2189
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,320
 is about to get turned upside down on its head,

2190
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,240
 not Patreon in general, just ours.

2199
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,720

 - It's legit, the name's legit.

2205
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,160
 - Nominative determinism.
