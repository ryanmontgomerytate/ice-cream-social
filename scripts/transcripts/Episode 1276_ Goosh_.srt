13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:42,640
 go see my wife on New Year's Eve at one of her gigs and failed so miserably. It was

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,360
 terrible. What happened? It was terrible. I had the early show at Absinthe over at

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:58,240
 Caesars Palace. I got done at 10 30 p.m. My wife was less than a mile down the

16
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,740
 road doing a gig with several of our other friends several other close

17
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,440
 friends. Some of them have been on the podcast from the from the Spice Girls show

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,680
 that she does. Right. So I was gonna go down see part of her show hang out with

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,400
 her hang out with our friends on New Year's Eve ring in the new year. It was

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,560
 gonna be great. Well my plan was to walk. No no. And then it was well I was like

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,240
 oh it'll take me a half hour to walk down there but that's not a big deal. I'm

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,040
 not. I wasn't too worried about the walk. Normally. Normally. Well no even with the with the foot

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,160
 traffic I was like it'll take me half hour maybe 40 45 minutes but even then

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,500
 that's okay. I'm not worried about that. It was raining a little bit. It was

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,280
 raining beautiful weather. Yeah. For two weeks and then New Year's Eve it was

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,980
 raining. By the way did not seem to affect Las Vegas tourism negatively at

27
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,040
 all. The earlier reports I saw actually were that it was record record numbers

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,680
 for New Year's Eve. That's right. Oh wow. Yeah even record numbers of trash. 12

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,000
 tons of trash cleaned up on the strip after it was all over. Jacob how did your

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 mom get down to the strip? I'm not 12 tons of trash. I'm Jacob's mom. Yeah well you keep eating them pies you're gonna be 13 tons of trash. I know that my mom listens to the podcast. Hi mom. 13 tons of trash.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,560
 So I walk outside after the shows I gotta go drop off my bag and everything in

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,520
 the car so I go over and drop everything off and it's it's sprinkled rain a

33
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,600
 little bit. I'm like you know what this might this might help me out. This this

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,520
 might be a glass half full moment because this means that nobody else or

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,080
 not as many other people are gonna be out on the actual street. Way to silver

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:07,800
 lining it Jacob. That's really good. It's gonna clear the path for me. Did you did you think about using your scooter? I thought about using the scooter but then I would have then I would have had to like park the

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:21,960
 scooter somewhere. Also the scooter when it is wet at all is a death trap. I guess that's true. Yeah it is horrible to ride that thing if it is slightly wet. Yeah oh god.

38
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:40,720
 Because I mean it's just not heavy enough. It just doesn't it doesn't stay on the ground well enough. So I go outside. Now your mom's on it. Yeah. 15 tons of trash. Put down the pie mom. Boom, boom, boom the hits keep coming. Boom, boom, boom it's my mom

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,600
 walking down the hall. So I like I walk outside. I'm like okay it's misting rain a

40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:05:18,520
 little bit. I'll be you know I'll be a little damp. That's okay. I won't be I won't be soaking wet or anything. This is this is doable. I'll be alright. And so I start walking down the street. I'm out on the strip. It's great you know it's New Year's Eve and on the Las Vegas strip. It's all that stuff. It's all the people watching that goes along with that. Dreams. A lot of dreams in the air. A lot of dreams. A lot of hopes and dreams. A lot of deflated pornographic dreams floating through the ether.

41
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:48,280
 And then it started raining a little bit. Call that six nine six nine six nine number in twenty twenty six. I'm going to get a hold of that dead billboard lady. I'm going to see what that's all about. Hey what's one of them dead. All of them send her to six four eight the Rio please. I was talking to my friend who's a Uber driver. He's talking about how many how many tourists come to town and they take the

42
00:05:48,280 --> 00:06:14,120
 Uber to massage parlors and go like oh I guess oh I don't know if this is the place or you know it's like song and dance. They try to they try to alibi it like about like oh I guess I'll get out here and figure it out. But you know I don't just like I do any time I'm getting dropped off by an Uber at a place that I don't think is my destination. I choose to go ahead and get out and figure it out.

43
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:33,160
 How many I guess most massage parlors in Vegas are connected to human trafficking in some way. Is that how dare you dare you. They're legit foot tension specialists brought here. You leave massage envy alone.

44
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:55,080
 I do. I very much. They're very much top graduates of all the leading reflexology schools. It is that reflexology school in a giant shipping container because it's a scene. It's a college. I would call it a giant shipping container.

45
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:07,440
 Look you say accredited I say seaworthy. These are maritime degrees maritime degrees that are good. I'm degree.

46
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:23,800
 You can get your diploma at sea. I just came here to get a manicure. But sure I'll stick around stick around forever.

47
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,520
 Now you're in a shipping container. It's not even a giant one. It's a regular size one.

48
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:42,720
 Bernie Sanders. It's missing a little bit. And then it's no longer missing. Now it's lightly raining.

49
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:55,640
 It is. It is definitely. There's more water coming from the sky now. Yes. And I know this because I had a gig and I drove to Utah. No problem. Did the show then drove back trying to make

50
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:10,280
 it back to this party in time to be with my kids and stuff. And right. And the rain towards the 10 of midnight was pretty pretty heavy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was a record rainfall for Las Vegas which is which is kind of like which is kind of like having the

51
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,520
 highest rated show on CW like really like what are we talking about.

52
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:40,440
 But we had record rainfall. We did. So I finally gave up. I basically walked from one end of Caesar's Palace to the other outside. Don't mind me guys. I'm just drinking our Christmas gift from Soundstack our hosting company. They didn't send three months. Just one. So we're going to we're going to pass that around. It's going to be a travel.

53
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,360
 Look at that. Is that their emblem. Paul can have it on a pocket. Have it in January. Jacob in February.

54
00:08:48,360 --> 00:09:08,120
 I want it on. I want it on Wednesdays and Fridays. We'll ship it that often. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like three styles of circumcision. That's right. That's what they started off as. It's much like much like the craft food company started off a little niche industry and grew and grew and grew. That's right. That's right.

55
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:19,960
 Walked from one end to the other. Take a drink out of that. And I said, Matt, is that coffee in that mug? He said, more or less.

56
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:38,200
 All right. We last left off. Jacob was so sorry. You're getting you're getting soaking wet. But, Jacob, did you take the advice of the

57
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,040
 MythBusters and just stroll calmly and serenely through the rain? Or did you try to run?

58
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,720
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I I stroll.

59
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,560
 I have a stroller shoving people at the right go like it's raining.

60
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:13,520
 Oh, my God. It's raining. I'm going to melt. I threw my fists out in front of me, flailed them around and ran yelling. It's raining forearm, elbow sweeping just the whole just. Yeah.

61
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,880
 Jeff in the chat is asking a very valid question. Do people even own raincoats or umbrellas in Vegas?

62
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,480
 I don't know if people do, but I know that I do not. I never did. So I keep them in the I keep them in the trunk of my car.

63
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
 You do. I do. Who are you? Because you're a Jersey.

64
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:40,960
 I need to get an umbrella and just keep it in my car. That's it. Your old jersey. Which I definitely used to do, but I never did growing up. We didn't get that much rain in Kentucky.

65
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,920
 No, I was living in New York was always the funniest thing is because they sell they sell umbrellas at all the little little little bodega shops.

66
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:59,640
 And they're there used to be. They're always like, you know, three or four bucks. Then also starts raining and they're ten to fifteen dollars. It just place search umbrellas. Yeah. All the time.

67
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:12,000
 But yeah, that's what I'm going to ask. If you have like a utility umbrella, even at even at work, I thought maybe you might keep one. Someone might have one in the desk or an office. We keep a pile of them at work, but they but they stay there.

68
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:25,480
 Those are just there. They're a bouquet of umbrellas. I have some people have stuffed animal heads on their walls. We have umbrella. I've seen the umbrellas employed at absence during inclement times.

69
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:36,880
 When people have to be ferried from stage to tent and what have you. Yeah. Back and forth. Stage hands have gone out. We have we have like giant golf umbrellas.

70
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:52,680
 Cast members through wet areas and everything we have to big sexy actually makes a really good point. The reason why we have umbrellas handy is not because I'm always thinking about the rain. It's because my kids play outdoor sports and you use an umbrella in the desert just to give yourself shade.

71
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,600
 So what kind of umbrella is it a black umbrella. Is it a

72
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:07,640
 I have a we have a multiple. I have a we have a super wide golf umbrella for keeping to us under the shade of watching color blue and white striped and then I have

73
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:22,840
 Tiny maroon umbrellas that I have for just in case for rain or extra an extra kid in tow or whatever. I can give some kids shade or or if it's raining. I keep goes smart. Yeah. Kenny Kenny in the chat. Yeah, you can't coach soccer without an umbrella.

74
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:35,760
 Matt, was that your was that your issue with your soccer coaching. Did you not have enough umbrellas was you remember we we won our first game. And that's because I entered like Mary Poppins. I took the umbrella and I descended onto the field.

75
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,800
 That gave us a spoonful of sugar before they hit the field.

76
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,240
 Isn't that where that was cocaine.

77
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
 The that's why they want that first game. That was just a spoon of cocaine.

78
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,280
 The Umbro brand. Right. That's just a shorthand for umbrella.

79
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,880
 Umbro Ella. That's why it's such a bit such a big thing in soccer's. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Paul. Second worst joke of the day.

80
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:14,600
 So far I have so far. Exactly. I have yet to start. So what happened. Jacob. Well, I walked from one end of Caesars to the other outside. Yeah. And dripping. I was wet.

81
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:26,560
 Drippy. So finally I gave up on that. I went back inside. Oh, the one silver lining of the whole evening was I stopped at. They had all these extra bars and extra little shops set up.

82
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,200
 So I stopped a little extra shop and because I noticed they had the little airplane bottles of Jameson.

83
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,640
 So I'll I'll get myself a little airplane bottle of Jameson for this. What has turned into a very long walk.

84
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,280
 So I got up and got the airplane ball of Jameson New Year's Eve.

85
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:54,400
 There are no prices on anything. That's right. Same thing with like the bodega umbrella. Oh, God. I mean, a bottle of liquor on New Year's Eve in Vegas is a bodega umbrella in New York.

86
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:07,920
 What was the price for that? Yo little shot bottle shot bottle shot bottle of whiskey. The airplane bottle of whiskey. New Year's Eve at Caesars Palace in a little pop up thing.

87
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,760
 These are normally for these are only just a few bucks at a liquor store. Yeah, this would normally be like three dollars. Right. I think about how

88
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:26,520
 These drinks around town are usually served in very ornate designer thingies. Oh, they put in like some spiraling unicorn deal.

89
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:43,680
 And you're exactly right. Dynamic pricing is what they call it ends up being like a 30 or $35 thing. Maybe a little more depending on how much alcohol. But this is just the simplified thing. But still, New Year's Eve. My guess is just a bottle. My guess my 18

90
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:56,560
 My gut initial is going to be like 10 or $12. Uh huh. But then I went to disco to see one last time with my kids and we bought two bottles of water on the way out. And it wasn't even New Year's Eve.

91
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:18,000
 And it was $10 each for Aquafina bottles. $10. Stop it. They should pay you to drink Aquafina. That's your water. That is the nastiest shit ever. You got to walk outside. You got to just walk outside and find the guys selling the bottles of water on the street. They saw for a dollar or two.

92
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:48,440
 Oh, it's just a case of case of bottled water. They got it. Costco. Who cares? I said, I said like at least put the different label on it. So like at least put like Aqua Tina, at least let me think I'm getting a different spring. That's nicer or put like the put like a casino label on it or something like that. Something. But like when I, when, when you know it's Aquafina face, it was like, like it puts it, it put like a damper in the, in the mood. You're like, Oh, sure. I just went, I just went to Costco. Yeah.

93
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,560
 For under $4, Matt, I walked away with a brick of 40 waters. Right. Well, exactly.

94
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:12,360
 When it comes to aquafina, when Anne and I bought that water at Costco the first time, we went up there and we were getting the, cause it's right up there next to the toilet paper and everything else. I was like, Oh, okay. Here we go. Get some waters. And she goes, I go, how much do you think it is? She goes, four bucks. I was like, no.

95
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:44,160
 She says, yeah, it's four bucks. My God. I mean, you know, you know, who knows that the guys on the escalator selling the bottles of water for $2. They do. They do. I, I nearly had an out-of-body experience. That was amazing. So the prevailing average seems to be around 18 to $20 here in the chat. That's what I'm feeling 18. Yeah. Uh, less than 10 bucks. Oh, okay. I was so pleasantly surprised. Yes. Wow.

96
00:16:44,200 --> 00:17:09,480
 I handed, I handed the guy a 10. I like that. They're gouging people for water, but when it comes to liquor, they're like, no, no, no. Stay true to yourself, fam. You help yourself. We've got to keep you on the straight and narrow the guy, a $10 bill. And that included the tip. And it genuinely, I mean this sincerely. I felt better about Las Vegas.

97
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:35,160
 Oh, somebody gets it. There's still charging three times, four times. They paid for this, but it's still making an amazing problem. It was a gentlemanly markup. It was like this. I can live with this because I was ready for him to be like, Oh, that's $25. Right. That's what I was prepared for.

98
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:57,920
 Oh, I was, I was so, that was, that was the only good part of my night. So I drank my little baby bottle of Jamison walking. I did. I just, I just, I sipped on that as I walked through. And, uh, well, this is not a good way to put this. Now that I, now that I hear myself saying this out loud, I sipped my little baby bottle of Jamison as I walked.

99
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:31,000
 I hear that out loud now as I say it. And, uh, so I went to my car. So they close off the strip, close off the cops. Cannot ask you to open a baby bottle. That's a fact. It's just a constitutional fact. They gotta, they gotta have a warrant. If they want to know what's inside that baby bottle. That's what makes it different. No officer. I'm not using my baby bottle there to conduct business on a federal highway. So I don't need to have a driver's license. It's fine.

100
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:43,680
 What do you say? I'm a, I'm transporting. Look at my binder of paper. I'm transporting this baby bottle. Not driving it. Baby bottle. And I'm not doing it for interstate commerce.

101
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:56,760
 So I, I, uh, I go to the car and they close off all the roads around the strip. You can't drive on the strip. It's all pedestrian and everything. And the problem is SJ's gig is on the other side of the strip.

102
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:22,240
 That's a big problem. That's a big problem. And so I spend about an hour, uh, driving around to different, uh, roads that the map says is open and they are all closed and then finally at about 11, 15, 12, uh, 11 30, 11 40, some, somewhere like that.

103
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,280
 I finally just say, fuck it. If I turn right down this road, that will lead to my house. So that is where I'm going.

104
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 So I drove to my house. I let the dogs out. We watched the fireworks from the backyard. It was fine.

105
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:48,840
 And then SJ came home a few hours later and brought friends home. And then I was up until six 30 in the morning anyway. So I did all of that and then didn't get to sleep early.

106
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:09,840
 That sounds like a pretty good night overall. It was fine. It was perfectly nice how true SJ is to herself. I love that. She can always, always rally people after hours. No problem. Everybody on the year. You got 30 in the morning. Here comes SJ on New Year's Eve.

107
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,640
 It's like call it a night. You know, it's, it's, it's blood money when you work on New Year's Eve, especially on the strip.

108
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:34,640
 And, uh, no, no, it's, it's SJ had been out since like, I think she left the house at like 1:00 PM that day and was gone. Right. Like she, she took a shower and got into full makeup at like one o'clock in the afternoon because then she had multiple sound checks and multiple gigs and everything.

109
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:44,040
 And then 2 a.m. 2 30 in the morning. Here she comes rolling into the house with people and you go like, get the whiskey ready. I got people coming.

110
00:20:45,440 --> 00:21:04,840
 I'm doing a show with your wife on January 14th. Sarah has to Ross is hosting a variety show downtown. Wow. Oh, nice. I didn't know about this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just got the, uh, so good. She sends you slides for you to post on social media. She makes them herself and gives them to you, which is so nice.

111
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:35,840
 And that's as good as great at the socials. We know this. Exactly. We flipped through and I saw SJ out there and I was like, Oh, great. I'm doing the same show as SJ. Nice. Yeah. January 14th at the composer's room. I think it's called. Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's a nice. That's a nice room up there too. Also a friend of the show. She had a Christmas is doing that show, which I'm very excited. Yeah. So it should be a fun one. I've seen her in a long time. Yeah. I'll tell you who else walked around all night on New Year's Eve and didn't really get much done. And that is the following sponsor.

112
00:21:36,040 --> 00:22:05,600
 Today's show, man, man. These ice cream social is brought to you by from the makers of dangerously inaccurate AI generated medical school textbooks. It's robot timeshare salesman for cryptocurrency based feeding tubes, IVs and ventilators. That's from the gorilla dentist from the Bjork video in 2024. I'll say it one more time for the makers of the dangerously inaccurate AI generated medical school textbooks. It's robot timeshare salesman for cryptocurrency based feeding tubes, IVs and ventilators.

113
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:34,440
 Hey, how are you? I hope your day is going well. Are you in the market for medical equipment? If so, come and buy some from me. I'm a robot who sells medical equipment that's been made using AI technology.

114
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:59,360
 The needles kind of work the tubes also sort of work. Also, I will. I'm basically a euthanasia robot. That's the whole thing.

115
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:24,080
 You buy equipment from me and it malfunctions. Giant quotes around malfunctions. I make murder tools for the medical industry. Are you tired of granny? Are you sick of Uncle Joe?

116
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:40,120
 You're going to kill them. No, not directly. I will sell you faulty medical equipment that will lead to their demise. Hello.

117
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:52,680
 Yeah, I'm here. My grandmother is she's a little she's a little sick. She's got a little cough, but she's also just a pain in my ass. Do you have anything for that?

118
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:04,960
 This is gauze made with AI. It's basically hemp rope. Tie it tautly around her neck and leave it for four to three hours.

119
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:28,680
 I hate scoops at checkout. Four to three hours. Four to three hours. Here's an amount of time. That robot is dumb. That's actually robot in jail's cousin. It's not the same guy though.

120
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:48,120
 A few. Oh, good to know. Good to know. Good. Good. Different. Tracy, the bus driver scoop. It is Tracy, the bus driver scoops birthday today. Longtime supporter of the show. Tracy, the bus driver scoop. Love you. Happy birthday. Yeah, heck.

121
00:24:48,120 --> 00:25:16,120
 Yeah. So that was my New Year's Eve, gents. How was yours? I hope yours was less wet. Mine was soaking wet. I was in bed by about eight o'clock. Yeah, Paul's was soaked with passion. I was in bed early and I wasn't feeling great. And we got a crazy snowstorm. We ended up with over six inches. And I was like, Yeah, you did. This is some bullshit.

122
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:46,480
 I was up and down all night, not being able to sleep because I wasn't feeling well. And I got up at 1 30 to let the dogs out. And we were in the middle of a squall. So I opened up the door and it was just whoosh. Snow just, I was like, just come straight into the house. This is just too much to do. I'd say it'd be one thing if I didn't feel 100%. It'd be one thing if the roads

123
00:25:46,880 --> 00:26:16,560
 could possibly kill my Kia. I can't deal with both. So I called out for New Year's Day. I was supposed to go with you do not have an automobile that is built for no weather on the roads. No, not an automobile that is built for perfect weather on the roadway, which is why it served me so well in Las Vegas. But out here in PA, things get dicey. And even when there's just a little bit like I was slipping and sliding even today,

124
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:46,440
 driving, driving home. So the last time we had a really bad storm like this, and I pushed through, I think we need to get Paul Mattingly a Silverado. I pushed through and I went through and I almost put it into a wall. Yeah. But yeah, and got that newer Honda and it. It's got snow mode. So she she fears nothing. Oh, and got snow mode. We know this about him. Do you tire shop out there, Paul? What

125
00:26:46,440 --> 00:27:16,000
 kind of tires do you get to make sure you're mine are just all weather kumos. They're, you know, top notch kumos. Okay. All right. Yeah, they're fine. They're fine. They're the tires that came with the car back in the day. So yeah. But I just drive with snow chains on just in case no matter what. Yeah, just constantly chewing up chewing up the roads. I just I could I couldn't I I just I was like, No, I'm not gonna risk this.

126
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,880
 For a five hour shift where I could die. So I went back to sleep. And, yeah.

127
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,560
 Mike Nielsen in the chat is correcting you, Paul. It's pronounced come ho.

128
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:57,200
 That is the massage parlor. I go to when I drive. How did I end up here? I had no idea. I just typed come ho in the Googles. I how did I get combo? Oh, my goodness. I'm looking I'm looking for just some kind of nice massaging thing.

129
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:16,200
 We're just looking for a reasonable. I was going to massage tires. I was going to rub tires and see which ones are the best. That's what I came out here to do. That's what I was gonna do. Kick the tires like the fire. I guess I'll go check it out, though.

130
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:26,680
 I sent Paul a picture with me and his old stage manager for for New Year's Eve. That's what I was very sweet. Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,080
 We're talking from what second city. Nice. My friend, Brooke Walquist. Yeah.

132
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:49,160
 Yeah, we were. We were. I made it end up making it back. So I went out to Utah to do a show and a factor that made me nervous in the beginning and thankful at the end is that I forgot there's a time change between Las Vegas and Utah.

133
00:28:49,920 --> 00:29:01,200
 Right now, I was I was leaving to be over two hours early anyway, just in case. Right. So I ended up getting there just like an hour and a half for my show, which still plenty of time to set up and do everything still.

134
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:17,680
 But it was the spring Springdale Community Center in Springdale, Utah, which is just outside of Zion National Park. I never came to any of those cute little towns. There's a bunch of cute little tourist kind of cabinet towns. Yeah, they're very nice and

135
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:32,680
 We did a show there. And so my show was from 730 to 830 was actually 630 to 730 Vegas time, which meant when I finished up even packing and everything and and taking pictures and all that stuff, I still was able to get back

136
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:42,160
 To my my family's New Year's Eve party at a local neighborhood. And I guess Paul's old stage manager lives in my neighborhood. She was

137
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,960
 At our mutual friend, the Camusso's house and getting to talking

138
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,160
 She was like, you know, Paul Mattingly and I was like, I love Paul Mattingly

139
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:58,000
 To know him is to love and I was like, boy, I know him.

140
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,360
 In the biblical sense, we spent a good 20 minutes just raving about Paul going back and forth about Paul and then I took a little photo with them. But I did the show up in Utah.

141
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,280
 And it was, you know, real quick on that just that's really sweet. I just want to keep talking about me for a minute.

142
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:25,760
 But no, that's really, really nice. And, you know, Brooke, Brooke really helped me out early on. And she really did help lobby for me early on getting on.

143
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:36,320
 I brought up, I go, I go, I can't believe it took a like a, as I said, it took a letter campaign to get Paul in the second city main stage or whatever. She goes, oh, that was such, you know, whatever. And she just talked about the politics of second city.

144
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,160
 And how annoying it was and all the things she navigated and stuff.

145
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,480
 But yeah, yeah. And she was, she was very sweet when she left.

146
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,400
 She wrote notes to everybody and the note she sent sent to me said,

147
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,520
 I might not always be your boss, but I'll always be a fan. And I thought that was really, really sweet.

148
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
 Oh, wow.

149
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:08,240
 Yeah, she really did champion me getting onto that main stage spot. So I appreciate that from Brooke big time. Yeah.

150
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:20,240
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, she was good. Yeah, I heard her husband were great. I got to chat with them a little bit, super fun. But yeah, so so the event up in Utah was simply for locals who want to come to CUNY Center, they could

151
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,760
 be taught to country line dance, eat a nice, eat a nice meal, and then get a, you know, an entertainment event, which was me.

152
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,800
 How did the line dancing teaching go for you?

153
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,880
 Man, I'm trying to set up and it was like, I was playing like Frogger, right? Like I'm trying to run stuff out and like everybody's just moving like all over the place that I'm trying to carry.

154
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,520
 And I don't want them.

155
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,840
 And I don't want them to

156
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,680
 look at the props, see all your stuff. Right.

157
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:02,000
 So I'm like, you know, just trying to like, keep all eyes on my eyes. Like I'm looking up at anyone looking at me like, you know,

158
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:11,760
 seeing your fish. Yeah. It was like, it's like a like ninja camp for misdirection. It was like, I like this a lot. Can you get all these people to not look at the stuff you're carrying in your hands?

159
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,200
 And so and then it was funny is that like someone was teaching them the steps, but she was just shouting

160
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,720
 over the top or whatever. And so like while I'm in my little changing area dressing room, IE someone's office.

161
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,160
 I just keep hearing just shouting like and laughed.

162
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,640
 To right dip and just like just screaming instructions.

163
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,960
 And I was like, this is a loser voice.

164
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:52,600
 That's so wild. Now, I guess, were they able to respond properly to these commands? Do they know what they meant instinctively? Or did she have to be like,

165
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,800
 you know, a little more descriptive of the

166
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:05,480
 I don't know. I don't think it was like a square dance ball. I was too busy focused on getting your shit up. I was too busy putting weird shit in my pockets in the right order.

167
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:22,920
 To to figure it out. But then they had dinner. And then I did the show. And it was fine. Like I went up there, my mic didn't work. And I switched the other mic. And that mic also was feeding back.

168
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:35,880
 And then I just said, you guys can hear me. Yes. And then I did the whole show kind of just really kind of talking loudly. Yeah. But it worked. It worked out fine. It was a great show. Super fun. Great audience.

169
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,080
 You know, think about the secret thing about love playing shows in

170
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,800
 Jeff Lewis and chances. If Matt had real magical powers, he would need to load things in his pockets. What a hack.

171
00:33:50,280 --> 00:34:02,840
 I just saw I just saw a tick or tick tock where this lady was said, my what's that thing? They say my hot take or what have you.

172
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:14,720
 Uh huh. You know, my hot take is that some magicians are actually magic and they just start practicing magic because they can do magic and it's easy for them.

173
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,800
 And they just and they hide the fact that they're magic by doing magic.

174
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,200
 That's the that's a great it's a that's the logic that made me think I could fool Penn and Teller is

175
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,560
 With a with a trick that Penn showed you.

176
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,800
 Yes. Maybe maybe I could have double bluffed it.

177
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:52,200
 This is going way too far back. Matt's first appearance on fool us. If you had somehow just put something in there to make it try to appear as though you were doing a different method on it.

178
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:04,400
 Yeah. He was paranoid. I was paranoid that I was. Yeah. But about halfway through it was like, no, he's not the trick. Like I taught him. I was only I was only 14 months into magic.

179
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,920
 How to throw any bells and whistles on something, you know, all you are now. All you had to do is dress up like a horse and cut off your thumb.

180
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:29,000
 You would have got one pretty pretty. I didn't do proper misdirection for Penn and Teller, which is actually injuring yourself.

181
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,440
 Feeding blood to European magicians.

182
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:50,880
 So I finished the show and a woman comes up and she's like, you work with Penn and Teller and she starts talking to me. And she seems like as as politely as I can phrase it. Something has happened with her brain at some point in her life.

183
00:35:50,880 --> 00:36:00,560
 I don't know. I don't have to say anymore. I don't have to guess anymore anymore. Just whatever the way is to say

184
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:22,520
 something, something, something happened. I don't know. With this person, was she a football player? Yeah, she was. She was. She just finished the season. She just lost her starting spot in the Miami Dolphins Quinn viewers. And so she had free time.

185
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,880
 His lady's name was Richie incognito.

186
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:58,920
 So she's like, I really like them. Oh, it's good. I always want to see their show in Vegas. Now's a great time to see it. You know, it's like it's it's it's it's the just the 20th year. Right. So 20th year at the Rio. It's their 50th year as a duo. But they just finished up all of their 50th anniversary obligations. And so right there, they're hunkered down at the Rio for the time being. Oh, good. And she goes, I'm a little out of it because I just had major surgery.

187
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:22,960
 Don't stop it. Okay. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. And I'm glad like today, like this procedure just happened like few hours ago. Are you fresh from the things that were happening in the, in the place that was line dancing? My husband's magic was the doctor's. Oh, R is the trunk of my car.

188
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:46,780
 Took the turns a little fast on the way here. No, I said, Oh, I'm sorry to hear. I'm glad you made it. You made it out. And I hope you have a recovery. You know, made it out to the show, you know, surgery. I'm glad you die.

189
00:37:49,320 --> 00:38:06,400
 She might've pulled pulled an RJ Owens. That's right. And our companion is with her. I don't know who her companion is, but gentlemen, companion is a guy with her. I don't know, could be brother. It could be whatever, but male companion, at least male presenting companion.

190
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:20,960
 It's his job here that I'm more concerned about. Like for example, if he was like, Oh yes, she would love to see Penn and Teller, right? If I felt like I had like a, an accurate wing guy, I might've been like, all right, well, let me see if I can help you out kind of thing.

191
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:36,360
 But I did not feel like the, that I could accurately exchange information with this woman in order to facilitate tickets. So I just said, good luck. Or did you trust this wingman? And I think he didn't step up, right? So I was like, he's hanging back. So he's just letting her hang. I'm going to let it hang. I don't know.

192
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,240
 She has the ability to travel.

193
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,400
 That's always a lot. Yeah. A long way to go for not necessarily any dividends there.

194
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:54,960
 So she starts talking about our show. I agree. We see it again, Jacob, a Penn and Teller show. I agree. It's, it's a long way to go to see a Penn and Teller show without a whole lot of benefit.

195
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:24,600
 Well, now, wait. So she starts to talk about her operation and she talks about how her nose lit up red when the surgeon missed his mark. And she went, and I said, I'm glad you're better or whatever. And I'm kind of give a glance, not a, not a, not a knowing glance, but just a quick look over to be like, cool. Like, do you want her to keep talking about this operation?

196
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:42,840
 Right. Like, do you want this or whatever? Everybody's still happy with this interaction. Okay. He is just hands and pockets on his heels. And then she lifts up her sweatshirt and lowers her sweatpants to show a gigantic scar across the entire torso of her body.

197
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:52,560
 Oh, they, they opened her up. I was like, wow.

198
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,800
 You have been believed you before. I hope you didn't note skepticism and the major operation.

199
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:21,280
 Did she say, I, uh, I love Penn and Teller because I like when they saw a lady in half. It reminds me of my operation. It reminds me of lunch today. I think I could fill in for the cut in half lady. Take that on my resume.

200
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,440
 Matt, how, how fresh did the, uh, did the incision look, uh, fresh?

201
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:38,960
 Oh no. Like not today. Not today, but it was recent. Was it glistening? Was it oozy? Was it oozy and glistening? Was it moist?

202
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:52,640
 Did you want to focus on this? Okay. But were there, were there like black stitches in it? Yes. Oh, it's fresh. Oh, that's like, that's like within a week and a half, dude. Yes. Those things don't hang around long.

203
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:04,720
 No, it was maybe. Oh my God. Oh Lord. What's she doing at a magic show line dance combo dancing. I hope she was sitting down for the dancing.

204
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:12,680
 Well, my doctors told me not to, but you know, me, I can't, I love me some dancing.

205
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:32,960
 I, I'd like to compliment your show. Best compliment I can give you as a comedic magician. I found you truly side splitting. Look at my open wounds. You split my sides open you bastard.

206
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:40,320
 I really enjoyed your show today. It was, uh, it was a very nice show. I, I, uh, in lieu of a tip, I am giving you a kidney.

207
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:53,200
 You, you ripped me a**hole to appetite. You opened me wider than the mammoth cave. You crack me like the Liberty bell.

208
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,840
 Oh, Boston.

209
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:10,720
 I just was like, okay. Okay. Yes. She was literally in stitches. And he literally like, he like very generally was like, okay.

210
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,840
 Like, but he still, that wasn't like, you know, Hey, you know, like, let's say, let's keep it together. You know, whatever. It just was like, let's keep it together. I don't know.

211
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:33,680
 So I would stop the person that the associate. Yes. Or, uh, uh, whoever, whoever the person with her handler, romantic other. What do you think? Did you get any vibe for the relationship?

212
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,520
 My vibe, if I had to guess was romantic other.

213
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:54,800
 Do you think because he was romantic other during this, what can I say? Reveal of delicate damage body.

214
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:19,040
 Someone else has it already said a million times. Do you think that he was also like, Oh God, what am I married to now? Was this like a Frankenstein moment? Was he like, the sepsis got to her noggin and things didn't go right? Like, like, is this like a, is this the one of those times?

215
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:31,600
 I have been begging her to show me this car as she would not. And then you fancy pants, magician come walking in here. Right. Right. All of a sudden, Matt just gets punched.

216
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:38,160
 Is he, did you, did you get the vibe that he was like a scar feliac?

217
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:59,920
 Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He just was really, when she revealed the scar, he just buddy armed me. It was like, huh? Oh, he comes over. He's like, I've got it. I've got a cut of the lion king where it's only that lion with the scar on his eye. It's very short, but very gratifying.

218
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:13,680
 This guy just, he lives for flesh wounds. He was simply, that's what floats his boat. That's what gets his McGillicoh passive. He just was simply so like, yeah, yeah. You know, like we had a good time. You know, it was very just, he just was home.

219
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:23,680
 Well, maybe he's, he's had his way with that new scar. And now he's like, well, now I just got to wait for the next operation. Why do you think it was still so pink? He can't get turned on anymore.

220
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:42,320
 She got that operation a month and a half ago, but he's just totally overwhelmed. And now he's over it. Yeah. That's how it goes. You always want, which you can't have. He just, he's just an Uber driver who waits by the hospital for this phone to do.

221
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:50,480
 Hey, how'd it go? Oh yeah. Stitches.

222
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,040
 Hop in. Cause you know what? You know, the old saying stitches, lose britches.

223
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:07,520
 You go and cancel it on your phone. This one's on me. This is not me. Stitches lose britches. Get in.

224
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:18,480
 I'll tell you who else has turned on sexually by surgical scars. That's the following sponsor.

225
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,400
 Today's show is brought to you by goose, the musical. It's from Mike Nielsen. That's goose, the musical.

226
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:37,040
 Uh, give me some music, Jacob. What kind of music would you like? I don't care. All right. If I could even hear it.

227
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,200
 The surgery didn't go exactly how I wanted it to go.

228
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:59,680
 But I'm here at the dance hall slash magic show.

229
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:08,240
 I want to show off my belly, the stitches to the magic man

230
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,720
 And let him put his fingers into my severed calf.

231
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:27,440
 This is terrible. Goosh. Matt's out. Goosh. Goosh goes the wound in my belly.

232
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:40,240
 Goosh. Goosh. Goosh goes the sore on my side. My belly. Goosh. Goosh.

233
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:51,920
 Goosh. Go my stitches inside me. Goosh. Goosh. Goosh. I've turned into a slip and slide.

234
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,840
 This is where my, my mental note is. I can't share this episode's Instagram

235
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:07,360
 because we'll get demonetized because Paul was singing the goose song.

236
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:17,440
 That's a number one hit the goose song. Goosh. There it is. Multiple vomit emojis

237
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:25,760
 from a scooping over girl in chat. Uh, because it was so good. Yes. Because it was so good.

238
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,680
 But she comes back with goose episode titles. So I don't know.

239
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,760
 See, this is the thing you got to understand about me, Matt.

240
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:43,520
 I think you do understand that I will take it there and make you love it.

241
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,320
 This is like, this is the, this is where I hope someone's like at the,

242
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,920
 like the drive through pharmacy or the bank or receiving a traffic ticket from the scar

243
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:13,920
 of my belly is just blaring out as they exchange money. We have confirmed ruin at

244
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:25,520
 least one scoops dinner. The best thing about Goosh is it doesn't tell you.

245
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:34,800
 It could be anything. That's genuinely the best thing about Goosh. It's something emanating from

246
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:46,800
 a wound. I leave the rest to your fertile imaginations. There are multiple things that

247
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,840
 can emanate from a wound. Well, here I am just writing the whole fucking musical. I better pump

248
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:06,960
 my breaks. Yeah. TM TM is right. If you can do a musical called corn, I can do a musical called

249
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,600
 goose. Oh, I would watch, I'd watch goose over corn or whatever, 10 times out of 10. You have

250
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:22,160
 that correct. That is correct. That's what I mean. People that made that show. All right. Time for

251
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:35,920
 Goosh. Goosh out of hell. Yeah. Uh, yeah, it probably does have a meatloaf vibe. I, uh, oh,

252
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:43,440
 there's also the, the, the, the big hit song from Goosh. Yeah. Something happened to my brain at

253
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:54,400
 some point. That's the torch song number at some point, something happened to my brain.

254
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,320
 And right before intermission, of course, it's the big, the big surgical race Goosh lightning.

255
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:10,320
 There's an operating room in the back of my car.

256
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:23,520
 It's very hard to steer while he's operating on me in the car. Cut me up, cut me down,

257
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,600
 cut me all around in the car. Ooh, so nice. Goosh lightning.

258
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:35,680
 Something's emanating from that scar.

259
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:47,280
 Goosh. What could it be? Feed me. The scar goes quadro slash Audrey.

260
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,840
 I loved, did you guys see the, uh, the Christmas ad with Travolta in it with him doing the, uh,

261
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:59,440
 the grease lightening thing with the Santa sleigh? What was that? Did you notice how they didn't even,

262
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,000
 I have no idea what it's for. Uh, did you notice how they didn't even try to match up

263
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,560
 the lyrics with his mouth movements? No, they were like, it seems like for like three hours.

264
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:22,160
 It was like, yeah, we got that shot moving on. No sir. We didn't get moving on wheels up in 10.

265
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:29,040
 Let's go. Like his mouth is not moving close to what the words are doing.

266
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,320
 It's weird. And yeah, I have no idea what that ad is for. Uh, I forgot.

267
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:44,800
 Did I talk to you guys about the club gray skull She-Ra hat or was that another thing?

268
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,560
 I don't think you talked to us about it. No, I don't think it was about us.

269
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:56,880
 Okay. Cause I, I guess I talked about it during the scoop chat, but yeah. So if you go on Mattel

270
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:06,720
 creations website, Mattel creation, all the time, which I do all the time. I do. Uh, but, uh, you

271
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,560
 know, they have club gray skull, which is their little thing. And they, they sell merchandise.

272
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:20,160
 And one of the things they sell is, uh, a new hat that they've created just in the last couple of

273
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:28,000
 weeks. It's She-Ra's 40th anniversary. So they decided to make a She-Ra hat. Okay. But what

274
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:43,440
 they've done is they've created Schrodinger's ball cap. It is a red baseball hat, which given

275
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:53,200
 today's political climate has ramifications and, and, and yeah, it, it, it means something. Right.

276
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:04,640
 Right. However, this red baseball cap also, there it is has the words She-Ra princess of power

277
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:15,120
 written on it. So I don't know that a lot of She-Ra fans are going to want to go around in a red

278
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:26,000
 baseball cap. This might be the target demo. This is just for Sydney Sweeney, just for seducing me.

279
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,200
 That's exactly what this is. Absolutely. I would assume is some kind of, I would, if I saw that

280
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,920
 hat, cause the She-Ra's font's very small. Yeah, it is. And the wings are pretty big. That's the

281
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,400
 weird thing to me about it is that it's not, not that it's red, but that's her, that's her helmet.

282
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,960
 From far away, I would have thought it was a, uh, military background Republican. Uh, that's what I

283
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,800
 would think if I saw that hat from afar. Yeah. Right. Right. So I don't know what Mattel is

284
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:02,160
 smoking that they would choose a red cap. I get it so far as color coordinate, but you could go

285
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:09,040
 white. You could go blue. You could go pink or whatever. Many years ago was why when I went to

286
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:15,760
 like wine country and we bought, I bought this red trucker hat from his diner in, uh, uh, uh,

287
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,040
 Northern California. And I was wearing it around and I was at first getting compliments,

288
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,600
 make America great again on it on my cool diner, like vintage diner trucker hat. Right. And then

289
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,440
 all of a sudden, one day I got mistaken for a mega hat and it was, uh, a guy giving me a thumbs up

290
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,800
 from across the coffee shop. Uh, and my friend being like, he thinks you're wearing a mega hat.

291
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,520
 And I was like, what? I was like, no. And at that time I was like, how many people are really

292
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:55,280
 wearing those? Um, Oh, you sweet summer child. Oh, I was, I missed it by a mile. And, uh, uh,

293
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,720
 but yeah, I eventually had to stop wearing it. Cause everyone was starting to think of it was

294
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,040
 a mega hat. Oh, you got a, you got one of your hats ruined. Cause people said it looked like a

295
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:15,120
 mega hat. That's tough shit. Jacob has absolutely been victimized by that on camera. What happened

296
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:21,520
 right here with his Las Vegas hat that is Las Vegas aviator hat is much better than the one I'm

297
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:30,000
 talking about for my trucker trucker hat. It just happens, happens to look weird. Uh, there's a guy,

298
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:39,600
 there was a guy driving down my street and you know, that, that sketch and I think you should

299
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,720
 leave with the call, like the, the driving crooner or whatever it's called, where he puts the,

300
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:51,600
 the stickers makes it look like he's smoking a cigar and wearing it on the window. Yeah. Uh,

301
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:58,640
 in the back of this guy's truck, in the cab section behind his main cab, he has, you know,

302
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,960
 how you can put a little sticker on the window. Yes. He's got, he's got our president in the back

303
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,280
 seat, the neck and head of the president, you know, looking like, Oh, he's sitting in the back seat.

304
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:20,240
 He's doing it around the neighborhood. And I casually yelled out the window.

305
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:28,000
 He didn't hear me of course, but I warned him, you've got a pedophile in your truck. Look out,

306
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,120
 careful. He's behind you. Um, yeah. So may have fallen on deaf ears.

307
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:42,000
 Maybe, maybe, uh, feel free to always give Matt a thumbs up if you see him wearing a red hat from

308
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,040
 now on two thumbs up in his scars. It's like, it's like where I've had to wear my hooters jacket.

309
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,640
 And, uh, cause there's too much weight in my, in my bags. And then I get some, like, I get

310
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:02,640
 compliments on like nice jacket. And you're like, no, no, please don't. It is not. Please don't.

311
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,360
 Let's do a little joke versus nerd.

312
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
 Fuck. Yeah. I'm on the hunt for balls.

313
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:25,200
 On the hunt for balls.

314
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,560
 Scar goose.

315
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:37,600
 We got a scooper coming to us today from Smitty scoop. I said the, the sum up here operated

316
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,720
 a scooper for you. But first year of the final 20, 25 Smitty scooper, scooper statistics,

317
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,120
 uh, much like tiny pyramid at the top of the obelisk that we don't talk about the, uh, there,

318
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:53,600
 these is a tiny chance that you play. Oh, okay. There is a tiny chance that we might play this,

319
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:00,320
 but we didn't, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 2025 points. Okay. Matt has 10,800. Paul has 2000.

320
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:06,960
 I have negative 4,400. Uh, best game score for Matt was 4,800. Best one for Paul was 6,400.

321
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,800
 Best one for me was 4,400 worst game scores. I have negative 6,000. Paul has negative 6,800.

322
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,480
 Matt has negative 2000. Uh, there's a lot of other stats on here. I do not get any scoops.

323
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,040
 You don't do well traditionally with it. I didn't do well with them in 2025 though.

324
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,600
 Yeah. Uh, while Matt still has the most all time wins,

325
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,560
 Paul and Jacob actually tied with the most 20, 25 wins. Oh, look at that. Oh yeah. It's

326
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:40,560
 time to find out. I lost my Smitty touch in 20, 25 as I recall. Yeah. You've lost that Smitty touch.

327
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:50,640
 So the categories are sitcom spouses, geography, spelling, and random. Uh,

328
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,120
 Matt, you're up first. What do you want? Random 400.

329
00:58:53,120 --> 00:59:00,000
 Let's see here. Since you cannot remember the nickname of professional dart player,

330
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,480
 Tim Pucey, name four of the 10 best nicknames that you previously came up with for him.

331
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,120
 Wait, wait. What if I remember his nickname now?

332
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:17,680
 Specifically the ones that you came up with. Uh, cause it was Pucey magnet is his nickname.

333
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,920
 Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Uh, the magnet. I like that we all remember that now. Uh, dripping

334
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:35,200

338
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:24,800
 Yep. That's me. I'll try a sitcom spouses 400. What is the name of the actress who played Jill

339
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:31,840

340
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:38,960

341
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:46,480
 Barbara something I have to pass Barbara something. Matt, I think Barbara Walters.

342
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,920
 I'm married to Tim Taylor. I have no idea how this has happened.

343
01:00:51,920 --> 01:01:01,440
 Patricia Richardson, Barbara, Barbara, Patricia, Barbara, Richard said, Paul,

344
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:08,560
 I'm going to do sitcom spouses for eight. Cause this is fun. What is the name of the actress who

345
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:14,960
 played Deborah Barone, a wife of Ray Barone for nine seasons on everybody loves Raymond.

346
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:25,440
 Oh, oh, I do. Wait, I would know her name. She did commercials for the grocery store like a

347
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:34,000
 bitch, like a bitch. She was real mean about them. She was real mean about her grocery store

348
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:43,440
 commercials. Yeah. I don't know her name. I have to pass Matt, Rachel Maddow. No, Rachel Maddow,

349
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:54,880
 pass pass pass. Goosh. Patricia Heaton. Patricia Heaton. Hey, uh, uh, Rachel, let's for dinner.

350
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:06,960
 I'm married to Rachel Maddow now. Oh boy. My, my, my giant brother still wants to fuck my wife.

351
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:17,840
 My mom and dad are mean. Oh boy. Rachel Maddow didn't solve anything. Goosh.

352
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:28,400
 It was my turn. I'll take a random for 800. On episode 1264, Matt discussed the guilt that he

353
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,640
 felt working for F1 at the same time that F1 was making the lives of his friends and neighbors

354
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,920
 miserable. But Paul said, what can you do? You got to ride the blank.

355
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:45,920
 This is the same thing as a t-shirt question, isn't it? I forget what he said. And Paul,

356
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,760
 I know for a fact, Paul doesn't remember what he said. I think we've got to ride the devil,

357
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:57,040
 ride the devil, ride the devil or ride the devil's Dick or ride the demon. Yeah. Uh,

358
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:03,520
 Paul has given you three options. I'll pass as well. Paul, I think it's ride the devil,

359
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:11,680
 ride the devil. Yeah. Oh yeah. Apparently I requested the, the, oh yeah, that's right.

360
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,920
 I requested the ride the devil shirt. See, I remember all the framework, just not the

361
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,680
 specifics. You're out here complaining about people not having t-shirt stuff going on, Jacob,

362
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:26,080
 get Brogan on it. Brogan, you're in the chat somewhere. Are you sleeping? I don't think I,

363
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,880
 I, I questioned the viability of the ride the devil t-shirt craze, but that's fine.

364
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:40,320
 Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Scoops prove him wrong. Let's sell out of ride the devil t-shirts.

365
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,480
 Let's everybody have a ride the devil t-shirt day. I'm going to random for 1200.

366
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:54,240
 How many us States border Mexico? All right. A hundred. Well, there's there's California.

367
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:07,120
 That's a big one. There's Texas. That's a big one. Yep. I mean is right out. I think it's just those

368
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:17,840
 two. Very big. Uh, wait, there's a, isn't there a geography category? How is this not the geography

369
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:24,560
 category? Um, what's the question? What's the category? Random. I think this was random. Yeah.

370
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:32,880
 There you go. That's why it's in the random category. Oh, uh, what is, is it? It's just two.

371
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:43,600
 Okay. I'll pass to Paul. Now I've got me questioning. Well, but now I think it is.

372
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,480
 Oh, Arizona's got a little bit.

373
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,840
 One might, one might argue there's a new version of that country in our country

374
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:09,360
 that might border it as well. New Arizona. That's right. Uh, yeah. New Mexico. Um,

375
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:15,360
 Arizona too. Does Arizona have it too? I'll pass.

376
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,840
 Matt, I don't have enough points to guess. So I'm going to pass. My guess is five,

377
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,360
 but I'm passing. I mean, I think it's four, but let's see.

378
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:37,680
 It's four east to west Texas, Arizona, California. We did name them. I got it right. Kind of. I think

379
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:44,400
 we got all of them. Oh, there's no doubt. Paul was right on this one. Sure. Paul, you're up.

380
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,600
 I shouldn't take points away from Paul. I like that we end every show showing everyone how dumb we are.

381
01:05:51,600 --> 01:06:00,480
 What is the name of the actress who played Carrie Heffernan wife of Doug Heffernan for

382
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:08,160
 nine seasons of on king of Queens? Leah remedy. Oh, yeah. Leah remedy. Yay.

383
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:18,080
 Matt sitcom spouses, 2000. What is the name of the actress that played Carol foster wife of Frank

384
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:24,480
 Lambert for seven seasons on step by step? Ah, so there's a show called step by step. You say

385
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:33,680
 Matt, would you like a hint? Oh, I think I'm getting a hint in the chat. One of them says

386
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:39,360
 Paul Abdul, but the other says thymaster. Yeah, that's, that's the big hint. It's exactly who it

387
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:47,600
 is. Uh, Suzanne, some Paula Abdul. That's it. It is Suzanne summer. I like the firm Paul Abdul in

388
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:56,240
 the chat. Somebody just said Paul Abdul. It's me. I'll try a fucking, I'll close out random 2000.

389
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,720
 The three child actors that played three siblings for nine seasons on what popular family sitcom

390
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:11,040
 were actually real life siblings. Nine seasons, what popular family sitcom? Uh,

391
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:20,240
 I mean, there's the Olsen twins, but that's not no, they played one person three and they played

392
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,840
 one person. There was only two of them. There's right. Yeah, there's right.

393
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:37,120
 Huh? Is this a Jonas Brothers thing? Oh, it could be. Yeah. Were they in, or is this going to be like

394
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:43,840
 Dolby Gillis or something? Is this going to be something from the 50s? Dolby Gillis didn't have

395
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:55,440
 any siblings. Hogan's heroes. Right. A family sitcom three. Oh, is it my three sons? It can't

396
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:03,360
 be my three sons. I mean, that's three actors, nine years. I passed the Paul. This is the sopranos.

397
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:17,760
 No, who, who could it be? Three child actors, right? Hey, huh? Oh, no. The Munsters didn't have

398
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,440
 a bunch of kids. So we got like Malcolm in the middle didn't have a, well it has three, but they're

399
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:31,600
 not all, they're not, they're not siblings. No, it wasn't all Warners and the Cosby children.

400
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:41,200
 No, were there twins, triplets? How many seasons has Family Guy been on the air? I'm going to say

401
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:52,800
 Family Guy. Meg Stewie and the other Griffin. Brian. Brian. That's it. No, Chris. Chris is

402
01:08:52,800 --> 01:09:12,240
 the son. Brian's the dog. I have no idea. I'll pass Paul. Oh, um, uh, the, um, Osmond's or the

403
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:21,600
 Jackson five, nine C's gentlemen. We've spent a good deal of time on this question. I think it's

404
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:31,360
 time to move on. I pass that Jesus Christ pass. Everybody loves Raymond. Holy shit. Mattingly.

405
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:37,600
 I didn't know. I didn't know that either. Sawyer and Sullivan, uh, Sweden played by Ali, Jeffrey

406
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,840
 and Michael Barone. You think as someone who's watched zero episodes of that show that I would

407
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:48,000
 know that, but I've seen like two or three, uh, in waiting rooms. Yep. That's better.

408
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:57,920
 Waiting for a screenshot of this is a perfect example of us. We have sitcom spouses and random

409
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:04,240
 gone geography and spelling all on the board. And we didn't do well with the two that we used.

410
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:13,680
 All right. I'll try spelling for 400. Maybe the answer is Tory spell the day known as hump day

411
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:25,120
 follows Tuesday and proceeds Thursday. W E D N E S D A Y. W E D N E S D A Y is correct.

412
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,720
 It's not fair. Cause in the middle is a Nintendo entertainment system. And that's how Paul

413
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:35,280
 remembers that. That's right. Actually is. I remember, I remember I learned how to spell it by,

414
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:41,440
 by learning it phonetically as Wednesday. And that made me remember how it's weirdly spelled.

415
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,560
 Oh, that's exactly what I do in my head. Every time I type it is Wednesday. Yes. Do you really?

416
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:53,760
 Yes. I still do. Yeah. Spelling eight, 800, please spell the calendar much with,

417
01:10:53,760 --> 01:11:01,200
 which contains Valentine's day that follows January and precedes March. J U N E final answer.

418
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:09,520
 F E B R U A R Y.

419
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:19,200
 No, I, I don't think so. Say, say the first, say the first four letters again. F E B R.

420
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:29,920
 Oh yeah. That's right. U A R Y U A R one. That's right. No, F E B R U A R Y. Oh my gosh,

421
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,120
 that's right. I would have misspelled it. What did you, what were you, how are you going to spell it?

422
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:39,360
 F E B U A R Y. Oh no, I knew the R was first. I thought he, I thought Matt said the U first

423
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,480
 and not the R. No, no. I always leave out the R. February. Anything that's almost spells bro.

424
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:53,920
 I'm on top of it. I consider it February. February. February. And now I'm never going

425
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,760
 to be the month. The 28th of those 29 days of trading crypto February.

426
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:08,880
 I'll do spelling for 1200 trading crypto. Spell the small piece of linen silk or other

427
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:16,320
 fabric, usually square and used for wiping one's nose face, et cetera. This would be a total pass

428
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:44,160
 for me. There's no way. Oh yeah. Uh, I got this like C U M R A G. Correct. Correct. Is this tissue

429
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,520
 or a handkerchief? It's had to be handkerchief. G Y M S O C K.

430
01:12:49,520 --> 01:13:05,600
 H A N K E R S P A N K B L A N K E T. S P A N K B U C K E T.

431
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:28,240
 O K K I E C O O K I E J I Z Z R A G. I think it's like chief. I think it's C H I E F.

432
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:37,920
 Yeah. So yeah. H A N K E R C H I E F. Look at that. Oh, oh no. I left out the D handkerchief.

433
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,600
 That's right. That's right. I left out the D and I didn't have enough D in me. I just saw a comedian

434
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:50,240
 talking about that. Like some lady in a store asked him for a handkerchief. He's like, I don't

435
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,840
 have a handkerchief. She's like, what are you talking about? Like she was older lady. He's like,

436
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,440
 you don't carry a handkerchief around. He's like, no, carry a handkerchief around. Like I know that

437
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:08,240
 50 years ago, old, more men carried around a rag that they blew their nose in, wiped their sweat

438
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:14,240
 with coughed into. I'm going to tell you though, Paul, every now and then I carry a handkerchief.

439
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:19,280
 Usually if I'm wearing like a suit or something, no one, you nasty thing. I'll carry the handkerchief

440
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,800
 up. If like I'm wearing a suit or something or like a suit jacket, a lot of times I'll have a

441
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,240
 handkerchief in my, in my suit jacket pocket. Oh, as a decorative, as a decorative corner,

442
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,560
 as they call it. No, no, no, like in, no, in like in the inside pocket. Sewed in though, right?

443
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:39,040
 Sewed in. No, not sewn in. Functional handkerchief. Yes, but I don't blow my nose into it. What you

444
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,880
 don't, what do you do with it then? Yeah, like you mop your brow with it. You impart me. You might,

445
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,600
 you might mop a little something up with it. Or if you, if you need something, you might, you might

446
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,360
 wipe away a tear. You nasty thing. If you're watching an emotional film,

447
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,480
 you can do anything with it. This is now, this is now we're getting deep in Jacob code.

448
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:07,360
 SJ, I'm going to need about 20 minutes. I'm watching an emotional film.

449
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:14,320
 Yes. I actually, I actually have gym socks sewn into my tuxedo jacket.

450
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:27,600
 Paul, you're up. Good Lord. Nasty spelling. For 2000. Spell the appliance usually found in

451
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,680
 a kitchen that is integral in food storage and maintains an optimal cooling temperature

452
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,680
 of 37 degrees to 41 degrees Fahrenheit, three to five degrees Celsius. Hint, not the freezer.

453
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:50,800
 Ah, the car E F R I D G E R A T O R. I think you got it. Yeah. No. What'd you get wrong?

454
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:59,120
 Did you not put a D in there? Oh, you did. Yeah, you did. I did. You put the D in there.

455
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:07,680
 I put my D in the refrigerator. Now we have, but at least I don't carry a handkerchief.

456
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,680
 I was saying Smitty spelled it wrong. Is that true?

457
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:19,520
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There's no D, no D maybe not in your fridge. There's no D in my fridge.

458
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:28,320
 My wife runs the household. Matt, you got geography questions left. And I think there are two daily

459
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,640
 doubles left. Only in my fridge is the defrost setting

460
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:46,800
 geography for 400. Then please daily. Oh God. Name any four of the 10 countries

461
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:57,040
 that have four letter names when written in English. Egypt. No, Chad, Chad, Chad, Iraq, Iran.

462
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:10,800
 Oh shoot. Ithaca, New Jersey. No, I remember we had the 10. I was like, Oh yeah.

463
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:25,280
 Damn it. Cuba. There we go. Cuba, Cuba, Chad, Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Iraq, Laos,

464
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:34,240
 Malay, Mali. That's right. And Togo. Last time we collectively named three and the test

465
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:45,520
 checks out. We almost did it again. We did. I guess it's me. I guess I'll do geography for 800.

466
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:52,720
 Shit. It's the other daily double. They're both still out there. Not anymore. Name four of the

467
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:58,080
 17 states whose state capital is also its most populous city. Hinton, Nevada is not one of the

468
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:07,520
 17. Let's see. California. No, California is not going to be California city. Pennsylvania. I'll bet

469
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,880
 California city. Oh yeah. Pennsylvania. That's, that's going to be one. Philly is going to be more

470
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,560
 popular. Yeah. Philly Philly is going to have the most populous in Pennsylvania. So yeah. So

471
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:25,120
 Pennsylvania is one of them. Uh, Louisiana is not one Kentucky, Kentucky, Kentucky's one. Oh wait,

472
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,400
 Frankfurt, not Louisville. That's right. Yeah. Nobody lives in fucking Frankfurt.

473
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:39,520
 Just the crooks that run the fucking Commonwealth into the ground. Wow. Let's see. New York city is

474
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:47,120
 not the, uh, my old Kentucky home. These nuts. Let's see. Uh, I think, uh, oh, I think, uh,

475
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,560
 Nebraska. I think Lincoln is the state capital of Nebraska. A bunch of people live in there.

476
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,800
 Yeah. Uh, that's, I think that's where everybody lives there. I bet Honolulu is the most populous

477
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:05,280
 of Hawaii. Oh, I don't know. Where else they live in? I'm trying to think. The rest of it's all

478
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:14,960
 volcano. I think you're right. Maui, Maui, Maui, Maui, Maui. And let's see one other one. Let's see.

479
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:23,600
 Uh, a little, one of the little States, um, Rhode Island.

480
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:32,080
 What's the capital Rhode Island? Uh, Hawaii was, I think it's Providence, right? Okay.

481
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:38,480
 Rhode Island's one. Hawaii's one. I don't remember what else I said. You said Pennsylvania.

482
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:44,480
 Oh, I did say Pennsylvania. Is that on there? Pennsylvania. Not on the list. No wonder what it

483
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:49,920
 is in Pennsylvania. I guess it's a Pittsburgh. Must be Pittsburgh. Oh, that doesn't make any,

484
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,960
 is Pittsburgh more populous than Philly? Well, I think that's exactly the question. Paul, you're up.

485
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,720
 Oh, you guys, you guys are throwing shade of Lancaster. That's what's going on.

486
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,520
 Philadelphia is not the, Philadelphia is not the capital. That's the problem. Oh,

487
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:20,400
 that's the entire issue there. Uh, fatal flaw. Uh, misspoke there.

488
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:28,640
 Paul, you had geography for 1200 to 2000. 2000. Let's shoot the moon daddy. Name one of the three

489
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:34,080
 states that shares a border with both a state that borders Canada and with a different state

490
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:41,200
 that borders Mexico. What are the three states? So there are only three of these California three

491
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:47,520
 states that shares a border with both a state that borders Canada and a state that borders Mexico.

492
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,360
 California. I don't think California shares a border with a state that borders Canada.

493
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:01,760
 Oregon, Nevada, and Utah. Oh, Washington and Oregon border, Canada and California and Arizona

494
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:07,680
 borders Mexico. California borders Arizona, which borders Mexico, but it doesn't border anything

495
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:16,240
 that borders Canada. Okay. Close it out. The category already winning anyway. Uh, Matt back

496
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:21,120
 in control of Smitty scooperties, uh, geography for 1200. That's only cause two of my questions

497
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:27,920
 are reduced. Two of my questions. I took the quiz earlier. That's the point of the scooperty. There's

498
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:34,880
 Smitty scooperties. Yeah. Yeah. The four corners monument. The only quadra point in the USA

499
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:42,720
 is where Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and what other state meet? Uh, I get this wrong every time.

500
01:21:44,160 --> 01:22:00,960
 So I will pass that passes to me. I of course know the state. I will pass Paul, Utah,

501
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:14,320
 Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma where the wind blows through the planes. It might be pass. Oh,

502
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:21,120
 Jesus. Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Last time Paul said Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and Italy.

503
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:31,600
 I was being facetious. That is the game. Matt crushed us with 6,400. Paul is in second with

504
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,720
 negative 1,600. I'm in third with negative 2,000. That's from Smitty scoop. Thank you. Smitty scoop.

505
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,880
 If you want to send us a scooperty or price of Sprite jock versus nerd or an obelisk jock versus

506
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,840
 nerd, head over to Hey scoops.com right there on the homepage. You can send us any of those things.

507
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,000
 You could send us some scoop mail, do all the things right over there at Hey scoops.com.

508
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,720
 All I have to do is picture the cross country drives I've done. And it always surprised me

509
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,000
 that Utah goes right into Colorado, but I do remember that from driving.

510
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,600
 So I have to just remember these trips next time I do it. I have gone and stood on the

511
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:09,040
 four corners thing multiple times and I can never remember which states they are. Did you take a

512
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,840
 picture? I'm sure I have. It's just him sitting there and everything just says question mark,

513
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,600
 question mark, question mark, question mark. This place is not labeled well at all.

514
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:29,040
 Thank you. Smitty scoop. I want to thank all of the scoops. We're starting off a brand new year

515
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,760
 and we appreciate all of us, all of you guys who are spending your time during your week,

516
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,480
 putting us in your ears, whether you're driving your cars, wash your dishes, walk your dog,

517
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:44,480
 go to the gym, sitting at home, going in the shower, whatever it takes. We furiously masturbating

518
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:54,240
 awkwardly or casually, making a real meal of it. You know, just thank you so much. We really

519
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,400
 appreciate it. If you want to turn someone onto our podcast, and I really suggest you lead this

520
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,440
 one forward right away. If you know someone out there who could use goose, the musical in their

521
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:21,840
 life, they'll shave every one of us before surgery. Go ahead and just choose one person,

522
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:27,120
 one person only. Otherwise it's a pyramid scheme and those are shady schemes. Don't

523
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:32,480
 talk about the tiny pyramid at the top of the obelisk. It's not at the top of every obelisk.

524
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:38,560
 Yeah. So don't talk about it. If you have a friend who knows Italy's not in the four corners,

525
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,200
 turn them onto this show. This is the moment we thank the people who support us on Patreon. It's

526
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,400
 a brand new month. We're going to get a list together for this month, but we of course thank

527
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:54,080
 the people who find it in their hearts and in their wallets to support us. It's not even the

528
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:02,320
 Pac-Man of the pie chart. It's a Pac-Man with his eyes closed and his mouth closed. It's the full

529
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,560
 Pac-Man with a sliver of a thing that says ad revenue from Twitch and our podcast. So please

530
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:16,640
 know that we basically run ads for show to feel like we're professionals, but we really just rely

531
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:24,560
 people backing us on Patreon. I'm only laughing because it's so true. So please, if you haven't

532
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,480
 supported us yet and you have and you want to, please find a tier that fits your budget over

533
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:53,040
 at PreachingFun.com. Or if you, like me, know that the word basically was doing a lot of heavy

534
01:25:53,040 --> 01:26:07,520
 lifting in Matt's sentence, go over fartsinabag.biz. That's fartsinabag.biz that along with

535
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,520
 PreachingFun.com. It takes you over to our Patreon page where for as little as $3 a month,

536
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,920
 you can upkeep this show on the air. Like Matt said, we are dependent on our Patreons. We love

537
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,160
 each and every one of you. Thank you so much. I should maybe just show the Patreons the email

538
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,840
 we got for last month for like, "Hey, money's coming your way." And then I clicked on it and

539
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:32,240
 went like, "What?" From the ad revenue? Put it this way, our podcast company could not buy

540
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:39,920
 Jacob and Jameson on New Year's Eve. Oh no. And they're pretty reasonably priced. They're

541
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:47,440
 pretty reasonably priced. Oh no. That's right. We are dependent on our Patreon supporters out

542
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:53,440
 there. As little as $3, you could do the support every month. You can do it for the year. If you

543
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,920
 do it for the year, you get a little discount on there. And it really helps us out. It lets

544
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:03,680
 us do this thing that hopefully you're enjoying as well. Yeah. And if we break over a certain

545
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,160
 month, rather than give you a bonus episode, we will go to community college for geography.

546
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:15,040
 That's what we will do. We'll take a CSN course. Speak for yourself. I'd rather bonus episode.

547
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,920
 Uh, thanks for everybody. Stay safe out there. We love you and we'll see you soon.

548
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:55,200
 We're sending that preaching smarts.

549
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:06,560
 Never claimed to be paying extra for tire care is BS, you know, bad service. So at Midas,

550
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,600
 we're rolling out our BS free tire guarantee included with paid installation and tax on every

551
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:17,040
 purchase. You'll pay nothing for flat replacements, nada for flat repairs and Zilch for tire

552
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:23,520
 rotations every 5,000 miles. That's $0 for all that. So with this limited lifetime tire guarantee,

553
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,760
 you'll pay a whole lot of nothing compared to what the other guys charge for tire care.

554
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,360
 That's the BS free tire guarantee only at Midas.
