**[0:00:00]** Why does the black flat cap feel more pretentious than the other caps?

**[0:00:12]** Yeah, that's what I mean. You look like you look like you're you're a bit of a patty enforcer

**[0:00:18]** You are a patty enforcer Matt. Hello. This is my favorite part of this show. It's my drag day

**[0:00:24]** This is the part of this show where we thank you the ice cream truck drivers. Thank you ice cream truck drivers

**[0:00:40]** If you want to be an ice cream truck driver, maybe you just want to be a patty driver

**[0:00:44]** I don't know head on over to preaching fun calm preaching fun commas

**[0:00:48]** We're gonna sign up to be an ice cream truck driver and who knows the life you save

**[0:00:53]** Maybe your own it's time for a program. Hey Johnny. Do you want to go to an ice cream social?

**[0:01:03]** Yeah, I'd love to great. Let's go

**[0:01:06]** So Jacob the fancy microphone you brought me when I travel

**[0:01:12]** Got me pulled out of TSA because they thought the adapter on the mic was a bullet

**[0:01:19]** What?

**[0:01:21]** Where the fuck were you?

**[0:01:23]** It's time for Matt Maddly's ice cream social sitting in prison. That's Matt Donnelly sitting in Pittsburgh. That's Paul Maddly

**[0:01:30]** I'm Jacob in Vegas

**[0:01:32]** We're preaching fun fun. So I I know exactly what you're talking about that big

**[0:01:37]** Nobby thing. I have one too

**[0:01:42]** Yes, so it's the

**[0:01:46]** Shore the shore little

**[0:01:48]** microphone connector

**[0:01:51]** Adapted to an XLR connection is what you're referring to and it gives power right? It gives power to the microphone

**[0:01:56]** Yeah, the the your recorder is sending phantom power to it as well, which is I think

**[0:02:03]** Forty something volts. I don't remember what it is. So I you know pack my heaviest stuff and put it on my carry-on

**[0:02:11]** To get weight out of my case for when I travel with my magic stuff

**[0:02:15]** Ah

**[0:02:16]** So one of the items is shackles. They're actual iron shackles

**[0:02:22]** and then my jar of rings

**[0:02:27]** My thing of rope and so it got it got pulled out at the Fort Lauderdale Airport

**[0:02:35]** and I

**[0:02:38]** You know

**[0:02:39]** I'm thinking it's gonna be about the shackles which only one time someone was like you can't you can't travel with these and I

**[0:02:44]** Was like, oh I sure can and for some reason that worked and then they let me go

**[0:02:50]** Yeah, I was like no I travel with them all the time

**[0:02:54]** and

**[0:02:54]** And all of a sudden he goes. Oh, it's this right here and he pulls up the microphone

**[0:02:57]** I go what he goes this is this adapter and the x-ray looks like it looks like a high caliber of bullets

**[0:03:05]** That's it my high caliber bullets is this guy bit x-ray my singular shot my my one

**[0:03:12]** One high caliber bullet I'm taking with me to assassinate the pilot from the back of the plane with my sniper rifle

**[0:03:19]** back and to the left

**[0:03:22]** Matt the man with the golden gun Donnelly exactly

**[0:03:26]** Don't mind me carry just just carries one bullet. Just the jackal making my way through the Florida Airport

**[0:03:37]** I'm actually shooting my target is at the Miami Airport. I'm that good. I'm shooting high wind

**[0:03:42]** From one airport to another it's one of those shots where you have to check the wind first. Yeah. Yeah, it's a whole big thing

**[0:03:49]** It's like one giant bullet will be traveling into a private jet taking out from Miami Airport

**[0:03:55]** Don't be traveling via private jet

**[0:03:57]** Yes, and it's not shot out of a gun because I didn't pack that so it's I just I just wheel my shackles like

**[0:04:03]** A slingshot and they put the bullet in there and I sling it like David and then boom

**[0:04:09]** Then as long as you do it in the plane

**[0:04:12]** Then the bullet is traveling at the speed of the plane in addition to the speed that the earth is already rotating

**[0:04:18]** You're able all the velocity. I need just comes from the flight itself. I just drop the bullet out the window

**[0:04:24]** It's like throwing pennies off the Empire State Building

**[0:04:29]** That's why I always request the seat with the rolled-out window that

**[0:04:34]** The product the proposition that you're creating the the the

**[0:04:39]** Strategic crazy scenario you're creating could actually be the plot of an episode of Golgo 13

**[0:04:46]** 13 Golgo 13. He's an incredible assassin and it one of my favorite anime

**[0:04:54]** acid ass acid anime and manga of all time and go go 13 does constantly those kinds of

**[0:05:01]** Impossible assassinations that he's just a gun for hire. He's like this cold

**[0:05:07]** Merciless killer you pay him enough money

**[0:05:09]** He will do whatever needs to be done and then the investigators are always this close to figuring out

**[0:05:14]** But then they're like no fucking way could anybody do this

**[0:05:19]** Line a lot of other things should use that same plot line and then they go back then they go back and they go

**[0:05:25]** Oh fuck. He did do that

**[0:05:28]** They show you how he fucking did it and it's like what holy shit. Yeah, go go 13 is

**[0:05:37]** Unstoppable

**[0:05:39]** Bossy says I'm actually just throwing it like a dart from the back of the plane to hit the pilot just yeah

**[0:05:46]** The physics physics checks out nobody check it but the physics checks

**[0:05:49]** All you do is hold it in your hand on the numbers

**[0:05:52]** Hold it in your hand while you're landing and then just let go and let let gravity do the work

**[0:05:58]** That's right. Like I like my idea is when teenagers jump up and down inside of an elevator. Uh-huh

**[0:06:04]** Yeah, same same thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:06:09]** All right, are any of you watching land man

**[0:06:15]** No, man. I love land man. Okay, we we haven't started the new season yet, but we burned through the first season

**[0:06:22]** I hung back until there's four episodes and now I'm four episodes caught up with a new season is this who is this?

**[0:06:29]** Who's the land is Billy Bob Thornton Thornton?

**[0:06:32]** Demi Moore is in it. Oh, he's fantastic

**[0:06:36]** Yeah, the whole cast is really killer. Okay Myron Chach is not willing to pay for Paramount respect respect on that

**[0:06:44]** There's just there are websites you can go to time to sail the seas

**[0:06:47]** Now you just gonna start now go the full other direction Myron steal steal the show

**[0:06:53]** That's it

**[0:06:58]** So

**[0:06:59]** Landman for those who don't watch the show. It's the most popular show on Paramount plus and Billy Bob Thornton plays a grizzled

**[0:07:06]** foul-mouth

**[0:07:07]** Smoking land man where he is there meaning what?

**[0:07:12]** So land man are people who own oil fields small smaller oil operators, right?

**[0:07:19]** Ah working for the big guns, but they're just trying to get by

**[0:07:22]** Which is definitely something that Matt and I knew before watching land man. Sure

**[0:07:27]** Well, this is it Taylor Sheridan for whether you want to what do you want to go with cause or symptom?

**[0:07:33]** He is simply basically between Yellowstone and mayor of Kingstown, you know

**[0:07:40]** in

**[0:07:41]** 1923 and he shows like he basically

**[0:07:44]** takes pockets of where white dudes might feel obsolete and

**[0:07:50]** Gives them monologues and speeches that that kind of build up, you know, these these broken ways of life, right and

**[0:07:58]** Here's the thing. I

**[0:08:00]** Actually like at first like used to I feel conflicted about this right here

**[0:08:05]** Because this is you know, the way of the way of this country is going right now

**[0:08:08]** It seems like that's that's a big force behind a big imaginary force behind a lot of a lot of actions being taken

**[0:08:16]** Yeah

**[0:08:20]** I'm doing a show on the on the cruise ship and I get this guy up on stage and he is

**[0:08:27]** Basically me like 1.5 me in size like exact body type just six foot five

**[0:08:34]** and just a little wider and thick arms or whatever and I

**[0:08:40]** say

**[0:08:41]** You know, hi, you know, what do you do for a living?

**[0:08:44]** You know, do you work that kind of stuff and he goes I work in the oil and gas distribution

**[0:08:48]** from Texas

**[0:08:50]** Yes

**[0:08:51]** Yes, and I say because basis like my dad growing up hated law shows

**[0:08:56]** So he hated the way the law was portrayed

**[0:09:00]** On television and it made people stupid questions all the time

**[0:09:05]** So I wonder if that's better or worse now or if it's just the same

**[0:09:09]** For like new legal dramas because I feel like the new legal dramas try to stay more true to the law

**[0:09:14]** They don't ones do but like they're still ridiculous legally

**[0:09:19]** Yeah, my dad was just laughs like how quickly they can like get like lab results and stuff like that

**[0:09:24]** Like he's just like they get lab results like the next day or the same way on in the chat is saying they are

**[0:09:29]** Not much better Jacob

**[0:09:30]** Okay. Yeah, right

**[0:09:32]** Leon is our barrister. He is

**[0:09:36]** Their Leon he's our law man

**[0:09:39]** We need a law man, so I say

**[0:09:44]** Do you love or hate the show land man?

**[0:09:48]** Good and he like literally turns to me

**[0:09:52]** Like like doesn't doesn't like he's like we're not having a conversation. He just turns to me and he goes. Oh

**[0:09:57]** That is the most accurate portrayal of the oil and gas

**[0:10:01]** I have ever seen on TV or movies and he almost has tears in his eyes

**[0:10:09]** Wow

**[0:10:12]** You know now there is fascinating shit in the show

**[0:10:15]** There is shit that you do not you never thought about the oil and gas industry sure there is like really they really do do

**[0:10:20]** a good job of like

**[0:10:23]** Villages where the where the workers like live like the house villages, you know things like that

**[0:10:28]** It's it's really fascinating. It's neat stuff. There's one was like there's an there's an oil

**[0:10:34]** Area left all alone and therefore there's like a toxicity thing that can happen

**[0:10:39]** So they come across dead bodies and then also they go what's going on on the alarms go off on their uniforms and they go

**[0:10:45]** running

**[0:10:45]** So they don't die and you're like, oh right. I had no idea no idea that that kind of scenario

**[0:10:53]** There are electronic canaries in the coal mine now. Yeah. Yeah, they've got it

**[0:10:57]** Yeah, it's a little like gas meters and by the way the same thing for I think nuclear stuff by the way, Matt

**[0:11:02]** I know this wasn't intentional, but you just basically told a Trump rally story

**[0:11:08]** Saying there was big guy big guy came up to me and I turned to him

**[0:11:12]** I said, do you like land man or not and with tears in his eyes big guy big guy tears in his eyes

**[0:11:19]** I love land man. He tells me let me people are saying Paul and with that I'll finish out

**[0:11:24]** He said no one's ever asked me about land man before only you know, I'm joking

**[0:11:29]** I

**[0:11:36]** Didn't take the no one ever knows it's all about me and how I'm unique

**[0:11:42]** He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said that is the best question anyone has ever asked me about land man

**[0:11:54]** Sensational question such a good question giant man who weep

**[0:11:59]** You asked the best questions that's not only my noodler. So it's it is teaching you all kinds of

**[0:12:06]** Actual tricks of the trade within the land man community

**[0:12:10]** It is like any good show and that is a voyeur. It's a it's a voyeuristic

**[0:12:15]** You know the thing where you're getting a pocket of the world. You wouldn't normally get a pocket out of right?

**[0:12:22]** It's still filled with its weird weird monologues, you know things like that

**[0:12:29]** Season opens with Billy Bob doing a big monologue about breakfast and like the waitresses the most important meal of the day

**[0:12:34]** and he just lectures her about who profits from breakfast and blah blah blah blah blah and it's just

**[0:12:39]** Taylor shared it just has these monologues that are just atrocious

**[0:12:43]** and one-dimensional

**[0:12:45]** But you tolerate Billy Bob Thornton or Kevin Costner doing them, right? It's almost like a challenge, you know

**[0:12:51]** I can do this. I got this

**[0:12:55]** Yeah, I'll I do

**[0:12:57]** Watching land man. All I do is talk like Billy Bob Thornton the entire time and it makes SJ really happy. Yeah

**[0:13:03]** No, but I was trying I was trying to think about my man on the ship and I was trying to think about like

**[0:13:07]** You know, he came up on like my family call like when my brothers is really into what my brothers thinks

**[0:13:11]** it's it's a piece of shit show right and it was kind of like right, you know them them's fighting words and

**[0:13:18]** I mean I kind of I get both arguments

**[0:13:23]** I

**[0:13:23]** Everyone's right

**[0:13:24]** But you know we talk on this like these these weird times and I and I and I was basically kind of like

**[0:13:33]** thinking about

**[0:13:34]** Basically is the word obsolete

**[0:13:36]** That okay. That is the word like I've been trying to find a way

**[0:13:40]** to put my

**[0:13:42]** To encapsulate I think attention that's driving all this shitty decisions

**[0:13:46]** Like I think like so many things that are shitty about this world or not, you know themselves

**[0:13:49]** I think caused by one thing. I think their dominoes were pushed, right?

**[0:13:54]** Whether we're talking about like Trump ism or you know ice detentions that kind of stuff like all these crazy shit

**[0:13:59]** That's happening. Ah, and I think like if I'm trying if it was

**[0:14:06]** You know go my walks

**[0:14:07]** I was thinking about my friend on the other ship and then my brother's fighting and and I was like I

**[0:14:14]** Think that like part of

**[0:14:18]** Like AI and technology and basically tech tech has taken all of the money, right and

**[0:14:24]** All of the talent and now has seized all of the power right like like tech runs

**[0:14:30]** Washington and Tex runs all of media now, right? Yeah

**[0:14:34]** And the billion and the billionaires are more richer than us than ever

**[0:14:38]** Right, and then I think like basically like we're all afraid of

**[0:14:42]** Our ways of life becoming obsolete from one facet or another because of this, right? Okay. Yes

**[0:14:49]** I see what you mean now. Yeah, and so like if I feel like shit is on my doorstep and

**[0:14:55]** You tell me to help other people because they're doing something. They're experiencing something less fortunate and

**[0:15:03]** I feel like no one's talking about what's making my life unfortunate

**[0:15:06]** Right, like if I think I'm cool and not obsolete if I feel like I am thriving

**[0:15:11]** You tell me to help somebody else. Yeah, I go like cool. No problem

**[0:15:17]** But if you come to me and say, you know

**[0:15:20]** No one's doing stuff about these poor people over here and you're like wait mom about to lose my whole fucking way of life

**[0:15:25]** Yeah, I just got back from the food bank and you're telling me that that this is a problem over here

**[0:15:30]** And I don't process that tension properly, right? I don't process that like I think my way of life is going away

**[0:15:37]** Right, you know, like even we do on our show. We were do really like oh, we're just three white dudes talking

**[0:15:41]** Right. And so like we reduce ourselves to be like wait the world should be more diverse. We're not diverse enough

**[0:15:46]** We're getting older. We're done with mainstream things. We're over here in our little pocket, right?

**[0:15:50]** like we do to ourselves a little bit, you know, I would say actually Paul's probably the biggest voice that fights against it and

**[0:16:00]** Like and then you tell us to help go help something else is a little bit like I'm trying to fucking hold it down here

**[0:16:05]** Right, but you don't want to admit that you don't want to admit that I'm trying to hold it down

**[0:16:10]** You don't want to admit that you're afraid of losing it all right?

**[0:16:14]** you want to have pride and stuff like that and so I feel like this ups and then I think the

**[0:16:19]** Lockdown and pandemic just poured accelerant all over this tension

**[0:16:24]** And I think like it's really hard to shake that feeling

**[0:16:30]** So like I'm thinking that like I think that's a way

**[0:16:34]** To fight against what we're doing in a positive way

**[0:16:37]** I think you have to identify if someone is feeling like they're being made to feel obsolete

**[0:16:44]** And you have to find ways in yourself and other people make them feel like they can thrive

**[0:16:48]** And I feel like if you do that, that would be the first way to put a force against what we're doing

**[0:16:53]** It's a very deep thought it was on my mind

**[0:16:55]** It was all because I was watching land man and we can we can talk about something else

**[0:16:59]** I have a very embarrassing story to follow up with this if this goes nowhere, but

**[0:17:07]** Now that the ultimate solution

**[0:17:11]** For people in a political place where what they're doing is terribly unpopular

**[0:17:18]** Their ultimate solution is I'm going to give people money

**[0:17:22]** But unfortunately that should always be the thing the government should be helping

**[0:17:28]** The citizenry to elevate their standard of living constantly

**[0:17:33]** Yeah, we came up we came out of the pandemic with the wrong lessons learned when they did help bolster us and give us

**[0:17:40]** what was tantamount to a

**[0:17:42]** Basic, you know median basic income right, you know subsidy

**[0:17:47]** Yes, which we've got and and you spoke by the way. Here's your money back, right?

**[0:17:53]** But we spoke to pride if that's exactly right Jacob

**[0:17:56]** And we spoke we spoke to pride right or you talked about that man. Yeah, we need to look at that in a whole

**[0:18:02]** Other way we have conditioned a generation to look at any benefit coming from the government as something unnecessary

**[0:18:10]** shameful and to be repelled

**[0:18:13]** Right, which is crazy because what are you paying them for then if not to work for now?

**[0:18:18]** We're all working together our society to they are our

**[0:18:21]** Representatives they are our representatives they are to represent our interests and if our interests currently

**[0:18:28]** Require that we get some kind of financial

**[0:18:32]** Benefits and incentives to move forward in a proper way. Not just certain groups is that's what's happening already

**[0:18:38]** Farmers are getting a lot of incentives real soon

**[0:18:41]** Yeah again yet again, and it's still not gonna be enough

**[0:18:45]** But we don't even have to we don't even have to bag on the farmers

**[0:18:48]** No, we can just talk about the things we're already talking about

**[0:18:51]** Let's just talk about the people in the oil industry. Oh, we're just being handed money fucking forget about it

**[0:18:56]** Exactly people who are being handed money for no reason, but when but when little

**[0:19:03]** People look at the same kind of thing we have we have been socially engineered to be like, oh no

**[0:19:09]** I don't need anything. I don't need help. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a handout

**[0:19:12]** It's a handout on the small scale on the large scale. It's capitalism, right?

**[0:19:18]** Yeah, no, I mean yeah, it's it's it is strange and complicated are it's bizarre and

**[0:19:26]** Giant men coming to you with tears in their eyes

**[0:19:35]** No, I'll tell you who else has giant men coming on them with tears in their eyes all the time wait

**[0:19:41]** I didn't get that part of the story yet

**[0:19:45]** That's the following sponsor today's show is brought to you by the fine people providers purveyors and makers of

**[0:19:53]** Greek yogurt, that's right. It's just a commercial for Greek yogurt for 2022. That's from the scoop Henley

**[0:19:59]** We're talking about Greek yogurt. All right

**[0:20:03]** That that it that it that it that it that it it

**[0:20:07]** Hey

**[0:20:08]** Python

**[0:20:09]** You needed some yogurt. Hey, I got you. I got you. What do you need?

**[0:20:16]** Come on over. He said a good Greek stuff. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:20:24]** This here yogurt got a little bit of the tomato and a basil

**[0:20:29]** Yeah, fresh from the Greek island

**[0:20:36]** Hey, why don't you put a little is a Greek yogurt all over your piece of pie

**[0:20:43]** Over your piece of pie. How about you put a little bit in it inside of the pasta sauce

**[0:20:49]** Yeah, and just a little bit of zest now. That's a Greek

**[0:20:57]** Oh

**[0:20:58]** When you're here you're a family extra Greek yogurt everybody with it a breadstick yummy

**[0:21:08]** Pasta fuzz you like Greek yogurt. Mmm. Yummy. Yummy manja

**[0:21:21]** Yeah

**[0:21:22]** Yeah, no, I I don't think me it like like basically while I was wrapped up in that beautiful commercial

**[0:21:30]** I mean sure oil tree sure the farms sure all of college sure all of medicine

**[0:21:35]** Sure, all like like we have been quietly always

**[0:21:40]** Training wheels and pushing every industry, right? And so, you know

**[0:21:46]** We have never the successful industries, right?

**[0:21:50]** And so like we have never

**[0:21:55]** Been a purely

**[0:21:56]** Capitalistic thing but as soon as we want to point at something and say stop doing that we say like see it's not capitalism

**[0:22:02]** It's socialism but raw

**[0:22:04]** But the truth is we've buttressed our entire country almost every aspect of our lives

**[0:22:09]** With government effort and it's been successful. Like it's what's made America

**[0:22:14]** And so it's like we improv Matt improv

**[0:22:23]** Improv in all of its forms

**[0:22:26]** Vallis Bolan was paid by the federal government

**[0:22:30]** Again an initiation of theater games for children during the Great Depression

**[0:22:37]** Improvisation is germinated from that government investment an entire my life

**[0:22:44]** My life from this woman's brilliance and the government funding that made it possible for her to do

**[0:22:52]** That's it. I agree. The only way for improv comedy to be successful is to have government backing

**[0:23:00]** The fucking fact I would love to have a little government jingle in my pocket every time I was teaching

**[0:23:06]** Holy shit make things real smooth, but just in general that needs to be

**[0:23:13]** yeah, we and I mean art is the first thing that gets it in the dick and

**[0:23:19]** Yeah, you know, I know it's like so like I mean we're

**[0:23:23]** very much out of our depths in terms of talking specifically about

**[0:23:27]** For yourself over

**[0:23:29]** What we know this is our wheel. Yeah, man. Yeah. Hello

**[0:23:33]** But I think part of like we're trying to get people to chill is to be like is is a little bit of a wake-up

**[0:23:38]** Like hey, we've been kind of doing this with everything the whole time and it's not just just the lefties

**[0:23:44]** It's not just the righties and it's not just what so that what you're saying is the solution to this might be

**[0:23:50]** Education. Oh good. Good

**[0:23:54]** Then that's assured that we're gonna move forward in a positive direction then because that's gonna be a priority going forward

**[0:24:02]** Linda fucking McMahon

**[0:24:04]** Is running of all things I can't even watch WWE anymore

**[0:24:09]** Not even no, not even like recap shit. Nothing. I haven't watched it for like a year. It's terrible

**[0:24:16]** It's like this is your it's the oh, it's real life professional wrestling

**[0:24:21]** I know it's done so much damage to the earth

**[0:24:24]** I listen to the whole fucking planet. They're gonna have a fucking you have see fight

**[0:24:37]** By the same company

**[0:24:40]** Go

**[0:24:42]** Yeah, you're right. All right. I'm definitely gonna go ice cream socials going to the UFC fight in the front

**[0:24:50]** Press pass, of course, although oh did you turn out ever?

**[0:24:54]** Did you see the explosive new?

**[0:25:00]** Confession I don't know what you'd have you how you actually say it. Are you familiar with the

**[0:25:06]** Canadian screw job

**[0:25:08]** Yes, the Montreal Montreal screw job, right? Oh this this is the the the Bret Hart thing

**[0:25:13]** Michaels, aha

**[0:25:15]** Tell me what happened. So Bret Hart was wrestling in his hometown

**[0:25:19]** he was gonna retire from the WWE or leave the WWE go somewhere else or whatever and

**[0:25:24]** They said you have to turn over your heavyweight belt to the new upcoming star Shawn Michaels

**[0:25:29]** And he said not in Montreal not in my home city

**[0:25:32]** Like we have to we'll have to do it another at another match

**[0:25:36]** Okay, and it's like this is where I'm from and this is where I can take a lot of pride in me being the heavyweight champion

**[0:25:43]** you know, we'll do a fight there, but it's got to be a different time and

**[0:25:48]** Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels colluded behind Bret Hart's back and the Bret Hart

**[0:25:54]** Is fighting out of some chokehold or something like that and gets basically called out and loses the match and the look on his face

**[0:26:01]** When the bell goes off and thing is over this and they're gonna give Shawn Michaels the belt the look at his face is

**[0:26:07]** Crazy and it is a famously

**[0:26:11]** When the most moment in WWE where they broke quote-unquote kayfabe, right?

**[0:26:17]** When it's a very shoot moment. Yeah, meaning it was happening for real. It was happening for real

**[0:26:23]** And I think Brett wouldn't like punched Victor convinced McMahon

**[0:26:26]** I think like or something like that least spit on him. I think

**[0:26:31]** It on him and maybe punched him too. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:26:35]** So but it made so much news that they had to break

**[0:26:39]** kayfabe to break the the the the fakeness of wrestling because it was

**[0:26:44]** Leaking out that this was a crazy thing that happened behind the scenes. Uh-huh. Well

**[0:26:49]** Brett Hart has just this past week come out and said

**[0:26:54]** you

**[0:26:55]** Know Vince McMahon would always come on these specials

**[0:26:59]** Whenever they were talking about the Montreal screw job and Vince's famous quote was

**[0:27:03]** We didn't screw Brett Brett screwed Brett

**[0:27:07]** Right. That was his favorite. Okay

**[0:27:10]** well

**[0:27:11]** according to Brett Hart

**[0:27:13]** It may be more accurate to say

**[0:27:17]** Vince screwed Shawn Michaels

**[0:27:20]** Wait

**[0:27:23]** There is a rumor now

**[0:27:26]** Brett Hart has put forth that

**[0:27:28]** Michaels and Vince McMahon may wear hat we're flat

**[0:27:32]** at that point and that is a big reason why

**[0:27:36]** Vince put the belt on him and went through all that rigamarole because that was his current love boy

**[0:27:42]** I find it hard to believe that you can sleep your way to the top and WWE under Vince McMahon

**[0:27:46]** I know right unless you're willing to take a shit directly to the face. It's not really

**[0:27:51]** You're not your career is not really going to of course, this is what happened. This is obviously what happened

**[0:27:57]** This man is a depraved animal. So the Montreal mudslide proceeded the Montreal

**[0:28:06]** Exactly exactly and that's how Brett that's how Shawn lost his smile because he got shit

**[0:28:13]** Yeah

**[0:28:14]** Pretty ridiculous

**[0:28:16]** Finally something that we know about

**[0:28:18]** Leon saying it's the Montreal steamer. That's right

**[0:28:21]** That's a good one Leon. Yeah, so that I didn't I didn't look into it too far

**[0:28:27]** I just heard enough from what I heard and I was like, okay, but

**[0:28:32]** Brett's usually a pretty straight shooter

**[0:28:35]** Or he knows this is the most scathing thing you can say about Vince McMahon I

**[0:28:40]** May be but why now I guess cuz I don't know I think is he just actually

**[0:28:46]** Levitations he wants to kick him in the nuts. Yeah, maybe he just wants to yeah

**[0:28:51]** He would have come out I did follow this a little bit and I think it would have come out sooner had this actually

**[0:28:57]** Been the case. Oh

**[0:28:59]** Really? Don't you think they didn't?

**[0:29:04]** Know media if you know anything about the ring boy scandals and all the other bullshit

**[0:29:09]** That's been going on and all this stuff that's followed the McMahons around for decades

**[0:29:14]** It's only really been having a light shone on it very recently. That's had any kind of

**[0:29:20]** Consequence or public discussion about it. All right, that's reached. I hear you. I hear that. I hear that that makes sense

**[0:29:27]** Yeah, so I feel like yeah, I feel like there's a great deal more scrutiny

**[0:29:30]** I just think we're more attuned to it now and it's one of those things where back in the day

**[0:29:35]** You get stuff like that. Well, he's a very he's a very successful man. Of course, he's got haters

**[0:29:40]** You know, of course, there's people after him and gonna start rumors and stuff

**[0:29:44]** But now with all the things that we do know about him and his and his crew

**[0:29:49]** I don't want to think my neck out

**[0:29:51]** I don't want to you know stepping at the way these guys are to the they can be very litigious

**[0:29:55]** But I don't think he's really that tan. I think that's I think that's fake. I think basic man is a fake

**[0:30:04]** Don't sue me up

**[0:30:06]** Okay, okay. That was that's Matt at hey scoops.com. That's who said that

**[0:30:13]** Tan is real. I think he's just I think he's just in a tanning bed

**[0:30:17]** I don't think he uses like oh, yeah, he's gone out of the beach

**[0:30:21]** No, so let's fight about that. No, so I

**[0:30:25]** Speaking of wrestling

**[0:30:26]** I've grown to love John Cena as peacemaker and John Cena as a comedic actor

**[0:30:30]** Sure, and I never watched any wrestling with John Cena. Okay

**[0:30:35]** So five move Charlie

**[0:30:37]** So he sat down to do an interview with Bill Simmons my favorite sports podcaster and talked to him for like over an hour

**[0:30:44]** I was like, all right, let's do it. And then it was all about his wrestling career and man

**[0:30:52]** You couldn't pay me to ever listen to John Cena talk about his wrestling career ever again

**[0:30:58]** The problem with that so I bought the I bought the problem with that Paul one of the problem

**[0:31:05]** I bought the WWE game from I'm gonna say three years ago two years ago three three years ago and

**[0:31:12]** Let's say three, let's say three, whatever

**[0:31:16]** The cop the conceit of this one was Cena, right?

**[0:31:21]** But not only Cena it was Cena recapping his biggest losses

**[0:31:26]** So that's the story mode that you play through you play through you play through as John Cena

**[0:31:32]** Through his biggest losses. Yeah, and the thing and he he entered he is interviewed between each match

**[0:31:39]** Talking about what he learned and what the atmosphere was like during this match and special things about the opponent

**[0:31:45]** I kind of thing and it just comes off so crazy

**[0:31:49]** Because like it's very

**[0:31:53]** This isn't real, right? Right. It's not real. Yeah things he's saying aren't really reason

**[0:31:59]** Oh boy, I knew coming into that ring was gonna be a real slobber knocker go

**[0:32:04]** I knew my competition with Andre the giant was gonna be exactly. It's like well

**[0:32:09]** I don't think you ever fought Andre

**[0:32:12]** But like an example because I listened to this fucking interview

**[0:32:15]** Yeah, like he had to lose very badly to Brock Lesnar so that okay put up against Brock Lesnar would be then considered

**[0:32:24]** so

**[0:32:25]** Amazingly great that they had to write champion. So in order to put I think it was Roman Reigns

**[0:32:31]** The belt he had to get beat beat up by Brock Lesnar very badly. That'd be okay

**[0:32:35]** They talked about like trying to like, you know way that now hard that was physically and everything else and you know

**[0:32:42]** No, it's not it shouldn't be

**[0:32:46]** No one gets hurt, I mean yes, it's painful it's stressful. It's very athletic

**[0:32:52]** But you shouldn't be interesting people. It's dangerous shit. It's dangerous

**[0:32:57]** Okay, hold on because I want to come back to this we do have to go to a sponsor real quick

**[0:33:02]** But I want to come back to this so we're putting a pin in this and we're gonna talk about this right after we get

**[0:33:07]** Back from the following sponsor who?

**[0:35:44]** Ever heard the two worms make music they ever heard them sing in the moonlight

**[0:35:49]** No, well, you could get some and do it and the best way to hear them is by listening through a tube

**[0:36:27]** To say worth shit

**[0:36:31]** Loose to this tube don't do fuck for you

**[0:36:35]** So I'm thinking about pro wrestling now, oh, oh danger zone is there

**[0:36:42]** Is it just impossible for people to pretend that someone is better?

**[0:36:49]** Than us or has won a championship or something like that

**[0:36:53]** Is it just impossible for us to just pretend that that's happening? Do we do we just fall into the trap of this is real?

**[0:36:59]** every time

**[0:37:00]** Is that why it matters to the WWF people or WWE people who wears the the fake championship belt?

**[0:37:07]** It's so strange because like I guess

**[0:37:11]** Cena on this last trip around came close to if not

**[0:37:16]** Eclipsed Rick Flair's

**[0:37:18]** title runs I

**[0:37:21]** Know he has I have seen that yeah, because it's seen it seen as like I don't remember

**[0:37:26]** It's been a couple more time 18 or 19 time world champion something like that. Yeah. Yeah

**[0:37:31]** Anyway, it's but it just like one or two above Rick Flair

**[0:37:36]** But you know

**[0:37:39]** What does it mean but having having the belt doesn't it doesn't actually mean you haven't actually won

**[0:37:46]** Also, you can't win it 17 times if you don't lose it 16

**[0:37:51]** So what the fuck is that? I think

**[0:37:55]** Good point. That's just good. That's also true. That's math. Yeah, that's that's just the math checks out on what Paul just said

**[0:38:00]** But I mean like really like you guys there's 16 guys who are clearly better than you

**[0:38:05]** They are still beholden to the crowd

**[0:38:11]** The crowd the live crowds and they're in and their audiences for sure

**[0:38:15]** Yes, if they make the wrong person champion, they hear about it, right? Oh, yes

**[0:38:19]** You know, it matters it matters for their business that certainly matters. Yeah

**[0:38:23]** Is more of like the mental is it is it possible for human beings to pretend that someone is the champion

**[0:38:33]** Without kind of falling into that trap

**[0:38:38]** Well, I think we should have every mouth finger butthole champion on this podcast come back on and talk about their lives after

**[0:38:44]** Winning mouth good boy. Good boy. I don't know eyes have changed you watch enough of that wrestling and it just gets

**[0:38:52]** It gets crazy

**[0:38:54]** I'll never know. I will never I will not put myself to that test

**[0:38:59]** My kids I would have if my kids got into wrestling I would have my kids did not get into wrestling

**[0:39:04]** And and I think thank goodness and I still love the old classic goofy shit

**[0:39:09]** I think it's funny as hell but I appreciate it just for the the goofiness of it all

**[0:39:15]** But then you start if you start to really scratch at it. It just gets sad real fast

**[0:39:20]** You know, well, you know most things you know

**[0:39:22]** They're they're plenty of spots on me if you scratch at them long enough. It gets real sad

**[0:39:27]** I often just stare at Jacob until I feel sad

**[0:39:30]** That's basically what I do to get it going to stare at Jacob while he's scratching when I want to drum up

**[0:39:36]** You said this I do that

**[0:39:39]** Um

**[0:39:41]** Paul yes, what are you asking for your wife free for yourself for Christmas? Oh

**[0:39:48]** nothing

**[0:39:50]** Do you guys get each other stuff? Yeah, I got I got and a

**[0:39:55]** New coffee maker and a giant and of Green Gables box set. Oh, by the way

**[0:39:59]** Yeah, I want to step on this for a second the amount of like ho ho ho someone works for Starbucks

**[0:40:04]** Good coffee maker at home. Stop pretending like every fucking employee of Starbucks becomes like some coffee goddess for they have

**[0:40:14]** Or whatever like it was possible to be a regular human being with an aged coffee maker

**[0:40:20]** This is the problem get a job at Starbucks. It was only it was only like three years old

**[0:40:25]** It was a good coffee maker

**[0:40:26]** It just happened to get a stink bug in it and that made her physically unable

**[0:40:32]** coffee maker anymore

**[0:40:35]** She legit just vomited everywhere. She couldn't look at the machine anymore without getting physically sick

**[0:40:41]** That's the there was nothing wrong with this coffee maker. It was fancy

**[0:40:45]** Damn, you know you press the shit and the new one. I got hers fucking fancy Dan

**[0:40:49]** It's got a milk steamer thing on it and all kind of hoodly-hoo. It's fancy. It's a nice coffee maker

**[0:40:55]** It was like, you know almost $200 coffee maker that I got on super sale at my old Tarjay

**[0:41:01]** Paying for itself there a little bit milk that milk spritzer doubles as a Swedish hot bidet if you use it properly

**[0:41:08]** An upside-down Swedish hot. Oh, you just gave me a nightmare

**[0:41:13]** Oh god damn talk about oh for fuck's sake

**[0:41:18]** Swedish hot bidet. Oh

**[0:41:22]** Damn it

**[0:41:23]** I can think a few things more horrific than

**[0:41:28]** Superheated items up the asshole and I know that was a medieval staple slow nowadays

**[0:41:34]** Oh, come on take talk. It's lower. No, no, no

**[0:41:38]** How hot is hot what I just what would you do like the the original the original pain

**[0:41:53]** What happens after you shoot stevie milk into your asshole then the trouble starts that's what I but it really does it's

**[0:42:01]** It's Pandora's box

**[0:42:03]** It's Pandora's butthole

**[1:05:10]** Okay. Okay, the disco riot Kaminsky Park was not an actual event that killed disco

**[1:05:18]** What it was was an event that was supposed to be it was drummed up by a radio DJ a DJ

**[1:05:23]** I'll do it and it ended up being this incredibly racist event where everyone brought a bunch of blues and R&B records

**[1:05:30]** To it and then it broke out of this riot, but it was basically racially fueled

**[1:05:35]** So it's one of the most weirdest reported things in it

**[1:05:39]** Well, it's used as a cornerstone in the disco show where I'm like, that's not what happened as a baby child of the 70s

**[1:05:46]** I remember growing up with that whole disco sucks thing

**[1:05:49]** Yeah coming through his baby turns out that whole mantra that whole movement was just anti

**[1:05:56]** LGBTQIA stuff man, it was just yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's all racist and racist

**[1:06:01]** Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's all just stems from don't let people enjoy

**[1:06:06]** The music that supports their their lifestyle and their culture. It's just awful. It's awful. This country is crazy

**[1:06:35]** Maybe even did some jail time

**[1:06:36]** I don't know back when there's a bunch of like niche cool podcast companies coming out this one

**[1:06:40]** I'm trying to I can't remember remember it now

**[1:06:48]** His and in his breakdown of what happened the day disco died

**[1:06:52]** It was a really great podcast

**[1:06:55]** At one point he basically has to like hide and run

**[1:07:00]** Because of what was happening in the park. What's that on? I have to find it. It's been so long

**[1:07:04]** It's listen to it forever ago, but obviously that a huge impact on me

**[1:07:08]** Swedish scoop is saying that was a double header and the second game had to be forfeited

**[1:07:13]** Laurie is saying it was a huge deal, but I believe they had to just call the game. No jail time
